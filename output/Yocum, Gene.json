These compounds demonstrated increased resistance to phase 2 metabolism and avoided the formation of a 6H isomer. Compound design was guided by molecular docking using the available crystal structure of the \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 GABAAR and correlated with in vitro binding data. The carboxylic acid containing GABAAR ligands have high aqueous solubility, low permeability, and low cell toxicity. The inability of GABAAR ligands to cross the blood-brain barrier was confirmed in vivo by the absence of sensorimotor inhibition. Pharmacological activities at lung GABAARs were demonstrated by ex vivo relaxation of guinea pig airway smooth muscle and reduction of methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in conscious mice.

Various GABAAR (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor) activators, including benzodiazepines, relax ASM. The GABAAR is a ligand-operated Cl- channel best known for its role in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Although ASM cells express GABAARs, affording a seemingly logical site of action, the mechanism(s) by which GABAAR ligands relax ASM remains unclear. PI320, a novel imidazobenzodiazepine designed for tissue selectivity, is a promising asthma drug candidate. Here, we show that PI320 alleviates methacholine (MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction in\u00a0vivo and relaxes peripheral airways preconstricted with MCh ex vivo using the forced oscillation technique and precision-cut lung slice experiments, respectively. Surprisingly, the peripheral airway relaxation demonstrated in precision-cut lung slices does not appear to be GABAAR-dependent, as it is not inhibited by the GABAAR antagonist picrotoxin or the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that PI320 inhibits MCh-induced airway constriction in the absence of external Ca2, suggesting that PI320-mediated relaxation is not mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ influx in ASM. However, PI320 does inhibit MCh-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in peripheral ASM, a key mediator of contraction that is dependent on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ mobilization. Furthermore, PI320 inhibits peripheral airway constriction induced by experimentally increasing the intracellular concentration of inositol triphosphate (IP3). These novel data suggest that PI320 relaxes murine peripheral airways by inhibiting intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in ASM, likely by inhibiting Ca2+ release through IP3Rs (IP3 receptors).", "Keywords": ["GABAA receptor", "IP3 receptor", "asthma", "benzodiazepine", "precision-cut lung slice"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Flumazenil", "Inositol", "Ligands", "Lung", "Methacholine Chloride", "Mice", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Smooth", "Picrotoxin", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose F", "Last Name": "Perez-Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Dannah Rae", "Last Name": "Sajorda", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Webb", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and."}, {"First Name": "Leggy A", "Last Name": "Arnold", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "35246861", "Title": "Comparative pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study of MIDD0301 and its (S) enantiomer.", "Abstract": "MIDD0301 is being developed as an oral drug to relax airway smooth muscle (ASM) and reduce lung inflammation in asthma.

Both imidazodiazepines showed affinity toward the GABAAR binding site of clonazepam, with IC50 values of 576 and 242 nM, respectively. Molecular docking analysis, using the available \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 GABAAR structural data, suggests binding of the diazepine core between the \u03b11+/\u03b32- interface, whereas alkyl substituents are located outside the binding site and thus interact with the protein surface and solvent molecules. The physicochemical properties of these compounds are very different. The solubility of PI310 is low in water. PEGylation of PI320 significantly improves aqueous solubility and cell permeability. Neither compound is toxic in HEK293 cells following exposure at >300 \u03bcM for 18 h. Ex vivo studies using guinea pig tracheal rings showed that PI310 was unable to relax the constricted airway smooth muscle. In contrast, PI320 induced muscle relaxation at organ bath concentrations as low as 5 \u03bcM, with rapid onset (15 min) at 25 \u03bcM. PI320 also reduced airway hyper-responsiveness in vivo in a mouse model of steroid-resistant lung inflammation induced by intratracheal challenge with INF\u03b3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At nebulized doses of 7.2 mg/kg, PI320 and albuterol were equally effective in reducing airway hyper-responsiveness. Ten minutes after nebulization, the lung concentration of PI320 was 50-fold that of PI310, indicating superior availability of PI320 when nebulized as an aqueous solution.

Asthma severity is associated with airway inflammation; therefore, reducing airway inflammation is an important therapeutic target. Gelsolin is an actin capping and severing protein that has been reported to be involved in modulation of the inflammatory response. Using mice genetically lacking gelsolin, we evaluated the role of gelsolin in the establishment of house dust mite (HDM) antigen-induced allergic lung inflammation. The genetic absence of gelsolin was found to be protective against HDM sensitization, resulting in reduced lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokines, and Muc5AC protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and interstitial macrophages in the BAL were increased after HDM sensitization in wild-type mice but were attenuated in gelsolin-null mice. The observed attenuation of inflammation may be partly due to delayed migration of immune cells, because the reduced eosinophils in the BALs from gelsolin-null mice compared with controls occurred despite similar amounts of the chemoattractant eotaxin. Splenic T cells demonstrated similar proliferation rates, but ex vivo alveolar macrophage migration was delayed in gelsolin-null mice. In vivo, the reduced lung inflammation after HDM sensitization in gelsolin-null mice was associated with significantly diminished airway resistance to inhaled methacholine compared with HDM-treated wild-type mice.

Here, we demonstrate that MIDD0301 relaxes histamine-contracted guinea pig ( P < 0.05, n = 6-9) and human ( P < 0.05, n = 6-10) tracheal smooth muscle ex vivo in organ bath experiments, dilates mouse peripheral airways ex vivo in precision-cut lung-slice experiments ( P < 0.001, n = 16 airways from three mice), and alleviates bronchoconstriction in vivo in mice, as assessed by the forced-oscillation technique ( P < 0.05, n = 6 mice). Only trace concentrations of the compound were detected in the brains of mice after inhalation of nebulized 5 mM MIDD0301. Given its favorable pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrated ability to relax ASM in a number of clinically relevant experimental paradigms, MIDD0301 is a promising drug candidate for bronchoconstrictive diseases, such as asthma.", "Keywords": ["GABA", "MIDD0301", "asthma", "flexiVent", "organ bath", "receptor"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "GABA Agents", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Ligands", "Lung", "Male", "Muscle, Smooth", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Trachea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose F", "Last Name": "Perez-Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Danielsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Aisha S", "Last Name": "Kuforiji", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guanguan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "M S", "Last Name": "Rashid Roni", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Revathi", "Last Name": "Kodali", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Douglas C", "Last Name": "Stafford", "Affiliation": "Milwaukee Institute for Drug Discovery, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Leggy A", "Last Name": "Arnold", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University , New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

MIDD0301 relaxed airway smooth muscle at single micromolar concentrations as demonstrated with ex vivo guinea pig tracheal rings. MIDD0301 also attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in an ovalbumin murine model of asthma by oral administration. Reduced numbers of eosinophils and macrophages were observed in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid without changing mucous metaplasia. Importantly, lung cytokine expression of IL-17A, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1 were reduced for MIDD0301-treated mice without changing antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels. Automated patch clamp confirmed amplification of GABA induced current mediated by \u03b11-3,5\u03b23\u03b32 GABAARs in the presence of MIDD0301. Pharmacodynamically, transmembrane currents of ex vivo CD4+ T cells from asthmatic mice were potentiated by MIDD0301 in the presence of GABA. The number of CD4+ T cells observed in the lung of MIDD0301-treated mice were reduced by an oral treatment of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. for 5 days. A half-life of almost 14 h was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies (PK) with no adverse CNS effects when treated mice were subjected to sensorimotor studies using the rotarod. PK studies also confirmed very low brain distribution. In conclusion, MIDD0301 represents a safe and improved oral asthma drug candidate that relaxes airway smooth muscle and attenuates inflammation in the lung leading to a reduction of AHR at a dosage

"Title": "GABAA receptor \u03b14-subunit knockout enhances lung inflammation and airway reactivity in a murine asthma model.", "Abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that hypnotic anesthetics affect immune function. Many anesthetics potentiate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing \u03b14-subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR \u03b14-subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra40/0 ) mice. Wild-type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to PBS intranasally 5 days/wk for 3 wk. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (P = not significant; n = 4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (P < 0.05, n = 8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (P < 0.05; n = 4) and increased markers of lung T-cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; P < 0.01, n = 4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4+ cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T-cell receptor as compared with WT CD4+ cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR \u03b14-subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization. Thus GABAAR \u03b14-subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.", "Keywords": ["eosinophil", "flexiVent", "house dust mite antigen", "lymphocyte", "organ bath"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Pneumonia", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Th2 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; gty2102@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Damian L", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Danielsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Barajas", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dingbang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gregg E", "Last Name": "Homanics", "Affiliation": "Departments of Anesthesiology, Neurobiology, and Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

airway smooth muscle tone and calcium handling.", "Abstract": "Asthma is a common disorder characterized, in part, by airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperresponsiveness. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective cation channel expressed on airway nerve fibers that modulates afferent signals, resulting in cough, and potentially bronchoconstriction. In the present study, the TRPV1 transcript was detected by RT-PCR in primary cultured human ASM cells, and the TRPV1 protein was detected in ASM of human trachea by immunohistochemistry. Proximity ligation assays suggest that TRPV1 is expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of human ASM cells in close association with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2. In guinea pig tracheal ring organ bath experiments, the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin led to ASM contraction, but this contraction was significantly attenuated by the sodium channel inhibitor bupivacaine (n = 4, P < 0.05) and the neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist GR-159897 (n = 4, P < 0.05), suggesting that this contraction is neutrally mediated. However, pretreatment of guinea pig and human ASM in organ bath experiments with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine-induced contraction (n = 4, P < 0.01 for both species). Similarly, capsazepine inhibited methacholine-induced contraction of peripheral airways in mouse precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) experiments (n = 4-5, P < 0.05). Although capsazepine did not inhibit store-operated calcium entry in mouse ASM cells in PCLS (n = 4-7, P = nonsignificant), it did inhibit calcium oscillations (n = 3, P < 0.001). These studies suggest that TRPV1 is expressed on ASM, including the SR, but that ASM TRPV1 activation does not play a significant role in initiation of ASM contraction.

Airway Smooth Muscle to Alleviate Bronchoconstriction.", "Abstract": "We previously demonstrated that airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells express \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), and that GABA(A)R agonists acutely relax ASM. Among the GABA(A)R \u03b1 subunits, human ASM cells express only \u03b14 and \u03b15, providing the opportunity for selective pharmacologic targeting. Novel GABA(A)R-positive allosteric modulators designed for enhanced \u03b14/\u03b16 subunit selectivity were synthesized using iterative computational analyses (CMD-45 and XHe-III-74). Studies using oocyte heterologous expression systems confirmed that CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 led to significantly greater augmentation of currents induced by a 3% maximal effective concentration (EC3) of GABA [EC3]-induced currents in oocytes expressing \u03b14 or \u03b16 subunits (along with \u03b23 and \u03b32) compared with other \u03b1 subunits. CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 also led to greater ex vivo relaxation of contracted wild-type mouse tracheal rings compared with tracheal rings from GABA(A)R \u03b14 subunit (Gabra4) knockout mice. Furthermore, CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 significantly relaxed precontracted human ASM ex vivo, and, at a low concentration, both ligands led to a significant leftward shift in albuterol-mediated ASM relaxation. In vivo, inhaled XHe-III-74 reduced respiratory system resistance in an asthmatic mouse model. Pretreatment of human ASM cells with CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 inhibited histamine-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations in vitro, an effect that was lost when calcium was omitted from the extracellular buffer, suggesting that inhibition of calcium influx due to alterations in plasma membrane potential may play a role in the mechanism of ASM relaxation. Selective targeting of the GABA(A)R \u03b14 subunit with inhaled ligands may be a novel therapeutic pathway to treat bronchoconstriction, while avoiding sedative central nervous system effects, which are largely mediated by \u03b11-3 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs in the brain.", "Keywords": ["CMD-45", "GABAA receptor", "XHe-III-74", "asthma", "flexiVent"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchoconstriction", "Calcium", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle, Smooth", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Trachea", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Gallos", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rajwana", "Last Name": "Jahan", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Michael Rajesh", "Last Name": "Stephen", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Zdravko", "Last Name": "Varagic", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Roshan", "Last Name": "Puthenkalam", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Margot", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "25659897", "Title": "Selective targeting of the \u03b15-subunit of GABAA receptors relaxes airway smooth muscle and inhibits cellular calcium handling.", "Abstract": "The clinical need for novel bronchodilators for the treatment of bronchoconstrictive diseases remains a major medical issue. Modulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) chloride via GABAA receptor activation to achieve relaxation of precontracted ASM represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic option. Since human ASM GABAA receptors express only the \u03b14- and \u03b15-subunits, there is an opportunity to selectively target ASM GABAA receptors to improve drug efficacy and minimize side effects. Recently, a novel compound (R)-ethyl8-ethynyl-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methyl-4H-benzo[f]imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] diazepine-3-carboxylate (SH-053-2'F-R-CH3) with allosteric selectivity for \u03b15-subunit containing GABAA receptors has become available. We questioned whether this novel GABAA \u03b15-selective ligand relaxes ASM and affects intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) regulation. Immunohistochemical staining localized the GABAA \u03b15-subunit to human ASM. The selective GABAA \u03b15 ligand SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 relaxes precontracted intact ASM; increases GABA-activated chloride currents in human ASM cells in voltage-clamp electrophysiology studies; and attenuates bradykinin-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, and methacholine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in peripheral murine lung slices. In conclusion, selective subunit targeting of endogenous \u03b15-subunit containing GABAA receptors on ASM may represent a novel therapeutic option to treat severe bronchospasm.", "Keywords": ["GABAA \u03b15-subunit", "SH-053-2\u2032F-R-CH3", "airway relaxation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bradykinin", "Bronchial Spasm", "Bronchoconstriction", "Bronchodilator Agents", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Diazepam", "GABA-A Receptor Agonists", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Ion Channel Gating", "Male", "Methacholine Chloride", "Muscle, Smooth", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Respiratory System"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Gallos", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York; gg2125@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Matthew E", "Last Name": "Siviski", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Yim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Xiao Wen", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Poe", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Perez-Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics; and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York;"}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.
