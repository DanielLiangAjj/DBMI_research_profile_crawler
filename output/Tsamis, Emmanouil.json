This region, which is about 12\u00a0degrees (3.5\u00a0mm) in diameter, is essential for everyday functions such as driving, reading, and face recognition. Here, we describe a model of progression of glaucomatous damage to this GCL donut. This model is based upon assumptions supported by the literature, and it predicts the patterns of glaucomatous damage to the GCL donut, as seen with optical coherence tomography (OCT). After describing the assumptions and predictions of this model, we test the model against data from our laboratory, as well as from the literature. Finally, three uses of the model are illustrated. One, it provides an aid to help clinicians focus on the essential central macula and to alert them to look for other, non-glaucomatous causes, when the GCL damage does not fit the pattern predicted by the model. Second, the patterns of progression predicted by the model suggest alternative end points for clinical trials. Finally, the model provides a heuristic for future research concerning the anatomic basis of glaucomatous damage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Nerve Fibers", "Glaucoma", "Retina", "Macula Lutea", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Intraocular Pressure"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sol", "Last Name": "La Bruna", "Affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ari", "Last Name": "Leshno", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel A", "Last Name": "Gomide", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mi Jeung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "George A", "Last Name": "Cioffi", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carlos Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Emmanouil", "Last Name": "Tsamis", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "PubDate": "2023Dec01"}, {"PMID": "38031282", "Title": "Glaucoma Detection Using Optical Coherence Tomography: Reviewing the Pitfalls of Comparison to Normative Data.", "Abstract": "Optical coherence tomography is essential in managing glaucoma.

To maximize the chance of success, we utilized all available information from the OCT circle and cube scans, applied both quantitative and semiquantitative data analysis methods, and aimed to limit the use of perimetry to cases where it is absolutely necessary. The outcome of this approach was an OCT-based method for the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy that did not require the use of perimetry for initial diagnosis.

Recent work suggests that the OCT probability (p-) maps, also known as deviation maps, can play a key role in an OCT-based method. However, artifacts seen on the p-maps of healthy control eyes can resemble patterns of damage due to glaucoma. We document in section 2 that these glaucoma-like artifacts are relatively common and are probably due to normal anatomical variations in healthy eyes. We also introduce a simple anatomical artifact model based upon known anatomical variations to help distinguish these artifacts from actual glaucomatous damage. In section 3, we apply this model to an OCT-based method for detecting glaucoma that starts with an examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) p-map. While this method requires a judgment by the clinician, sections 4 and 5 describe automated methods that do not. In section 4, the simple model helps explain the relatively poor performance of commonly employed summary statistics, including circumpapillary RNFL thickness. In section 5, the model helps account for the success of an AI deep learning model, which in turn validates our focus on the RNFL p-map.

It is also a challenge. The most sophisticated, and probably the most useful, commercially available clinical tool for identifying progression is the Guided Progression Analysis (GPA), which was initially developed to identify progression using 24-2 visual field tests. More recently, it has been extended to retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, the OCT GPA requires a minimum of 3 tests to determine \"possible loss (progression)\" and a minimum of 4 tests to determine if the patient shows \"likely loss (progression).\" Thus, it is not designed to answer a fundamental question asked by both the clinician and the patient, namely: Did damage progress since the last visit? Some clinicians use changes in summary statistics, such as global/average circumpapillary RNFL thickness. However, these statistics have poor sensitivity and specificity due to segmentation and alignment errors. Instead of relying on the GPA analysis or summary statistics, one needs to evaluate RNFL and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer probability maps and circumpapillary OCT B-scan images. In addition, we argue that the clinician can make a better decision about suspected progression between 2 test days by topographically comparing the changes in the different OCT maps and images, in addition to topographically comparing the changes in the visual field with the changes in OCT probability maps.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Disk", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Bruna", "Last Name": "Melchior", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

Therefore, we should be comparing arcuate patterns of damage seen on VFs with those seen on optical coherence tomography (OCT) maps. Instead, clinicians often use summary metrics such as VF pattern standard deviation, OCT retinal nerve fiber (RNF) global thickness, etc. There are 2 major impediments to topographically comparing patterns of damage on VF and OCT maps. First, until recently, it was not easy to make these comparisons with commercial reports. While recent reports do make it easier to compare VF and OCT maps, they have shortcomings. In particular, the 24-2 VF covers a larger retinal region than the commercial OCT scans, and, further, it is not easy to understand the topographical relationship among the different maps/plots within the current OCT reports. Here we show how a model of RNF bundles can overcome these problems. The second major impediment is the lack of a quantitative, and automated, method for comparing patterns of damage seen on VF and OCT maps. However, it is now possible to objectively and automatically quantify this agreement. Together, the RNF bundle model and the automated structure-function method should improve the power of topographical methods for detecting glaucoma and its progression. This should prove useful in clinical studies and trials, as well as for training and validating artificial intelligence/deep learning approaches for these purposes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychology."}, {"First Name": "Zane Z", "Last Name": "Zemborain", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychology."}, {"First Name": "Emmanouil", "Last Name": "Tsamis", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychology."}, {"First Name": "Carlos Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of glaucoma", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32445700", "Title": "Optical Gap Biomarker in Cone-Dominant Retinal Dystrophy.", "Abstract": "To characterize the progression of optical gaps and expand the known etiologies of this phenotype.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Child", "Color Vision Defects", "Cone-Rod Dystrophies", "Disease Progression", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Retrospective Studies", "Stargardt Disease", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "rab GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jin Kyun", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; State University of New York at Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose Ronaldo", "Last Name": "Lima de Carvalho", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Ophthalmology, Empresa Brasileira de Servicos Hospitalares, Hospital das Clinicas de Pernambuco, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil; Department of Ophthalmology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Sarah R", "Last Name": "Levi", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emmanouil", "Last Name": "Tsamis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivienne C", "Last Name": "Greenstein", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vinit B", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA; Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.

intravascular flow in the microvasculature. Swept-source OCT technology utilizes longer-wavelength infrared light than conventional spectral-domain OCT. This enables improved penetration into tissue and imaging through optical opacities and is invisible to the subject. Topcon has recently developed an innovative OCTA algorithm, OCTARA (OCTA Ratio Analysis), which benefits from being paired with swept-source OCT. OCTARA aims to provide improved detection sensitivity of low blood flow and reduced motion artifacts without compromising axial resolution. In this chapter, we describe the implementation of OCTARA with swept-source OCT technology, the technical specifications of acquisition (e.g. the number of scans, area of examination field, etc.) along with the algorithm's function and principles for analysis of B-scan data to achieve angiographic visualization. Examples of OCTA scans performed using the OCTARA algorithm and a comparison of these scans with images obtained using other technologies are also presented.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Angiography", "Animals", "Choroid", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Retinal Vessels", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paulo E", "Last Name": "Stanga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emmanouil", "Last Name": "Tsamis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Papayannis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Stringa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Assad", "Last Name": "Jalil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Developments in ophthalmology", "PubDate": "2016"}]
