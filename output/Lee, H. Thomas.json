Cathepsins are involved in extracellular and systemic functions such as systemic inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation. Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is responsible for numerous diseases including myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, stroke and acute graft failure after transplant surgery. Inflammation plays a major role in the reperfusion phase of IR injury and previous research has shown that cathepsins are key mediators of the inflammation cascade as well as apoptosis.

Heart-to-kidney signals transmitted by \"cardiorenal connectors\" have been postulated, but investigation into CRS-1 has been limited by technical limitations and a paucity of models. To address these limitations, we developed a translational model of CRS-1, cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR), and now report findings from nanoscale mass spectrometry proteomic exploration of glomerular filtrate 2 hours after CA/CPR or sham procedure. Filtrate acquisition was confirmed by imaging, molecular weight and charge distribution, and exclusion of protein specific to surrounding cells. Filtration of proteins specific to the heart was detected following CA/CPR and confirmed with mass spectrometry performed using urine collections from mice with deficient tubular endocytosis. Cardiac LIM protein was a CA/CPR-specific filtrate component. Cardiac arrest induced plasma release of cardiac LIM protein in mice and critically ill human cardiac arrest survivors, and administration of recombinant cardiac LIM protein to mice altered renal function. These findings demonstrate that glomerular filtrate is accessible to nanoscale proteomics and elucidate the population of proteins filtered 2 hours after CA/CPR.

Isoflurane is a widely used halogenated volatile anesthetic during the perioperative period and protects against endothelial cell death and inflammation. In this study, we tested whether isoflurane induces endothelial ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and cytoprotective adenosine generation to protect against endothelial cell injury. Clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane induced CD73 activity and increased adenosine generation in cultured human umbilical vein or mouse glomerular endothelial cells. Surprisingly, isoflurane-mediated induction of endothelial CD73 activity occurred within 1 hr and without synthesizing new CD73. We determined that isoflurane rapidly increased CD73 containing endothelial microparticles into the cell culture media. Indeed, microparticles isolated from isoflurane-treated endothelial cells had significantly higher CD73 activity as well as increased CD73 protein. In vivo, plasma from mice anesthetized with isoflurane had significantly higher endothelial cell-derived CD144+ CD73+ microparticles and had increased microparticle CD73 activity compared to plasma from pentobarbital-anesthetized mice. Supporting a critical role of CD73 in isoflurane-mediated endothelial protection, a selective CD73 inhibitor (APCP) prevented isoflurane-induced protection against human endothelial cell inflammation and apoptosis. In addition, isoflurane activated endothelial cells Rho kinase evidenced by myosin phosphatase target subunit-1 and myosin light chain phosphorylation. Furthermore, isoflurane-induced release of CD73 containing microparticles was significantly attenuated by a selective Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632). Taken together, we conclude that the volatile anesthetic isoflurane causes Rho kinase-mediated release of endothelial microparticles containing preformed CD73 and increase adenosine generation to protect against endothelial apoptosis and inflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["5'-Nucleotidase", "Adenosine", "Adenosine Diphosphate", "Amides", "Anesthetics, Inhalation", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Cadherins", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Cell-Derived Microparticles", "Endothelial Cells", "Enzyme Activation", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Isoflurane", "Kidney Glomerulus", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase", "Pyridines", "Signal Transduction", "rho-Associated Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mihwa", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ahrom", "Last Name": "Ham", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Katelyn Yu-Mi", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "H Thomas", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24511138", "Title": "Renalase prevents AKI independent of amine oxidase activity.", "Abstract": "AKI is characterized by increased catecholamine levels and hypertension. Renalase, a secretory flavoprotein that oxidizes catecholamines, attenuates ischemic injury and the associated increase in catecholamine levels in mice. However, whether the amine oxidase activity of renalase is involved in preventing ischemic injury is debated. In this study, recombinant renalase protected human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells against cisplatin- and hydrogen peroxide-induced necrosis. Similarly, genetic depletion of renalase in mice (renalase knockout) exacerbated kidney injury in animals subjected to cisplatin-induced AKI. Interestingly, compared with the intact renalase protein, a 20-amino acid peptide (RP-220), which is conserved in all known renalase isoforms, but lacks detectable oxidase activity, was equally effective at protecting HK-2 cells against toxic injury and preventing ischemic injury in wild-type mice. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with RP-220 or recombinant renalase rapidly activated Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and downregulated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In summary, renalase promotes cell survival and protects against renal injury in mice through the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, independent of its ability to metabolize catecholamines, and we have identified the region of renalase required for these effects.

Kidney hypoxia or ischemia-reperfusion injury inevitably occurs during surgery involving renal or aortic vascular occlusion and is one of the leading causes of perioperative AKI. Despite the growing incidence and tremendous clinical and financial burden of AKI, there is currently no effective therapy for this condition. The pathophysiology of AKI is orchestrated by renal tubular and endothelial cell necrosis and apoptosis, leukocyte infiltration, and the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Effective management strategies require multimodal inhibition of these injury processes. Despite the past theoretical concerns about the nephrotoxic effects of several clinically utilized volatile anesthetics, recent studies suggest that modern halogenated volatile anesthetics induce potent anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and antiapoptotic effects that protect against ischemic AKI. Therefore, the renal protective properties of volatile anesthetics may provide clinically useful therapeutic intervention to treat and/or prevent perioperative AKI.
