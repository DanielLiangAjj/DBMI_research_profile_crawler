A Quasiexperimental Study of High- Versus Low-Adoption States.", "Abstract": "Background: Over the last decade, the utilization of molecular testing (MT) for the evaluation of thyroid nodules has increased. Rates and patterns of adoption of MT and its effect on thyroidectomy rates nationally are unknown. Varying rates of MT adoption at the state level provide an opportunity to study the effects of MT on thyroidectomy rates using a quasiexperimental study design. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of American adult patients in the Merative\u2122 MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases who underwent thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from 2011 to 2021. MT included commercially available DNA and RNA platforms and traditional targeted mutational analysis. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the inflection of MT adoption and thyroidectomy rates after 2015. Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to causally analyze the effect of MT adoption on thyroidectomy rates in high-adoption (at least a 10% increase in MT utilization) versus low-adoption states (no more than 5% increase in MT utilization) from 2015 to 2021. Results: We identified 471,364 patients who underwent thyroid FNA. The utilization of MT increased over the study period from 0.01% [confidence interval, CI: 0.00% to 0.02%] to 10.1% [CI: 9.7% to 10.5%], in 2021, with an immediate (\u03b22\u2009=\u20091.61, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and deeper (\u03b23\u2009=\u20090.6, p\u2009<\u20090.001) increase in MT adoption after 2015. Utilization of MT was lower in black patients, the elderly, rural areas, and patients with Medicaid (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Thyroidectomy rates were inversely correlated with MT utilization (r\u2009=\u2009-0.98, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). From 2015 to 2021, the average MT utilization rate increased from 2.4% to 15.3% in high-adoption states and 1.6% to 5.6% in low-adoption states. In low-adoption states, thyroidectomy rates decreased more but to similar levels (18.5-13.2%) compared with high-adoption states (15.9-13.4%) with an adjusted DID rate of -3.3% [CI -5.6% to -0.8%]. Conclusions: The acceleration in adoption of MT after 2015 likely coincides with the publication of American Thyroid Association guidelines. Black, elderly, and rural patients are less likely to receive MT. Although thyroidectomy rates were inversely correlated with MT utilization, our study suggests that this correlation is not causal. The effect of MT on thyroidectomy rates may be overshadowed by decreasing aggressiveness of thyroid nodule evaluation.", "Keywords": ["molecular testing", "thyroid nodules", "thyroidectomy"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Aged", "Thyroidectomy", "Thyroid Neoplasms", "Retrospective Studies", "Thyroid Nodule", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yongmei", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie J", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer H", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine M", "Last Name": "McManus", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "38194234", "Title": "Regional Variation in Antenatal Late Preterm Steroid Use Following the ALPS Trial.", "Abstract": "The publication of the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids (ALPS) trial in February 2016 demonstrated that antenatal administration of betamethasone in the late preterm period (between 34 to 36 weeks of gestation) for individuals with a high risk of delivery decreased neonatal respiratory morbidity.

Twenty-eight studies were selected (prostate = 7, endometrial = 14, bladder = 1, rectal = 5, multiple cancers = 1) and all were retrospective. Thirteen and 23 studies examined racial and ethnic differences in individual patients' receipt of RAS and MIS, respectively. Black patients were less likely to receive RAS/MIS than White patients in most studies. Hispanic patients were less likely to receive RAS/MIS than White patients in just over half of the studies. Studies of Asian patients were few and reported mixed results. Three studies examined disparities on the center level and found that racial and ethnic minority prostate cancer patients were less likely to be treated at RAS-performing or high-technology facilities.

Placenta percreta, the most severe form of placenta accreta spectrum (grade 3E), occurs when the placenta invades through the myometrium and possibly into surrounding structures next to the uterine corpus. Maternal morbidity of placenta percreta is high, including severe maternal morbidity in 82.1% and mortality in 1.4% in the recent nationwide U.S. statistics. Although cesarean hysterectomy is commonly performed for patients with placenta accreta spectrum, conservative management is becoming more popular because of reduced morbidity in select cases. Treatment of grade 3E disease involving the urinary bladder, uterine cervix, or parametria is surgically complicated due to the location of the invasive placenta deep in the maternal pelvis. Cesarean hysterectomy in this setting has the potential for catastrophic hemorrhage and significant damage to surrounding organs. We propose a step-by-step schema to evaluate cases of grade 3E disease and determine whether immediate hysterectomy or conservative management, including planned delayed hysterectomy, is the most appropriate treatment option. The approach includes evaluation in the antenatal period with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to determine suspicion for placenta previa percreta with surrounding organ involvement, planned cesarean delivery with a multidisciplinary team including experienced pelvic surgeons such as a gynecologic oncologist, intra-operative assessment including gross surgical field exposure and examination, cystoscopy, and consideration of careful intra-operative transvaginal ultrasound to determine the extent of placental invasion into surrounding organs. This evaluation helps decide the safety of primary cesarean hysterectomy. If safely resectable, additional considerations include intra-operative use of uterine artery embolization combined with tranexamic acid injection in cases at high risk for pelvic hemorrhage and ureteral stent placement.

We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches, as also illustrated by a case study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Neoplasms", "Transcriptome", "Precision Medicine", "Medical Oncology", "Antineoplastic Agents"], "Authors": [{"First

increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Currently, the only effective strategy for ovarian cancer risk reduction is risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RR-BSO), which carries adverse effects related to early menopause. There is ongoing investigation of inhibition of the RANK ligand (RANKL) with denosumab as a means of chemoprevention for breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 P/LP variants. Through the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) Early Phase Clinical Trials Prevention Consortia, a presurgical pilot study of denosumab was developed in premenopausal carriers of P/LP BRCA1/2 variants scheduled for RR-BSO with the goal of collecting valuable data on the biologic effects of denosumab on gynecologic tissue. The study was terminated early due to the inability to accrue participants. Challenges which impacted the conduct of this study included a study design with highly selective eligibility criteria and requirements and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical to reflect on these issues to enhance the successful completion of future prevention studies in individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Salpingo-oophorectomy", "Denosumab", "Pilot Projects", "Pandemics", "Mutation", "COVID-19", "BRCA1 Protein", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Breast Neoplasms", "Ovariectomy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meghna S", "Last Name": "Trivedi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nadir", "Last Name": "Arber", "Affiliation": "Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Eitan", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University Medical School, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Judy E", "Last Name": "Garber", "Affiliation": "Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Holcomb", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Neil S", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "J Jack", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Lana A", "Last Name": "Vornik", "Affiliation": "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Saba", "Last Name": "Abutaseh", "Affiliation": "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Tawana", "Last Name": "Castile", "Affiliation": "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Edward R", "Last Name": "Sauter", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Dimond", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Brandy M", "Last Name": "Heckman-Stoddard", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Goli", "Last Name": "Samimi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Powel H", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Katherine D", "Last Name": "Crew", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "PubDate": "2022Nov01"}, {"PMID": "35948482", "Title": "Intravesical Therapy Compared to Radical Cystectomy Among Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Requiring Additional Treatment After Induction BCG.", "Abstract": "Many patients with recurrent high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer after intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG) face a difficult decision between radical cystectomy (RC) or salvage intravesical therapy (IVT).

However, the routine examination of screening as a regular health checkup of women is characterized as time-consuming and labor-intensive, while there is lack of characteristic phenotypic profile and quantitative analysis. In this research, over the analysis of a privately collected and manually annotated dataset of 130 cytological whole-slide images, the authors proposed a deep-learning diagnostic system to localize, grade, and quantify squamous cell abnormalities. The system can distinguish abnormalities at the morphology level, namely atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as differential phenotypes of normal cells. The case study covered 51 positive and 79 negative digital gynecologic cytology slides collected from 2016 to 2018. Our automatic diagnostic system demonstrated its sensitivity of 100% at slide-level abnormality prediction, with the confirmation with three pathologists who performed slide-level diagnosis and training sample annotations. In the cellular-level classification, we yielded an accuracy of 94.5% in the binary classification between normality and abnormality, and the AUC was above 85% for each subtype of epithelial abnormality.

The majority of endometrial cancer is low grade, and nearly 1 of every 8 low-grade endometrial cancer diagnoses occurs in women younger than 50 years with early-stage disease. The incidence of early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer is increasing particularly among women in their 30s. Women with early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer generally have a favorable prognosis, and hysterectomy-based surgical treatment alone can often be curative. In young women with endometrial cancer, consideration of ovarian conservation is especially relevant to avoid both the short-term and long-term sequelae of surgical menopause including menopausal symptoms, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and osteoporosis. Although disadvantages of ovarian conservation include failure to remove ovarian micrometastasis (0.4%-0.8%), gross ovarian metastatic disease (4.2%), or synchronous ovarian cancer (3%-5%) at the time of surgery and the risk of future potential metachronous ovarian cancer (1.2%), ovarian conservation is not negatively associated with endometrial cancer-related or all-cause mortality in young women with early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer. Despite this, utilization of ovarian conservation for young women with early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer remains modest with only a gradual increase in uptake in the United States. We propose a framework and strategic approach to identify young women with early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer who may be candidates for ovarian conservation. This evidence-based schema consists of a 2-step assessment at both the preoperative and intraoperative stages that can be universally integrated into practice.", "Keywords": ["endometrial cancer", "ovarian conservation", "proposal", "review"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Carcinoma, Endometrioid", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Female", "Fertility Preservation", "Humans", "Hysterectomy", "Menopause", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm Staging", "Organ Sparing Treatments", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Ovariectomy", "Perioperative Care", "Risk Assessment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Matsuo", "Affiliation": "Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.

COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our ability to provide timely surgical care for our patients. In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand. The purpose of this white paper is to highlight all phases of gynecologic cancer surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate when it is best to operate, to hestitate, and reintegrate surgery. Triage and prioritization of surgical cases, preoperative COVID-19 testing, peri-operative safety principles, and preparations for the post-COVID-19 peak and surgical reintegration are reviewed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Testing", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Coronavirus Infections", "Decision Making", "Female", "Genital Neoplasms, Female", "Gynecologic Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "Surgical Oncology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda N", "Last Name": "Fader", "Affiliation": "Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.

The majority of accidental pediatric head trauma is minor and sustained without intracranial injury. Well-validated pediatric-specific clinical decision guidelines should be used to identify very low-risk children who can safely forgo imaging. In those who require acute imaging, CT is considered the first-line imaging modality for suspected intracranial injury because of the short duration of the examination and its high sensitivity for acute hemorrhage. MRI can accurately detect traumatic complications, but often necessitates sedation in children, owing to the examination length and motion sensitivity, which limits rapid assessment. There is a paucity of literature regarding vascular injuries in pediatric blunt head trauma and imaging is typically guided by clinical suspicion. Advanced imaging techniques have the potential to identify changes that are not seen by standard imaging, but data are currently insufficient to support routine clinical use. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.", "Keywords": ["AUC", "Appropriate Use Criteria", "Appropriateness Criteria", "CT", "Head trauma", "MRI", "Pediatric"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Contrast Media", "Craniocerebral Trauma", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Societies, Medical", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Expert Panel on Pediatric Imaging", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maura E", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Ann & Robert H.

Hypertension is associated with poor maternal outcomes, including stroke. Disparities in hypertension might contribute to maternal strokes. Methods and Results Using billing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample, we analyzed the effect of race/ethnicity on stroke during delivery admission in women aged 18 to 54 years delivering in US hospitals from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2014. We categorized hypertension as normotensive, chronic hypertension, or pregnancy-induced hypertension. Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using log-linear Poisson regression models, testing for interactions between race/ethnicity and hypertensive status. A total of 65\u00a0286\u00a0425 women were admitted for delivery during the study period, of whom 7764 were diagnosed with a stroke (11.9 per 100\u00a0000 deliveries). Hypertension modified the effect of race/ethnicity (P<0.0001 for interaction). Among women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, black and Hispanic women had higher stroke risk compared with non-Hispanic whites (blacks: aRR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.86-2.30; Hispanics: aRR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.98-2.43). Among women with chronic hypertension, all minority women had higher stroke risk (blacks: aRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.30-2.26; Hispanics: aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63; Asian/Pacific Islanders: aRR, 3.62; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63). Among normotensive women, only blacks had increased stroke risk (aRR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28). Conclusions Pregnant US women from minority groups had higher stroke risk during delivery admissions, compared with non-Hispanic whites.

We sought to determine the frequency and predictors of MDC and assess the association between MDC and nationally-recognized quality metrics in patients with breast cancer. Methods: We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare dataset to evaluate patients diagnosed with stages I-III breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery between 2002 and 2011 with follow-up to 2012. We defined MDC as a visit claim from a surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist within 12\u00a0months of diagnosis. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine the association between demographic and clinical variables and MDC, and to assess the association between MDC and three nationally-recognized quality indicators (adjuvant hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors, chemotherapy for hormone receptor-negative cancer, and radiation after lumpectomy). Results: Of the 61,039 patients in our initial cohort, 53,849 (88.2%) saw a medical oncologist, 46,521 (76.2%) saw a radiation oncologist, and 43,280 (70.9%) were evaluated by all three providers the first year after diagnosis. MDC use was higher in patients with the highest socioeconomic status compared with the lowest [odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% CI 1.63-1.86], in patients diagnosed in later\u00a0years, and those with stage III disease compared to stage I [OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.41]. Patients older in age (\u226580 vs. 65-69\u00a0years, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.34), patients with more comorbidities, those who lived in a rural setting compared to urban (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.57-0.64), and unmarried patients (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.82) were less likely to see all three providers. In a multivariable analysis, MDC use was associated with increased likelihood of meeting each quality metric. Conclusion: Early stage breast cancer patients were evaluated by a surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist less than 75% of the time. Enhanced coordination of care and navigation programs may improve the quality of care delivered.", "Keywords": ["Breast cancer", "SEER-Medicare", "multidisciplinary care", "quality indicators"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cohort Studies", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Neoplasm Staging", "Odds Ratio", "Oncologists", "Radiotherapy, Adjuvant", "Referral and Consultation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Farah F", "Last Name": "Quyyumi", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "b Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa K", "Last Name": "Accordino", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Buono", "Affiliation": "d Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia W", "Last Name": "Law", "Affiliation": "d Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Grace C", "Last Name": "Hillyer", "Affiliation": "b Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Alfred I", "Last Name": "Neugut", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York , USA."}], "Journal": "Cancer investigation", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31279493", "Title": "Effectiveness of postoperative chemotherapy for stage IC mucinous ovarian cancer.", "Abstract": "To examine the association between postoperative chemotherapy and survival of women with stage IC mucinous ovarian cancer (MOC).", "Keywords": ["Mucinous ovarian cancer", "Postoperative chemotherapy", "Stage IC", "Survival", "Trend"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Postoperative Care", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Matsuo", "Affiliation": "Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Among uterine cancer (n = 246,272) and colorectal cancer (n = 421,312) cohorts, women with both diagnoses were identified, and clinico-pathological factors and survival were extracted and analyzed. There were 6862 women with both cancer diagnoses, representing 2.8% of the uterine cancer cohort and 1.6% of the colorectal cancer cohort. Among 123,940 women with uterine cancer survivors, the number with postcedent colorectal cancer decreased from 5.3% to 0.7% between 1981-2008 (relative risk reduction 87.0% p < 0.001). Similarly, of 141,801 women with colorectal cancer survivors, the number with postcedent uterine cancer decreased from 1.7% to 0.5% between 1973-2008 (relative risk reduction 71.6%, p < 0.001). In the uterine cancer cohort, women with antecedent/synchronous colorectal cancer had more high-grade tumors and advanced-stage disease resulting in poorer survival, whereas those who had postcedent colorectal cancer had more low-grade tumors and early-stage disease resulting in superior survival compared to those without secondary colorectal cancer (all, p < 0.05).

Objective: The purpose was to determine how preference for LEC at the EoL for advanced cancer patients varied by Latino ethnicity and immigrant status, and over time between two large cohorts. Methods: Data were derived from two sequential multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort studies of advanced cancer patients, recruited from 2002 to 2008 (coping with cancer I [CwC-1]) and 2010 to 2015 (coping with cancer II [CwC-2]). Self-reported U.S.-born whites (whites) (N\u2009=\u2009253), U.S.-born Latinos (US-L) (N\u2009=\u200934), and Latino immigrants (LI) (N\u2009=\u200965) with a poor-prognosis cancer were included. The primary independent variables were immigrant status, Latino ethnicity, and CwC cohort. The primary dependent variable was preference for LEC. Results: Within CwC-2, LI were 9.4 times more likely to prefer LEC over comfort care versus US-L (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u2009=\u20099.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-72.4), and US-L were 0.3 times less likely to prefer LEC versus whites (AOR\u2009=\u20090.3; 95% CI: 0.1-1.0). LI from CwC-2 were 11.4 times more likely to prefer LEC versus LI from CwC-1 (AOR\u2009=\u200911.4; 95% CI: 2.7-48.4).

Obstetric, medical, demographic, and hospital factors including PPH during the index delivery were analyzed. Sixty-day postpartum readmission for PPH was the primary outcome. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed. In adjusted models, the risk was characterized as adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). As a secondary outcome to further characterize how PPH at delivery was associated with readmission likelihood, the risk for all-cause readmission was evaluated among women with this diagnosis during their delivery.Results: Of the 15,701,150 delivery hospitalizations, 10,618 women were readmitted postpartum for a primary indication of postpartum hemorrhage. Eighty-two percent of readmissions occurred \u226420 days after discharge. In the adjusted model for readmission for PPH, PPH during the delivery hospitalization was associated with aRR of 5.26 (95% CI 4.94, 5.59) for hemorrhage alone, aRR of 14.28 (95% CI 13.06, 15.60) for hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and aRR of 12.40 for PPH with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) requiring transfusion (95% CI 9.56-16.08) compared to no PPH. For the secondary analysis evaluating all-cause readmission, PPH during delivery was associated with aRR of 1.47 for PPH alone (95% CI 1.44-1.51), aRR of 2.43 for PPH requiring transfusion (95% CI 2.34-2.52), and aRR of 2.77 for PPH with DIC requiring transfusion (95% CI 2.54-3.03) compared to no PPH.Conclusion: PPH at delivery is a significant risk factor for subsequent readmission both for PPH and for all causes.

These observational studies are often feasible when randomized trial may not be, and may be more generalizable than randomized trials, because of greater diversity in the study populations. While statistical methods such as multivariable regression, matching, stratification, and weighting can adjust for the confounding in observational studies, statistical adjustment cannot control for confounders that are unmeasured in the data. Observational studies comparing the effectiveness of treatments for gynecologic malignancies are susceptible to bias from unmeasured confounding because factors like functional status, frailty and disease burden, which influence treatment selection and outcome, are often not reported in existing data sources. Like randomized trials, quasi-experimental designs attempt to account for both measured and unmeasured confounding by exploiting natural experiments arising in the real world. These methods are underutilized in gynecologic oncology research and are particularly relevant to studies that use large datasets to study the effectiveness of treatments.

The objective of this study was to evaluate risk for 60-day hypertension-related postpartum readmission based on length of stay after delivery.Methods: The 2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's (HCUP) Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to analyze risk for readmission for a hypertension-related diagnosis within 60 days from cesarean delivery hospitalization for women with preeclampsia who underwent cesarean delivery. Risk for readmission was evaluated based on postoperative length of stay as well as demographic, hospital, and other obstetric factors. Population weights were applied to create national estimates. Multivariable analyses were performed with adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals as measures of effect. Mean and median hospital charges based upon postoperative length of stay were also evaluated. Time from delivery hospitalization to readmission was calculated.Results: In 2014, 65 401 women with preeclampsia underwent cesarean delivery. Of these, 1016 women (1.6%) were readmitted for a hypertension-related diagnosis. 921 of the 1016 readmissions occurred within 10 days of discharge (90.6%). In adjusted analyses, postoperative LOS 5-7 days and >7 days compared to LOS <3 days were associated with decreased risk of 60-day hypertension-related readmission (aRR 0.59 95% CI 0.45, 0.78; aRR 0.53 95% CI 0.29, 1.00, respectively). When the cohort was restricted to women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, LOS 5-7 days was associated with decreased risk of 60-day hypertension-related readmission in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses compared to LOS <3 days (risk ratios (RR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.18, 0.65; aRR 0.29, 95% 0.18, 0.46, respectively). Median delivery hospitalization charges were $26 512. Compared to LOS <3 days, mean and median charges increased significantly for patients with LOS 4, 5-7, and >7 days.Conclusion: Longer postoperative length of stay during cesarean delivery hospitalizations was associated with decreased risk for postpartum hypertension-related readmission. Most readmissions occurred soon after discharge.

When compared to endometrial cancer without synchronous ovarian cancer, endometrioid histology in the two cancer sites was associated with improved cause-specific survival while non-endometrioid histology in the ovarian cancer was associated with decreased cause-specific survival (adjusted-P<0.01).

However, the association of cardiovascular-disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) with long-term survival and cardiac events is not well studied. Methods We examined SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) breast cancer trials from 1999 to 2011. We identified baseline diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease by linking trial records to Medicare claims. The primary outcome was overall survival. Patients with both baseline and follow-up claims were examined for cardiac events. Cox regression was used to assess the association between CVD-RFs and outcomes. Results We identified 1,460 participants older than 66 years of age from five trials; 842 were eligible for survival outcomes analysis. At baseline, median age was 70 years, and median follow-up was 6 years. Hypertension (73%) and hypercholesterolemia (57%) were the most prevalent conditions; 87% of patients had one or more CVD-RF. There was no association between any of the individual CVD-RFs and overall survival except for hypercholesterolemia, which was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P = .01). With each additional CVD-RF, there was an increased risk of death (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.40; P = .002), worse progression-free survival (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.25; P = .05), and marginally worse cancer-free survival (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.34; P = .07). The relationship between baseline CVD-RFs and cardiac events was analyzed in 736 patients. A strong linear association between the number of CVD-RFs and cardiac event was observed (HR per CVD-RF, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.69; P < .001). Conclusion Among participants in clinical trials, each additional baseline CVD-RF was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events and death. Efforts to improve control of modifiable CVD-RFs are needed, especially among those with multiple risk factors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "Dawn L.

Our objective was to determine if mFI predicts morbidity and mortality in the diverse national cohort of patients undergoing neurosurgery for intracranial neoplasms. We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients.

Later trials have shown the feasibility of using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) instead. But vaginal movement between fractions is concerning when using IMRT due to greater conformality of the isodose curves to the target and the resulting possibility of missing the target while the vagina is displaced. In this study, we showed that the use of a rectal balloon during treatment can decrease vaginal displacement, limit rectal dose, and limit acute and late toxicities. Little is known regarding the use of a rectal balloon (RB) in treating patients with IMRT in the posthysterectomy setting. We hypothesize that the use of an RB during treatment can limit rectal dose and acute and long-term toxicities, as well as decrease vaginal cuff displacement between fractions. We performed a retrospective review of patients with gynecological malignancies who received postoperative IMRT with the use of an RB from January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2015. Rectal dose constraint was examined as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 1203 and 0418. Daily cone beam computed tomography (CT) was performed, and the average (avg) displacement, avg magnitude, and avg magnitude of vector were calculated. Toxicity was reported according to RTOG acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Acute toxicity was defined as less than 90 days from the end of radiation treatment. Late toxicity was defined as at least 90 days after completing radiation. Twenty-eight patients with postoperative IMRT with the use of an RB were examined and 23 treatment plans were reviewed. The avg rectal V40 was 39.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0%. V30 was65.1%\u2009\u00b1\u200910.0%. V50 was 0%. Separate cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images (n = 663) were reviewed. The avg displacement was as follows: superior 0.4\u2009+\u20092.99\u2009mm, left 0.23\u2009\u00b1\u20094.97\u2009mm, and anterior 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20095.18\u2009mm. The avg magnitude of displacement was superior/inferior 2.22\u2009\u00b1\u20092.04\u2009mm, laterally 3.41\u2009\u00b1\u20093.62\u2009mm, and anterior/posterior 3.86\u2009\u00b1\u20093.45\u2009mm. The avg vector magnitude was 6.60\u2009\u00b1\u20094.14\u2009mm. For acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, 50% experienced grade 1 toxicities and 18% grade 2 GI toxicities. For acute genitourinary (GU) toxicities, 21% had grade 1 and 18% had grade 2 toxicities. For late GU toxicities, 7% had grade 1 and 4% had grade 2 toxicities.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunophenotype and possible histogenesis of carcinosarcomas of the uterus. Sixty-two cases of uterine carcinosarcomas diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 were retrieved from the gynecologic pathology files at Columbia University Medical Center. Representative tissue blocks containing both epithelial and mesenchymal components were selected from each case for histologic and immunohistochemical studies. Clinical data from each case were retrieved. The epithelial component was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the majority (80.7%) of cases; in 17.7%, the carcinoma was moderately differentiated, and in only 1.6% the carcinoma was well differentiated. 53% of the tumors had homologous stromal elements and 47% displayed heterologous stromal elements. Immunohistochemical study revealed almost equal staining in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of carcinosarcomas for p16 and p53. PAX8 positivity was noted in 73% of epithelial components, but only 13% of stromal components, and PAX8 stromal positivity was never seen in the absence of PAX8 epithelial positivity.
