[{"PMID": "38328122", "Title": "Human vascular organoids with a mosaic AKT1 mutation recapitulate Proteus syndrome.", "Abstract": "Vascular malformation, a key clinical phenotype of Proteus syndrome, lacks effective models for pathophysiological study and drug development due to limited patient sample access. To bridge this gap, we built a human vascular organoid model replicating Proteus syndrome's vasculature. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gene overexpression, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embodying the Proteus syndrome-specific AKTE17K point mutation for organoid generation. Our findings revealed that AKT overactivation in these organoids resulted in smaller sizes yet increased vascular connectivity, although with less stable connections. This could be due to the significant vasculogenesis induced by AKT overactivation. This phenomenon likely stems from boosted vasculogenesis triggered by AKT overactivation, leading to increased vascular sprouting. Additionally, a notable increase in dysfunctional PDGFR\u03b2+ mural cells, impaired in matrix secretion, was observed in these AKT-overactivated organoids. The application of AKT inhibitors (ARQ092, AZD5363, or GDC0068) reversed the vascular malformations; the inhibitors' effectiveness was directly linked to reduced connectivity in the organoids. In summary, our study introduces an innovative in vitro model combining organoid technology and gene editing to explore vascular pathophysiology in Proteus syndrome. This model not only simulates Proteus syndrome vasculature but also holds potential for mimicking vasculatures of other genetically driven diseases. It represents an advance in drug development for rare diseases, historically plagued by slow progress.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Siyu", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuefei", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shradha", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel Naveed", "Last Name": "Tavakol", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jong Ha", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rayna Batya-Leia", "Last Name": "Berris", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jounghyun H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caleb", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shannon", "Last Name": "McElroy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raju", "Last Name": "Tomer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elham", "Last Name": "Azizi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yeh-Hsing", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan27"}, {"PMID": "38300958", "Title": "Cellular arrangement impacts metabolic activity and antibiotic tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.", "Abstract": "Cells must access resources to survive, and the anatomy of multicellular structures influences this access.

The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus.

Here, we present a monolithic complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) multi-clamp amplifier integrated circuit capable of recording both voltages and currents with performance exceeding that of commercial benchtop instrumentation. Miniaturization enables high-bandwidth current mirroring, facilitating the synthesis of large-valued active resistors with lower noise than their passive equivalents. This enables the realization of compensation modules that can account for a wide range of electrode impedances.

We distinguished 62 neuronal subtypes producing glutamatergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic markers for synaptic neurotransmission and harboring the ability to engage in task-dependent neurotransmitter switching. We identified dopamine neurons that uniquely coexpress the Onecut3 and Nmur2 genes, and placed these in the periventricular nucleus with many synaptic afferents arising from neuromedin S+ neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These neuroendocrine dopamine cells may contribute to the dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin secretion diurnally, as their neuromedin S+ inputs originate from neurons expressing Per2 and Per3 and their tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation is regulated in a circadian fashion.

Here, using an array of intact-brain circuit interrogation tools, including CLARITY, COLM, optogenetics, viral tracing, and fiber photometry, we explore the diversity of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We identify two parallel nigrostriatal dopamine neuron subpopulations differing in biophysical properties, input wiring, output wiring to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) versus dorsolateral striatum (DLS), and natural activity patterns during free behavior. Our results reveal independently operating nigrostriatal information streams, with implications for understanding the logic of dopaminergic feedback circuits and the diversity of mammalian neuronal cell types.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Dopamine", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Pathways", "Neurons", "Reward", "Shock", "Substantia Nigra"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Talia N", "Last Name": "Lerner", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "Shilyansky", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin T", "Last Name": "Beier", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Zalocusky", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Neuroscience Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ailey K", "Last Name": "Crow", "Affiliation": "CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Malenka", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liqun", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raju", "Last Name": "Tomer", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karl", "Last Name": "Deisseroth", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; CNC Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Moreover, it has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate information about the spatial dependence between cells within the tissue under study. When such information exists it provides important insights that should be directly included in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored cell types within the brain of this important model system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cluster Analysis", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Factual", "Gene Expression Profiling", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Markov Chains", "Polychaeta", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jean-Baptiste", "Last Name": "Pettit", "Affiliation": "European Bioinformatics Institute-European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Raju", "Last Name": "Tomer", "Affiliation": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kaia", "Last Name": "Achim", "Affiliation": "Developmental Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sylvia", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "MRC Biostatistics Unit (MRC BSU), Cambridge Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Lamiae", "Last Name": "Azizi", "Affiliation": "MRC Biostatistics Unit (MRC BSU), Cambridge Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Marioni", "Affiliation": "European Bioinformatics Institute-European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2014Sep"}, {"PMID": "25214631", "Title": "Development of the annelid axochord: insights into notochord evolution.", "Abstract": "The origin of chordates has been debated for more than a century, with one key issue being the emergence of the notochord.

We identify a population of mesodermal cells in a developing invertebrate, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, that converges and extends toward the midline and expresses a notochord-specific combination of genes. These cells differentiate into a longitudinal muscle, the axochord, that is positioned between central nervous system and axial blood vessel and secretes a strong collagenous extracellular matrix.

To date, NECABs have been explored only to a limited extent and, so far, not at all at the spinal level. Here, we describe the distribution, phenotype, and nerve injury-induced regulation of NECAB1/NECAB2 in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord. In DRGs, NECAB1/2 are expressed in around 70% of mainly small- and medium-sized neurons. Many colocalize with calcitonin gene-related peptide and isolectin B4, and thus represent nociceptors. NECAB1/2 neurons are much more abundant in DRGs than the Ca(2+)-binding proteins (parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and secretagogin) studied to date. In the spinal cord, the NECAB1/2 distribution is mainly complementary. NECAB1 labels interneurons and a plexus of processes in superficial layers of the dorsal horn, commissural neurons in the intermediate area, and motor neurons in the ventral horn. Using CLARITY, a novel, bilaterally connected neuronal system with dendrites that embrace the dorsal columns like palisades is observed. NECAB2 is present in cell bodies and presynaptic boutons across the spinal cord. In the dorsal horn, most NECAB1/2 neurons are glutamatergic. Both NECAB1/2 are transported into dorsal roots and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerve injury reduces NECAB2, but not NECAB1, expression in DRG neurons.
