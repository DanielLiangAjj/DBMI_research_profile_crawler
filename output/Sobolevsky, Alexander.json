Deciphering ion channel mechanisms, however, requires understanding the ensemble dynamics beyond the static structures. Here, we present a molecular modeling-based approach characterizing the ion channel structural intermediates, or their \"dynamic molecular portraits\", by assessing water and ion conductivity along with the detailed evaluation of pore hydrophobicity and residue packing. We illustrate the power of this approach by analyzing structures of few vanilloid-subfamily transient receptor potential (TRPV) channels. Based on the pore architecture, there are three major states that are common for TRPVs, which we call \u03b1-closed, \u03c0-closed, and \u03c0-open. We show that the pore hydrophobicity and residue packing for the open state is most favorable for the pore conductance. On the contrary, the \u03b1-closed state is the most hydrophobic and always non-conducting. Our approach can also be used for structural and functional classification of ion channels.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yury A", "Last Name": "Trofimov", "Affiliation": "Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"First Name": "Nikolay A", "Last Name": "Krylov", "Affiliation": "Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"First Name": "Alexander S", "Last Name": "Minakov", "Affiliation": "M.V.

Vanilloid (V) subfamily is the most studied category of TRP channels that includes six closely related members: highly calcium-selective TRPV5-6 and non-selective TRPV1-4. A remarkable feature of TRPV1-4 is their ability to sense heat, which makes them temperature-sensitive TRP channels or thermo-TRPs. TRPV channels are associated with a multitude of human diseases, including cancers, chronic pain, cardiovascular, neurological and nociceptive disorders. Despite the great clinical interest, pharmacology of TRPV channels remains largely undeveloped because of insufficient knowledge about the mechanisms of their regulation. For instance, activation of TRPV channels by small molecules or heat remains poorly understood. Numerous identified TRPV channel agonists, while effective in physiological experiments, appear limited in their ability to act in the conditions of structural biology experiments.

An ionic current through a single iGluR channel shows up to four discrete conductance levels (O1-O4)4-6. Higher conductance levels have been associated with an increased number of agonist molecules bound to four individual ligand-binding domains (LBDs)6-10. Here we determine structures of a synaptic complex of AMPA-subtype iGluR and the auxiliary subunit \u03b32 in non-desensitizing conditions with various occupancy of the LBDs by glutamate.

Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine-learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. Conversely, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee maximal channel conductance and favours subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally.

These ligand-gated ion channels are critical to brain function and are centrally implicated in numerous psychiatric and neurologic disorders. There are different classes of iGluRs with a variety of receptor subtypes in each class that play distinct roles in neuronal functions. The diversity in iGluR subtypes, with their unique functional properties and physiologic roles, has motivated a large number of studies. Our understanding of receptor subtypes has advanced considerably since the first iGluR subunit gene was cloned in 1989, and the research focus has expanded to encompass facets of biology that have been recently discovered and to exploit experimental paradigms made possible by technological advances. Here, we review insights from more than 3 decades of iGluR studies with an emphasis on the progress that has occurred in the past decade. We cover structure, function, pharmacology, roles in neurophysiology, and therapeutic implications for all classes of receptors assembled from the subunits encoded by the 18 ionotropic glutamate receptor genes.

TRPV6 inhibitors are needed for the treatment of a broad range of diseases associated with disturbed calcium homeostasis, including cancers. Here we combine cryo-EM, calcium imaging, and mutagenesis to explore molecular bases of human TRPV6 inhibition by the antifungal drug econazole and the universal ion channel blocker ruthenium red (RR). Econazole binds to an allosteric site at the channel's periphery, where it replaces a lipid. In contrast, RR inhibits TRPV6 by binding in the middle of the ion channel's selectivity filter and plugging its pore like a bottle cork. Despite different binding site locations, both inhibitors induce similar conformational changes in the channel resulting in closure of the gate formed by S6 helices bundle crossing. The uncovered molecular mechanisms of TRPV6 inhibition can guide the design of a new generation of clinically useful inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antifungal Agents", "Binding Sites", "Calcium", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Calcium Channels", "Econazole", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Ruthenium Red", "TRPV Cation Channels"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Neuberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kirill D", "Last Name": "Nadezhdin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander I", "Last Name": "Sobolevsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. as4005@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2021Nov01"}, {"PMID": "34678168", "Title": "Structure and desensitization of AMPA receptor complexes with type II TARP \u03b35 and GSG1L.", "Abstract": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Their surface expression, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology are regulated by auxiliary subunits. Of the two types of TARP auxiliary subunits, type I TARPs assume activating roles, while type II TARPs serve suppressive functions. We present cryo-EM structures of GluA2 AMPAR in complex with type II TARP \u03b35, which reduces steady-state currents, increases single-channel conductance, and slows recovery from desensitization. Regulation of AMPAR function depends on its ligand-binding domain (LBD) interaction with the \u03b35 head domain. GluA2-\u03b35 complex shows maximum stoichiometry of two TARPs per AMPAR tetramer, being different from type I TARPs but reminiscent of the auxiliary subunit GSG1L. Desensitization of both GluA2-GSG1L and GluA2-\u03b35 complexes is accompanied by rupture of LBD dimer interface, while GluA2-\u03b35 but not GluA2-GSG1L LBD dimers remain two-fold symmetric.

In this review, we describe the molecular structure of TRPV6 and discuss how its structural elements define its unique functional properties. High Ca2+ selectivity of TRPV6 originates from the narrow selectivity filter, where Ca2+ ions are directly coordinated by a ring of anionic aspartate side chains. Divalent cations Ca2+ and Ba2+ permeate TRPV6 pore according to the knock-off mechanism, while tight binding of Gd3+ to the aspartate ring blocks the channel and prevents Na+ from permeating the pore. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an \u03b1-to-\u03c0 helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6. As a result of this transition, the intracellular halves of the S6 helices bend and rotate by about 100\u00a0deg, exposing different residues to the channel pore in the open and closed states. Channel opening is also associated with changes in occupancy of the transmembrane domain lipid binding sites. The inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) binds to TRPV6 in a pocket formed by the cytoplasmic half of the S1-S4 transmembrane helical bundle and shifts open-closed channel equilibrium towards the closed state by outcompeting lipids critical for activation. Ca2+ inhibits TRPV6 via binding to calmodulin (CaM), which mediates Ca2+ -dependent inactivation. The TRPV6-CaM complex exhibits 1:1 stoichiometry; one TRPV6 tetramer binds both CaM lobes, which adopt a distinct head-to-tail arrangement. The CaM C-terminal lobe plugs the channel through a unique cation-\u03c0 interaction by inserting the side chain of lysine K115 into a tetra-tryptophan cage at the ion channel pore intracellular entrance.
