The transcriptionally active somatic genome, contained within the physically larger macronucleus, is both structurally and functionally different from the silent germline genome housed in the smaller micronucleus. This difference in genome architecture is particularly exaggerated in Oxytricha trifallax, in which the somatic genome comprises tens of thousands of gene-sized nanochromosomes maintained at a high and variable ploidy, while the germline has a diploid set of megabase-scale chromosomes. To examine the compositional differences between the nuclear structures housing the genomes, we performed a proteomic survey of both types of nuclei and of macronuclear histones using quantitative mass spectrometry. We note distinct differences between the somatic and germline nuclei, with many functional proteins being highly enriched in one of the two nuclei. To validate our conclusions and the efficacy of nuclear separation, we used protein localization through a combination of transformations and immunofluorescence. We also note that the macronuclear histones strikingly display only activating marks, consistent with the conclusion that the macronucleus is the hub of transcription.

This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for Euplotes woodruffi, Tetmemena sp., and the model ciliate O. trifallax. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of E. woodruffi, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of Tetmemena sp. We find that the germline genome of Tetmemena is as massively scrambled and interrupted as Oxytricha's: 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier diverged spirotrich, E. woodruffi, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of Euplotes as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions.

Although many high-quality somatic genomes have been assembled, a high-quality germline genome assembly is difficult to obtain due to its smaller DNA content and abundance of repetitive sequences. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a new pipeline, SIGAR (Split-read Inference of Genome Architecture and Rearrangements) to infer germline genome architecture and rearrangement features without a germline genome assembly, requiring only short DNA sequencing reads. As a proof of principle, 93% of rearrangement junctions identified by SIGAR in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax were validated by the existing germline assembly. We then applied SIGAR to six diverse ciliate species without germline genome assemblies, including Ichthyophthirius multifilii, a fish pathogen.

After applying these methods to the chromosome rearrangement maps of O. trifallax we describe cases of nested arrangements with up to five layers of embedded genes, as well as the most scrambled loci in O. trifallax.", "Keywords": ["Ciliates", "Genome rearrangement", "Nanochromosomes", "Nested genes", "Scrambled genes"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosomes", "DNA", "Gene Rearrangement", "Genetic Loci", "Macronucleus", "Micronucleus, Germline", "Oxytricha", "Recombination, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jasper", "Last Name": "Braun", "Affiliation": "University of South Florida; Department of Mathematics and Statistics."}, {"First Name": "Lukas", "Last Name": "Nabergall", "Affiliation": "University of South Florida; Department of Mathematics and Statistics."}, {"First Name": "Rafik", "Last Name": "Neme", "Affiliation": "Columbia University; Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Biological Sciences."}, {"First Name": "Laura F", "Last Name": "Landweber", "Affiliation": "Columbia University; Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Biological Sciences Laura.Landweber@columbia.edu jonoska@mail.usf.edu."}, {"First Name": "Masahico", "Last Name": "Saito", "Affiliation": "University of South Florida; Department of Mathematics and Statistics."}, {"First Name": "Nata\u0161a", "Last Name": "Jonoska", "Affiliation": "University of South Florida; Department of Mathematics and Statistics Laura.Landweber@columbia.edu jonoska@mail.usf.edu."}], "Journal": "G3 (Bethesda, Md.)", "PubDate": "2018May04"}, {"PMID": "29079634", "Title": "Small RNA-mediated regulation of DNA dosage in the ciliate Oxytricha.", "Abstract": "Dicer-dependent small noncoding RNAs play important roles in gene regulation in a wide variety of organisms. Endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are part of an ancient pathway of transposon control in plants and animals. The ciliate, Oxytricha trifallax, has approximately 16,000 gene-sized chromosomes in its somatic nucleus. Long noncoding RNAs establish high ploidy levels at the onset of sexual development, but the factors that regulate chromosome copy numbers during cell division and growth have been a mystery. We report a novel function of a class of Dicer (Dcl-1)- and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-dependent endogenous small RNAs in regulating chromosome copy number and gene dosage in O. trifallax Asexually growing populations express an abundant class of 21-nt sRNAs that map to both coding and noncoding regions of most chromosomes. These sRNAs are bound to chromatin and their levels surprisingly do not correlate with mRNA levels. Instead, the levels of these small RNAs correlate with genomic DNA copy number. Reduced sRNA levels in dcl-1 or rdrp mutants lead to concomitant reduction in chromosome copy number. Furthermore, these cells show no signs of transposon activation, but instead display irregular nuclear architecture and signs of replication stress. In conclusion, Oxytricha Dcl-1 and RdRP-dependent small RNAs that derive from the somatic nucleus contribute to the maintenance of gene dosage, possibly via a role in DNA replication, offering a novel role for these small RNAs in eukaryotes.", "Keywords": ["DNA copy number", "Dicer", "ciliates", "epigenetics", "small RNAs"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosomes", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "DNA Replication", "DNA, Protozoan", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Oxytricha", "Protozoan Proteins", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA, Protozoan", "RNA, Small Untranslated", "Ribonuclease III"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaspreet S", "Last Name": "Khurana", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Derek M", "Last Name": "Clay", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandrine", "Last Name": "Moreira", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura F", "Last Name": "Landweber", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA Laura.Landweber@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "RNA (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2018Jan"}, {"PMID": "28662661", "Title": "Non-model model organisms.", "Abstract": "Model organisms are widely used in research as accessible and convenient systems to study a particular area or question in biology.

A common feature of these ciliates is the presence of two types of nuclei: a germline micronucleus and a transcriptionally-active somatic macronucleus containing over 16,000 gene sized \"nano-chromosomes\". During conjugation the old parental macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus forms from a copy of the zygotic micronucleus. During this process, macronuclear chromosomes assemble through DNA processing events that delete 90-98% of the DNA content of the micronucleus. This includes the deletion of noncoding DNA segments that interrupt precursor DNA regions in the micronucleus, as well as transposons and other germline-limited DNA. Each macronuclear locus may be present in the micronucleus as several nonconsecutive, permuted, and/or inverted DNA segments. Here we investigate the genome-wide range of scrambled gene architectures that describe all precursor-product relationships in Oxytricha trifallax, the first completely sequenced scrambled genome. We find that five general, recurrent patterns in the sets of scrambled micronuclear precursor pieces can describe over 80% of Oxytricha's scrambled genes. These include instances of translocations and inversions, and other specific patterns characterized by alternating stretches of consecutive odd and even DNA segments. Moreover, we find that iterating patterns of alternating odd-even segments up to four times can describe over 96% of the scrambled precursor loci.

This developmental process provides a powerful model system to directly test the influence of small noncoding RNAs on chromosome fusion events during somatic differentiation. Here we show that small RNAs are capable of inducing chromosome fusions in 4 distinct cases (out of 4 tested), including one fusion of 3 chromosomes. We further show that these RNA-mediated chromosome fusions are heritable over multiple sexual generations and that transmission of the acquired fusion is associated with endogenous production of novel piRNA molecules that target the fused junction.

An information theoretical analysis of protein structures supports the hypothesis that the TIM barrel architecture could arise more easily by duplication and recombination compared to other mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structures. We show that TIM barrel enzymes corresponding to the most taxonomically broad superfamilies also have the broadest range of functions, often aided by metal and nucleotide-derived cofactors that are thought to reflect an earlier stage of metabolic evolution. By comparison to other putatively ancient protein architectures, we find that the functional diversity of TIM barrel proteins cannot be explained simply by their antiquity. Instead, the breadth of TIM barrel functions can be explained, in part, by the incorporation of a broad range of cofactors, a trend that does not appear to be shared by proteins in general.

This process eliminates noncoding sequences that interrupt coding regions in the germline genome, and joins over 225,000 remaining DNA segments, some of which require inversion or complex permutation to build functional genes. This dynamic genomic organization permits some single DNA segments in the germline to contribute to multiple, distinct somatic genes via alternative processing. Like alternative mRNA splicing, the combinatorial assembly of DNA segments contributes to genetic variation and facilitates the evolution of new genes. In this study, we use comparative genomic analysis to demonstrate that the emergence of alternative DNA splicing is associated with the origin of new genes. Short duplications give rise to alternative gene segments that are spliced to the shared gene segments. Alternative gene segments evolve faster than shared, constitutive segments. Genes with shared segments frequently have different expression profiles, permitting functional divergence.

Here we show that such RNAs are bidirectionally transcribed and transported to the zygotic nucleus. The gene encoding the second-largest subunit of Pol-II, Rpb2, has undergone gene duplication, and the two paralogs, Rpb2-a and -b, display different expression patterns. Immunoprecipitation of double-stranded RNAs identified an association with Rpb2-a. Through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show that Rpb2-a in early zygotes appears surprisingly unassociated with other Pol II subunits. A partial loss of function of Rpb2-a leads to an increase in expression of transposons and other germline-limited satellite repeats.

The tiny macronuclear \"nanochromosomes\" typically encode single, protein-coding genes (a small portion, 10%, encode 2-8 genes), have minimal noncoding regions, and are differentially amplified to an average of \u223c2,000 copies. We report the high-quality genome assembly of \u223c16,000 complete nanochromosomes (\u223c50 Mb haploid genome size) that vary from 469 bp to 66 kb long (mean \u223c3.2 kb) and encode \u223c18,500 genes.
