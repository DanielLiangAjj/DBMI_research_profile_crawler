Saliva was collected from 5 women in the first and 14 women in the third trimesters of pregnancy and analyzed at two different sites, at one using nested PCR and at the other using quantitative PCR (qPCR). No VZV DNA was detected at either site in the saliva of women during the first trimester; however, VZV DNA was detected in the majority of samples of saliva (11/12 examined by nested PCR; 7/10 examined by qPCR) during the third trimester.

One and two dose schedules are highly effective against varicella and large reductions in disease incidence, particularly moderate-severe disease, have been widely reported. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the introduction of varicella vaccination results in a shift of varicella disease burden to older age groups.

We report the development of arm paralysis after varicella vaccination in a 1-year-old child. Paralysis was initially presumed to be due to vOka because of the temporal relationship between vaccination and onset of arm weakness; however, molecular studies identified wild-type varicella zoster virus VZV (WT-VZV) in the CSF, leading the authors to conclude that WT-VZV was the probable cause.

We show that the attenuated virus evolves rapidly (\u223c 10(-6) substitutions/site/day), but that rates decrease dramatically when the virus undergoes latency. These data are best explained by a model in which viral populations evolve for around 13 days before becoming latent, but then undergo no replication during latency.

Primary infection is followed by latency in ganglionic neurons. During this period, no virus particles are produced and no obvious neuronal damage occurs. Reactivation of the virus leads to virus replication, which causes zoster (shingles) in tissues innervated by the involved neurons, inflammation and cell death - a process that can lead to persistent radicular pain (postherpetic neuralgia). The pathogenesis of postherpetic neuralgia is unknown and it is difficult to treat. Furthermore, other zoster complications can develop, including myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, stroke (vasculopathy), retinitis, and gastroenterological infections such as ulcers, pancreatitis and hepatitis. VZV is the only human herpesvirus for which highly effective vaccines are available. After varicella or vaccination, both wild-type and vaccine-type VZV establish latency, and long-term immunity to varicella develops. However, immunity does not protect against reactivation.

VZV also infects guinea pig enteric neurons in vitro, establishes latency and can be reactivated. We therefore determined whether lymphocytes infected in vitro with VZV secrete infectious virions and can transfer infection in vivo to the ENS of recipient guinea pigs. T lymphocytes (CD3-immunoreactive) were preferentially infected following co-culture of guinea pig or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with VZV-infected HELF. VZV proliferated in the infected T cells and expressed immediate early and late VZV genes. Electron microscopy confirmed that VZV-infected T cells produced encapsulated virions. Extracellular virus, however, was pleomorphic, suggesting degradation occurred prior to release, which was confirmed by the failure of VZV-infected T cells to secrete infectious virions. Intravenous injection of WT- or vOka-infected PBMCs, nevertheless, transmitted VZV to recipient animals (guinea pig\u2009>\u2009human lymphocytes). Two days post-inoculation, lung and liver, but not gut, contained DNA and transcripts encoding ORFs 4, 40, 66 and 67. Twenty-eight days after infection, gut contained DNA and transcripts encoding ORFs 4 and 66 but neither DNA nor transcripts could any longer be found in lung or liver. In situ hybridization revealed VZV DNA in enteric neurons, which also expressed ORF63p (but not ORF68p) immunoreactivity. Observations suggest that VZV infects T cells, which can transfer VZV to and establish latency in enteric neurons in vivo.

The vOka vaccine strain comprises a mixture of genotypes and, despite attenuation, causes rashes in small numbers of recipients. Like wild-type virus, the vaccine establishes latency in neuronal tissue and can later reactivate to cause Herpes zoster (shingles). Using hybridization-based methodologies, we have purified and sequenced vOka directly from skin lesions. We show that alleles present in the vaccine can be recovered from the lesions and demonstrate the presence of a severe bottleneck between inoculation and lesion formation. Genotypes in any one lesion appear to be descended from one to three vaccine-genotypes with a low frequency of novel mutations. No single vOka haplotype and no novel mutations are consistently present in rashes, indicating that neither new mutations nor recombination with wild type are critical to the evolution of vOka rashes. Instead, alleles arising from attenuation (i.e., not derived from free-living virus) are present at lower frequencies in rash genotypes. We identify 11 loci at which the ancestral allele is selected for in vOka rash formation and show genotypes in rashes that have reactivated from latency cannot be distinguished from rashes occurring immediately after inoculation. We conclude that the vOka vaccine, although heterogeneous, has not evolved to form rashes through positive selection in the mode of a quasispecies, but rather alleles that were essentially neutral during the vaccine production have been selected against in the human subjects, allowing us to identify key loci for rash formation.", "Keywords": ["alphaherpesvirus", "pathogenesis", "viral evolution"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Evolution, Molecular", "Exanthema", "Genome, Viral", "Genotype", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation Rate", "Phylogeny", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Selection, Genetic", "Skin", "Viral Vaccines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel P", "Last Name": "Depledge", "Affiliation": "MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Samit", "Last Name": "Kundu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nancy J", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eleanor R", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meleri", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Steinberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Gershon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul R", "Last Name": "Kinchington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "D Scott", "Last Name": "Schmid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francois", "Last Name": "Balloux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Breuer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular biology and evolution", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24092852", "Title": "Pathogenesis and current approaches to control of varicella-zoster virus infections.", "Abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was once thought to be a fairly innocuous pathogen.
