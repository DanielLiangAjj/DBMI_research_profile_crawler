Cigarette smoke is a causative factor; however, not all heavy smokers develop COPD. Microbial colonization and infections are contributing factors to disease progression in advanced stages. Objectives: We investigated whether lower airway dysbiosis occurs in mild-to-moderate COPD and analyzed possible mechanistic contributions to COPD pathogenesis. Methods: We recruited 57 patients with a >10 pack-year smoking history: 26 had physiological evidence of COPD, and 31 had normal lung function (smoker control subjects). Bronchoscopy sampled the upper airways, lower airways, and environmental background. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, whole genome, RNA metatranscriptome, and host RNA transcriptome. A preclinical mouse model was used to evaluate the contributions of cigarette smoke and dysbiosis on lower airway inflammatory injury. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with smoker control subjects, microbiome analyses showed that the lower airways of subjects with COPD were enriched with common oral commensals. The lower airway host transcriptomics demonstrated differences in markers of inflammation and tumorigenesis, such as upregulation of IL-17, IL-6, ERK/MAPK, PI3K, MUC1, and MUC4 in mild-to-moderate COPD. Finally, in a preclinical murine model exposed to cigarette smoke, lower airway dysbiosis with common oral commensals augments the inflammatory injury, revealing transcriptomic signatures similar to those observed in human subjects with COPD. Conclusions: Lower airway dysbiosis in the setting of smoke exposure contributes to inflammatory injury early in COPD. Targeting the lower airway microbiome in combination with smoking cessation may be of potential therapeutic relevance.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "lung inflammation", "metatranscriptomics", "microbiome", "transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Dysbiosis", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Inflammation", "Lung Injury", "Lung"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Imran", "Last Name": "Sulaiman", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin G", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Systems Genomics Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Isaacs", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jun-Chieh J", "Last Name": "Tsay", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Meredith", "Last Name": "Holub", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Clea R", "Last Name": "Barnett", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Kwok", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthias C", "Last Name": "Kugler", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jake G", "Last Name": "Natalini", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Shivani", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yonghua", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Rosemary", "Last Name": "Schluger", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Carpenito", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Destiny", "Last Name": "Collazo", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Luisanny", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yaa", "Last Name": "Kyeremateng", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Miao", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Christina D", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Philip M", "Last Name": "Hansbro", "Affiliation": "Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute and University of Technology Sydney, School of Life Sciences, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Beno W", "Last Name": "Oppenheimer", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth I", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Roberta M", "Last Name": "Goldring", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sergei B", "Last Name": "Koralov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Weiden", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University School of Medicine, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine", "Last Name": "D'Armiento", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University School of Medicine, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Jose C", "Last Name": "Clemente", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elodie", "Last Name": "Ghedin", "Affiliation": "Systems Genomics Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Leopoldo N", "Last Name": "Segal", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2023Nov15"}, {"PMID": "37127876", "Title": "Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Diminish Renal Neoplasms in a Tuberous Sclerosis Model Via Induction of Apoptosis.", "Abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumors are presently incurable despite a cytostatic response to mTOR pathway inhibition because recurrence of disease occurs after treatment is discontinued. Here, we explored the hypothesis that inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity in mesenchymal lineage-specific platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling in TSC tumors is cytocidal and attenuates tumorigenesis at significantly higher levels than treatment with an mTOR inhibitor. Rapamycin-induced versus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) tumor cells were comparatively analyzed using cell survival assays, RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics to distinguish tumoricidal mechanisms adopted by each drug type. The efficacy of imatinib therapy was validated against spontaneously developing renal cystadenomas in tuberous sclerosis Tsc2+/- mouse models (C57BL/6J mice; N = 6; 400 mg/kg/d; oral gavage) compared with Tsc2+/- mice treated with PBS (C57BL/6J mice; N = 6). Our study revealed that TKIs imatinib and nilotinib were cytocidal to both pulmonary LAM and renal AML cell cultures through the downregulation of the glycoprotein GPVI pathway and resultant disruption in mitochondrial permeability, increased cytosolic cytochrome C, and caspase 3 activation. Importantly, renal tumor growth was significantly attenuated in imatinib-treated Tsc2+/- mice compared with PBS treatment. The preclinical studies reported here provide evidence documenting the effectiveness of TKIs in limiting LAM and AML cell growth and viability with important clinical potential.

To investigate this, MMP13-knockout (Mmp13 -/- ) mice were used to analyze phenotypic changes in the dentin-pulp complex, mineralization-associated marker-expression, and mechanistic interactions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated high MMP13-expression in pulp-tissue, ameloblasts, odontoblasts, and dentin in developing WT-molars, which reduced in adults, with human-DPC cultures demonstrating a >2000-fold increase in Mmp13-expression during mineralization. Morphologically, Mmp13 -/- molars displayed critical alterations in the dentin-phenotype, affecting dentin-tubule regularity, the odontoblast-palisade and predentin-definition with significantly reduced dentin volume (\u223c30% incisor; 13% molar), and enamel and dentin mineral-density. Reactionary-tertiary-dentin in response to injury was reduced at Mmp13 -/- molar cusp-tips but with significantly more dystrophic pulpal mineralization in MMP13-null samples. Odontoblast differentiation-markers, nestin and DSP, reduced in expression after MMP13-loss in vivo, with reduced calcium deposition in MMP13-null DPC cultures. RNA-sequencing analysis of WT and Mmp13 -/- pulp highlighted 5,020 transcripts to have significantly >2.0-fold change, with pathway-analysis indicating downregulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway, supported by reduced in vivo expression of the Wnt-responsive gene Axin2. Mmp13 interaction with Axin2 could be partly responsible for the loss of odontoblastic activity and alteration to the tooth phenotype and volume which is evident in this study.

In mice, lymphatic dysfunction alone is sufficient to cause lung injury that resembles human emphysema. Whether lymphatic function is disrupted in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced emphysema is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of CS on lung lymphatic function. Analysis of human lung tissue revealed significant lung lymphatic thrombosis in patients with emphysema compared to control smokers that increased with disease severity. In a mouse model, CS exposure led to lung lymphatic thrombosis, decreased lymphatic drainage, and impaired leukocyte trafficking that all preceded the development of emphysema. Proteomic analysis demonstrated an increased abundance of coagulation factors in the lymph draining from the lungs of CS-exposed mice compared to control mice. In addition, in vitro assays demonstrated a direct effect of CS on lymphatic endothelial cell integrity.

Myogenesis contributes to adult muscle integrity during injury-repair cycles. Injurious events crucially occur in the skeletal muscles of patients with COPD in the setting of exacerbations and infections, which lead to acute decompensations for limited periods of time, after which patients typically fail to recover the baseline status they had before the acute event. Autophagy, which is dysregulated in muscles from patients with COPD, is a key regulator of muscle stem-satellite- cells activation and myogenesis, yet very little research has so far mechanistically investigated the role of autophagy dysregulation in COPD muscles. Using a genetically inducible interleukin-13-driven pulmonary emphysema model leading to muscle dysfunction, and confirmed with a second genetic animal model, we found a significant myogenic dysfunction associated with the reduced proliferative capacity of satellite cells. Transplantation experiments followed by lineage tracing suggest that an intrinsic defect in satellite cells, and not in the COPD environment, plays a dominant role in the observed myogenic dysfunction. RNA sequencing analysis and direct observation of COPD mice satellite cells suggest dysregulated autophagy. Moreover, while autophagy flux experiments with bafilomycin demonstrated deacceleration of autophagosome turnover in COPD mice satellite cells, spermidine-induced autophagy stimulation leads to a higher replication rate and myogenesis in these animals.

Mutations in the Serpina1 gene cause AAT to form hepatoxic polymers, which can lead to reduced availability for the protein's primary function and severe liver disease. An AAT antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was previously identified to be beneficial for the AATD liver disease by blocking the mutated AAT transcripts. Here we hypothesized that knockdown of AAT aggravates murine lung injury during smoke exposure and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 4 groups each for the smoking and smoke-flu injury models. The ASO and control (No-ASO) were injected subcutaneously starting with smoking or four days prior to influenza infection and then injected weekly at 50 mg/kg body weight. ASO treatment during a 3-month smoke exposure significantly decreased the serum and lung AAT expression, resulting in increased Cela1 expression and elastase activity. However, despite the decrease in AAT, neither the inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) nor the lung structural changes were significantly worsened by ASO treatment. We observed significant differences in inflammation and emphysema due to smoke exposure, but did not observe an ASO treatment effect. Similarly, with the smoke-flu model, differences were only observed between smoke-flu and room air controls, but not as a result of ASO treatment. Off-target effects or compensatory mechanisms may account for this finding. Alternatively, the reduction of AAT with ASO treatment, while sufficient to protect from liver injury, may not be robust enough to lead to lung injury. The results also suggest that previously described AAT ASO treatment for AAT mutation related liver disease may attenuate hepatic injury without being detrimental to the lungs.

The genetic backgrounds of mice included wild-type, MyD88-knockout, and STAT3C backgrounds.Measurements and Main Results: 16S-rRNA gene sequencing characterized changes in microbiota. Flow cytometry, cytokine measurement via Luminex and RNA host-transcriptome sequencing was used to characterize the host immune phenotype. Although MOC aspiration correlated with lower-airway dysbiosis that resolved within 5 days, it induced an extended inflammatory response associated with IL-17-producing T cells lasting at least 14 days. MyD88 expression was required for the IL-17 response to MOC aspiration, but not for T-cell activation or IFN-\u03b3 expression. MOC aspiration before a respiratory challenge with S. pneumoniae led to a decrease in hosts' susceptibility to this pathogen.Conclusions: Thus, in otherwise healthy mice, a single aspiration event with oral commensals is rapidly cleared from the lower airways but induces a prolonged Th17 response that secondarily decreases susceptibility to S. pneumoniae. Translationally, these data implicate an immunoprotective role of episodic microaspiration of oral microbes in the regulation of the lung immune phenotype and mitigation of host susceptibility to infection with lower-airway pathogens.", "Keywords": ["inflammation", "microbiome", "pathogen susceptibility", "transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Prevotella melaninogenica", "Streptococcus mitis", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Th17 Cells", "Veillonella"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin G", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Imran", "Last Name": "Sulaiman", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jun-Chieh J", "Last Name": "Tsay", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Luisanny", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Brendan", "Last Name": "Franca", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yonghua", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Amber N", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Mariam", "Last Name": "El-Ashmawy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Carpenito", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Maya", "Last Name": "Sauthoff", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Yie", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Xiuxiu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose C", "Last Name": "Clemente", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bianca", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Tonia", "Last Name": "Zangari", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology."}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Mezzano", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Loomis", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Weiden", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sergei B", "Last Name": "Koralov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine", "Last Name": "D'Armiento", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Sunil K", "Last Name": "Ahuja", "Affiliation": "University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Xue-Ru", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Weiser", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology."}, {"First Name": "Leopoldo N", "Last Name": "Segal", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2021May01"}, {"PMID": "33026238", "Title": "Attenuation of pulmonary injury by an inhaled MMP inhibitor in the endotoxin lung injury model.", "Abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by pulmonary edema and poor gas exchange resulting from severe inflammatory lung injury. Neutrophilic infiltration and increased pulmonary vascular permeability are hallmarks of early ARDS and precipitate a self-perpetuating cascade of inflammatory signaling. The biochemical processes initiating these events remain unclear. Typically associated with extracellular matrix degradation, recent data suggest matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are regulators of pulmonary inflammation. To demonstrate that inhalation of a broad MMP inhibitor attenuates LPS induced pulmonary inflammation. Nebulized CGS27023AM (CGS) was administered to LPS-injured mice. Pulmonary CGS levels were examined by mass spectroscopy. Inflammatory scoring of hematoxylin-eosin sections, examination of vascular integrity via lung wet/dry and bronchoalveolar lvage/serum FITC-albumin ratios were performed. Cleaved caspase-3 levels were also assessed. Differential cell counts and pulse-chase labeling were utilized to determine the effects of CGS on neutrophil migration. The effects of CGS on human neutrophil migration and viability were examined using Boyden chambers and MTT assays. Nebulization successfully delivered CGS to the lungs. Treatment decreased pulmonary inflammatory scores, edema, and apoptosis in LPS treated animals. Neutrophil chemotaxis was reduced by CGS treatment, with inhalation causing significant reductions in both the total number and newly produced bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells infiltrating the lung. Mechanistic studies on cells isolated from humans demonstrate that CGS-treated neutrophils exhibit decreased chemotaxis. The protective effect observed following treatment with a nonspecific MMP inhibitor indicates that one or more MMPs mediate the development of pulmonary edema and neutrophil infiltration in response to LPS injury.

In Hmga2-/- mice, the M1 germs and crowns were diminished in size, and formation and eruption of molars were delayed with mandibular bone growth retardation.

This decreased cholesterol efflux results in lipid-laden macrophages. We hypothesize that cigarette smoke adversely affects cholesterol transport via an ABCA1-dependent mechanism in macrophages, enhancing TLR4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) signaling and resulting in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) up-regulation and exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation. ABCA1 is significantly down-regulated in the lung upon smoke exposure conditions. Macrophages exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo and in vitro exhibit impaired cholesterol efflux correlating with significantly decreased ABCA1 expression, up-regulation of the TLR4/Myd88 pathway, and downstream MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression. Treatment with liver X receptor (LXR) agonist restores ABCA1 expression after short-term smoke exposure and attenuates the inflammatory response; after long-term smoke exposure, there is also attenuated physiologic and morphologic changes of emphysema. In vitro, treatment with LXR agonist decreases macrophage inflammatory activation in wild-type but not ABCA1 knockout mice, suggesting an ABCA1-dependent mechanism of action. These studies demonstrate an important association between cigarette smoke exposure and cholesterol-mediated pathways in the macrophage inflammatory response. Modulation of these pathways through manipulation of ABCA1 activity effectively blocks cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and provides a potential novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.-Sonett, J., Goldklang, M., Sklepkiewicz, P., Gerber, A., Trischler, J., Zelonina, T., Westerterp, M., Lema\u00eetre, V., Okada, V., D'Armiento, J.

In this study, we used a mouse model of chronic exposure to intranasal house dust mite (HDM) extract to dissect how lung TRMs are generated and function in the persistence and pathogenesis of allergic airway disease. We demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate into the lung tissue during acute HDM exposure; however, only CD4+ TRMs, and not CD8+ TRMs, persist long term following cessation of HDM administration. Lung CD4+ TRMs are localized around airways and are rapidly reactivated upon allergen re-exposure accompanied by the rapid induction of airway hyperresponsiveness independent of circulating T cells. Lung CD4+ TRM activation to HDM challenge is also accompanied by increased recruitment and activation of dendritic cells in the lungs.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is secreted by macrophages and robustly increases in the left ventricle (LV) with age. The present study investigated the effect of MMP-9 overexpression in macrophages on cardiac aging. We compared 16- to 21-mo-old C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) male and female mice (n = 15-20/group). MMP-9 overexpression amplified the hypertrophic response to aging, as evidenced by increased LV wall thickness and myocyte cross-sectional areas (P < 0.05 for both). MMP-9 overexpression reduced LV expression of the angiogenesis-related factors ICAM-1, integrins \u03b13 and \u03b23, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, thrombospondin-1, tenascin-c, and versican (all P < 0.05). Concomitantly, the number of vessels in the TG was lower than WT LV (P < 0.05). This led to a mismatch in the muscle-to-vessel ratio and resulted in increased cardiac inflammation. Out of 84 inflammatory genes analyzed, 16 genes increased in the TG compared with WT (all P < 0.05). Of the elevated genes, 14 were proinflammatory genes. The increase in cardiac inflammation resulted in greater accumulation of interstitial collagen in TG (P < 0.05). Fractional shortening was similar between groups, indicating that global cardiac function was still preserved at this age. In conclusion, overexpression of MMP-9 in macrophages resulted in exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy in the setting of vessel rarefaction, which resulted in enhanced inflammation and fibrosis to augment the cardiac-aging phenotype. Our results provide evidence that macrophage-derived MMP-9 may be a therapeutic target in elderly subjects.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study was the first to use mice with transgenic overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in macrophages to examine the effects of macrophage-derived MMP-9 on cardiac aging.

To overcome these existing shortcomings, parenchymal airspace profiling (PAP) was developed to provide a more detailed and unbiased quantitative method. Following the standard protocols of fixation, embedding, and sectioning, lung micrographs were: (1) marked with nonparenchymal area, preprocessed, and binarized under the researcher's supervision; (2) analyzed with a statistical learning method, Gaussian mixture model, to provide an unbiased categorization of parenchymal airspace compartments, corresponding to a single alveolus, alveolar sac, and ductal/destructive airspace; and (3) further quantified into morphometric parameters, including reference volume, alveolar count, and ductal/destructive fraction (DF) based on stereological principles. PAP was performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections from mice and rabbits. Unbiased categorization revealed differences in alveolar size among several mouse strains (NZW/LacJ<AKR/J<A/J<C57BL/6J) and across species (mouse<rabbit). Further quantification indicates that parenchymal destruction, modeled in mouse lungs with 1-month smoke exposure, resulted in decreased alveolar count, increased DF, but no significant differences in mean linear intercept.

Genetically, TSC is said to occur through a classical biallelic inactivation of either TSC genes (TSC1, hamartin or TSC2, tuberin), an event that is implicated in the induction of the mTOR pathway and subsequent tumorigenesis. High Mobility Group A2 (HMGA2), an architectural transcription factor, is known to regulate mesenchymal differentiation and drive mesenchymal tumorigenesis in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of HMGA2 in the pathogenesis of TSC using the TSC2(+/-) mouse model that similarly mirrors human disease and human tumor samples. We show that HMGA2 expression was detected in 100% of human and mouse TSC tumors and that HMGA2 activation was required for TSC mesenchymal tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse models. In contrast to the current dogma, the mTOR pathway was not activated in all TSC2(+/-) tumors and was elevated in only 50% of human mesenchymal tumors. Moreover, except for a subset of kidney tumors, tuberin was expressed in both human and mouse tumors. Therefore, haploinsufficiency of one TSC tumor suppressor gene was required for tumor initiation, but further tumorigenesis did not require the second hit, as previously postulated.

Using an in vivo house dust mite asthma model, Wnt10b-deficient (Wnt10b(-/-)) mice were allergen-sensitized and inflammation, as well as T cell activation, was studied in vivo and in vitro. Wnt10b(-/-) mice exhibited an augmented inflammatory phenotype with an increase in eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage and IL-4 and IL-13 in the lungs when compared with wild-type mice. In vitro studies confirmed an increased T helper type 2 polarization and increased T cell activation of Wnt10b(-/-) cells. Accordingly, the percentage of naive T cells was elevated by the addition of recombinant Wnt10b protein. Finally, Wnt10b(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in the percentage of effector T cells in the lungs after house dust mite sensitization, which indicated a heightened activation state, measured by an increased percentage of CD69(hi)CD11a(hi) cells.

We reconsider the underlying mechanism of tuberculosis pathology and demonstrate that collagen destruction may be a critical initial event, causing caseous necrosis as opposed to resulting from it. In human tuberculosis granulomas, regions of extracellular matrix destruction map to areas of caseous necrosis. In mice, transgenic expression of human matrix metalloproteinase 1 causes caseous necrosis, the pathological hallmark of human tuberculosis. Collagen destruction is the principal pathological difference between humanised mice and wild-type mice with tuberculosis, whereas the release of proinflammatory cytokines does not differ, demonstrating that collagen breakdown may lead to cell death and caseation. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a 3-dimensional cell culture model of tuberculosis granuloma formation, using bioelectrospray technology. Collagen improved survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected cells analyzed on the basis of a lactate dehydrogenase release assay, propidium iodide staining, and measurement of the total number of viable cells.

Previous work has indicated that local changes in wall stiffness can be detected with pulse wave imaging (PWI), which is a non-invasive technique for tracking the propagation of pulse waves along the aorta at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of PWI to monitor and stage AAA progression in a murine model of the disease. ApoE/TIMP-1 knockout mice (N = 18) were given angiotensin II for 30 days via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. The suprarenal sections of the abdominal aortas were imaged every 2-3 d after implantation using a 30-MHz VisualSonics Vevo 770 with 15-\u03bcm lateral resolution. Pulse wave propagation was monitored at an effective frame rate of 8 kHz by using retrospective electrocardiogram gating and by performing 1-D cross-correlation on the radiofrequency signals to obtain the displacements induced by the waves. In normal aortas, the pulse waves propagated at constant velocities (2.8 \u00b1 0.9 m/s, r(2) = 0.89 \u00b1 0.11), indicating that the composition of these vessels was relatively homogeneous. In the mice that developed AAAs (N = 10), the wave speeds in the aneurysm sac were 45% lower (1.6 \u00b1 0.6 m/s) and were more variable (r(2) = 0.66 \u00b1 0.23). Moreover, the wave-induced wall displacements were at least 80% lower within the sacs compared with the surrounding vessel. Finally, in mice that developed fissures (N = 5) or ruptures (N = 3) at the sites of their AAA, higher displacements directed out of the lumen and with no discernible wave pattern (r(2) < 0.20) were observed throughout the cardiac cycle. These findings indicate that PWI can be used to distinguish normal murine aortas from aneurysmal, fissured and ruptured ones.

Previous studies have shown the effects of the SFRP1 gene on lung development using the SFRP1 knockout mouse model via histological and physiological studies. In this study, the feasibility of ADC (acquired via HP (3)He) to detect altered lung structure in the SFRP1 knockout (SFRP1(-/-)) mice was investigated, and compared to analysis by histology. This study consisted of two groups, the wild-type (WT) mice and the knockout (KO) mice with n=6 mice for each group. (3)He ADC MRI and histology were performed on all of the animals. The global Lm values of WT and KO mice were 35.0\u00b10.8\u03bcm and 38.4\u00b13.8\u03bcm, respectively, which translated to an increase of 9.58% in the Lm of KO mice. The mean global ADCs for the WT and KO mice were 0.12\u00b10.01cm(2)/s and 0.13\u00b10.01cm(2)/s, respectively, which equated to a relative increase of 8.0% in the KO mice compared to the WT mice. In the sub-analysis of the anterior, medial and posterior lung regions, Lm increased by 10.50%, 6.66% and 11.84% in the KO mice, respectively, whereas the differences in ADC between the two groups in the anterior, medial, and posterior regions were 7.3%, 8.3%, and 4.6%, respectively. These results suggest that HP MRI measurements can be used as a suitable substitute for histology to obtain valuable information about lung geometry non-invasively.

Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate lung PP2A activity remain to be determined. The redox-sensitive enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) activates PP2A by dephosphorylating the catalytic subunit of the protein at tyrosine 307. This study aimed to identify how the interaction between the intracellular antioxidant glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) and PTP1B affected lung PP2A activity and airway inflammation. Experiments using gene silencing techniques in mouse lung or human small airway epithelial cells determined that knocking down PTP1B expression blocked GPx-1's activation of PP2A and negated the anti-inflammatory effects of GPx-1 protein in the lung. Similarly, the expression of human GPx-1 in transgenic mice significantly increased PP2A and PTP1B activities and prevented chronic cigarette smoke-induced airway inflammation and alveolar destruction. GPx-1 knockout mice, however, exhibited an exaggerated emphysema phenotype, correlating with a nonresponsive PP2A pathway. Importantly, GPx-1-PTP1B-PP2A signaling becomes inactivated in advanced lung disease. Indeed, PTP1B protein was oxidized in the lungs of subjects with advanced emphysema, and cigarette smoke did not increase GPx-1 or PTP1B activity within epithelial cells isolated from subjects with COPD, unlike samples of healthy lung epithelial cells.

These findings identify electrical dysregulation within VSM, specifically the reduction of BK currents, as a key molecular mechanism sensitizing resistance vessels to pressure-induced vasoconstriction in systolic HF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Signaling", "Heart Failure", "Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mesenteric Arteries", "Mice", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Vascular Resistance", "Vasoconstriction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA. sm460@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Jared S", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Wei", "Last Name": "Nui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neelesh", "Last Name": "Chudasama", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Waase", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darshan", "Last Name": "Doshi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shinichi", "Last Name": "Iwata", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Shiomi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeanine", "Last Name": "D'Armiento", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shunichi", "Last Name": "Homma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "PubDate": "2013May"}]
