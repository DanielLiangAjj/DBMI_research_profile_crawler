"Abstract": "White matter pathways, typically studied with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been implicated in the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, due to limited sample sizes and the predominance of single-site studies, the generalizability of OCD classification based on diffusion white matter estimates remains unclear. Here, we tested classification accuracy using the largest OCD DTI dataset to date, involving 1336 adult participants (690 OCD patients and 646 healthy controls) and 317 pediatric participants (175 OCD patients and 142 healthy controls) from 18 international sites within the ENIGMA OCD Working Group. We used an automatic machine learning pipeline (with feature engineering and selection, and model optimization) and examined the cross-site generalizability of the OCD classification models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Our models showed low-to-moderate accuracy in classifying (1) \"OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve\u2009=\u200957.19\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47 in the replication set; Children, 59.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39), (2) \"unmedicated OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, 62.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.84; Children, 48.51\u2009\u00b1\u200910.14), and (3) \"medicated OCD vs. unmedicated OCD\" (Adults, 76.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.97; Children, 72.45\u2009\u00b1\u20098.87). There was significant site variability in model performance (cross-validated ROC AUC ranges 51.6-79.1 in adults; 35.9-63.2 in children). Machine learning interpretation showed that diffusivity measures of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and posterior thalamic radiation contributed to the classification of OCD from HC. The classification performance appeared greater than the model trained on grey matter morphometry in the prior ENIGMA OCD study (our study includes subsamples from the morphometry study). Taken together, this study points to the meaningful multivariate patterns of white matter features relevant to the neurobiology of OCD, but with low-to-moderate classification accuracy. The OCD classification performance may be constrained by site variability and medication effects on the white matter integrity, indicating room for improvement for future research.", "Keywords": [],

prevention (EX/RP) can be delivered as monotherapy or to augment serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). While both options are considered effective OCD treatments, responses are heterogenous. Substantial work has investigated EX/RP predictors to account for this variability in responses, with mixed findings. Little research has studied whether EX/RP predictors may differ in medicated versus non-medicated samples (i.e., medication status as a moderator). We pooled data from two clinical trials conducted concurrently in the same specialty OCD clinic. One enrolled patients who were on stable SRI doses (EX/RP as SRI augmentation, n=58) while the other enrolled non-medicated patients (EX/RP monotherapy, n=38). Both trials used the same manualized EX/RP protocol and blinded independent evaluators. LASSO regression derived predictors and moderators of outcome. Improvement did not significantly differ between the EX/RP alone group and the SRI+EX/RP group. In both groups, higher baseline OCD severity and worse quality of life predicted poorer outcome. OCPD traits moderated results: Patients with more severe OCPD traits had better outcomes from EX/RP monotherapy than those receiving EX/RP with SRIs. Patient adherence to EX/RP homework mediated the associations between the baseline variables and outcome. The effect of OCPD traits on outcome warrants future study to improve care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Wheaton", "Affiliation": "Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Rosenfield", "Affiliation": "Rosenfield Analytics, Denver, CO USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Rosenfield", "Affiliation": "Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Edna B", "Last Name": "Foa", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "37732425", "Title": "Maternal childhood maltreatment: associations to offspring brain volume and white matter connectivity.", "Abstract": "The deleterious effects of adversity are likely intergenerational, such that one generation's adverse experiences can affect the next. Epidemiological studies link maternal adversity to offspring depression and anxiety, possibly via transmission mechanisms that influence offspring fronto-limbic connectivity. However, studies have not thoroughly disassociated postnatal exposure effects nor considered the role of offspring sex. We utilized infant neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that maternal childhood maltreatment (CM) would be associated with increased fronto-limbic connectivity in infancy and tested brain-behavior associations in childhood. Ninety-two dyads participated (32 mothers with CM, 60 without; 52 infant females, 40 infant males). Women reported on their experiences of CM and non-sedated sleeping infants underwent MRIs at 2.44 \u00b1 2.74 weeks. Brain volumes were estimated via structural MRI and white matter structural connectivity (fiber counts) via diffusion MRI with probabilistic tractography. A subset of parents (n = 36) reported on children's behaviors at age 5.17 \u00b1 1.73 years. Males in the maltreatment group demonstrated greater intra-hemispheric fronto-limbic connectivity (b = 0.96, p= 0.008, [95%CI 0.25, 1.66]), no differences emerged for females. Fronto-limbic connectivity was related to somatic complaints in childhood only for males (r = 0.673, p = 0.006). Our findings suggest that CM could have intergenerational associations to offspring brain development, yet mechanistic studies are needed.", "Keywords": ["Adversity", "infant neuroimaging",

capacity among children at risk for depression.", "Abstract": "A maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a well-known risk factor for depression in offspring. However, the mechanism through which familial risk is transmitted remains unclear. Cognitive control alterations are common in MDD, and thus, the current study investigated whether altered control capacity is transmitted intergenerationally, and whether it then contributes to the developmental pathways through which depression is passed from mothers to children. We recruited children (N\u00a0=\u00a065) ages 4-10-years-old, of which 47.7 % (n\u00a0=\u00a031) reported a maternal history of MDD, and their biological mother (N\u00a0=\u00a065). Children performed a child-friendly Go/NoGo task while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded, and mothers performed a Flanker task. Children exhibited heightened sensitivity to error versus correct responses, which was characterized by an error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe) as well as prominent delta and frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations. Interestingly, worse maternal performance on the Flanker task associated with an increased Go/NoGo error rate and a smaller ERN and Pe in children. However, there was no association between maternal or child control indices with child depression symptoms. Our results suggest a familial influence of cognitive control capacity in mother-child dyads, but it remains unclear whether this confers risk for depressive symptoms in children. Further research is necessary to determine whether alterations in cognitive control over time may influence symptom development in at-risk children.", "Keywords": ["ERN", "Error monitoring", "Frontal midline theta", "Maternal depression"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Child, Preschool", "Child", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Depression", "Electroencephalography", "Mothers", "Cognition", "Evoked Potentials"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akina", "Last Name": "Umemoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhixin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emma M", "Last Name": "Millon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina S", "Last Name": "Koshy", "Affiliation": "Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sydney M", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisa N", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Monk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Behavioral Medicine, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Rosellini", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Division of Clinical Developmental Neuroscience, Sackler Institute, New York, NY, USA.

Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t\u2009=\u2009-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and longer illness duration (t\u2009=\u2009-2.22, p\u2009=\u20090.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Adolescent", "Humans", "Child", "Dopamine", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. david.pagliaccio@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Wengler", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Durham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martine", "Last Name": "Fontaine", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meryl", "Last Name": "Rueppel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Becker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Bilek", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Pieper", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Risdon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kate D", "Last Name": "Fitzgerald", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37131072", "Title": "The functional connectome in obsessive-compulsive disorder: resting-state mega-analysis and machine learning classification for the ENIGMA-OCD consortium.", "Abstract": "Current knowledge about functional connectivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is based on small-scale studies, limiting the generalizability of results. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused only on predefined regions or functional networks rather than connectivity throughout the entire brain. Here, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity between OCD patients and healthy controls (HC) using mega-analysis of data from 1024 OCD patients and 1028 HC from 28 independent samples of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed group differences in whole-brain functional connectivity at both the regional and network level, and investigated whether functional connectivity could serve as biomarker to identify patient status at the individual level using machine learning analysis. The mega-analyses revealed widespread abnormalities in functional connectivity in OCD, with global hypo-connectivity (Cohen's d: -0.27 to -0.13) and few hyper-connections, mainly with the thalamus (Cohen's d: 0.19 to 0.22). Most hypo-connections were located within the sensorimotor network and no fronto-striatal abnormalities were found. Overall, classification performances were poor, with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) scores ranging between 0.567 and 0.673, with better classification for medicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.702) than unmedicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.608) patients versus healthy controls. These findings provide partial support for existing pathophysiological models of OCD and highlight the important role of the sensorimotor network in OCD.

However, there is little evidence for a form of implicit memory or priming. The present aim was to determine if priming is evident in utero. Fetal HR, maternal HR and maternal respiratory rate (RR) were examined in 105 women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Women experienced two counterbalanced laboratory tasks, the Stroop task and the paced breathing task, and their cardiorespiratory activity functioned as a stimulus for fetuses. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed maternal HR increased during the Stroop task but only when the Stroop task was presented first (89.64 bpm to 92.39 bpm) (p = 0.04). Maternal RR increased during the Stroop task, regardless of task order (17.72 bpm to 21.11 bpm; 18.50 bpm to 22.60 bpm) (p < 0.01). Fetal HR increased during the paced breathing task, but only when it followed maternal exposure to the Stroop task (141.13 bpm to 143.97 bpm) (p < 0.01). Fetuses registered maternal HR and RR reactivity to the Stroop task, which influenced their response during maternal engagement with a related task, suggesting priming.

Particular thalamic subregions may drive these differences. The ENIGMA-OCD working group conducted mega- and meta-analyses to study thalamic subregional volume in OCD across the lifespan. Structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 2649 OCD patients and 2774 healthy controls across 29 sites (50 datasets) were processed using the FreeSurfer built-in ThalamicNuclei pipeline to extract five thalamic subregions. Volume measures were harmonized for site effects using ComBat before running separate multiple linear regression models for children, adolescents, and adults to estimate volumetric group differences. All analyses were pre-registered ( https://osf.io/73dvy ) and adjusted for age, sex and intracranial volume. Unmedicated pediatric OCD patients (<12 years) had larger lateral (d\u2009=\u20090.46), pulvinar (d\u2009=\u20090.33), ventral (d\u2009=\u20090.35) and whole thalamus (d\u2009=\u20090.40) volumes at unadjusted p-values <0.05. Adolescent patients showed no volumetric differences. Adult OCD patients compared with controls had smaller volumes across all subregions (anterior, lateral, pulvinar, medial, and ventral) and smaller whole thalamic volume (d\u2009=\u2009-0.15 to -0.07) after multiple comparisons correction, mostly driven by medicated patients and associated with symptom severity. The anterior thalamus was also significantly smaller in patients after adjusting for thalamus size. Our results suggest that OCD-related thalamic volume differences are global and not driven by particular subregions and that the direction of effects are driven by both age and medication status.",

We investigate white matter connectivity associated with the stimulation-induced non-motor acute clinical effects in three domains: mood changes, dizziness, and sweating. We performed whole-brain probabilistic tractography seeded from the domain-specific stimulation volumes. The resultant connectivity maps were statistically compared across patients. The cortical voxels associated with each non-motor domain were compared with stimulation-induced motor improvements in a multivariate model. The resulting voxel maps were thresholded for false discovery (FDR q\u2009<\u20090.05) and clustered using a multimodal atlas. We also performed a group-level parcellation of stimulation volumes to identify the local pathways associated with each non-motor domain. The non-motor effects were rarely observed during stimulation titration: from 1100 acute clinical effects, mood change was observed in 14, dizziness in 23, and sweating in 20. Distinct cortical clusters were associated with each domain; notably, mood change was associated with voxels in the salience network and dizziness with voxels in the visual association cortex. The subthalamic parcellation yielded a mediolateral gradient, with the motor parcel being lateral and the non-motor parcels medial. We also observed an anteroposterior organization in the medial non-motor clusters with mood changes being anterior, followed posteriorly by dizziness, and sweating. We interpret these findings based on the literature and foresee these to be useful in guiding DBS programming.", "Keywords": ["Connectivity", "Deep brain stimulation", "Non-motor effects", "Parkinson

However, prior studies have yielded inconsistent findings, perhaps because small sample sizes provided insufficient power to detect subtle abnormalities. Here we investigated microstructural white matter alterations and their relation to clinical features in the largest dataset of adult and pediatric OCD to date. We analyzed diffusion tensor imaging metrics from 700 adult patients and 645 adult controls, as well as 174 pediatric patients and 144 pediatric controls across 19 sites participating in the ENIGMA OCD Working Group, in a cross-sectional case-control magnetic resonance study. We extracted measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) as main outcome, and mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity as secondary outcomes for 25 white matter regions. We meta-analyzed patient-control group differences (Cohen's d) across sites, after adjusting for age and sex, and investigated associations with clinical characteristics. Adult OCD patients showed significant FA reduction in the sagittal stratum (d\u2009=\u2009-0.21, z\u2009=\u2009-3.21, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and posterior thalamic radiation (d\u2009=\u2009-0.26, z\u2009=\u2009-4.57, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

This notion is further supported by use of the same treatments-cognitive behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication-for managing both OCD and non-OCD anxiety disorders in clinical settings. While early intervention with these gold standard treatments is recommended for pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders, young patients often remain symptomatic even after treatment. To guide the development of novel, mechanistically targeted treatments to better resolve OCD and anxiety symptoms, the identification of neural circuits underlying psychological constructs with relevance across disorders has been recommended. One construct that may be relevant for understanding pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders is cognitive control, given the difficulty that young patients experience in dismissing obsessions, compulsions, and worry despite recognition that these symptoms are excessive and unreasonable. In this review, we examine findings from a growing body of literature implicating brain-behavioral markers of cognitive control in pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders, including before and after treatment.

Few studies have assessed functional connectivity within or between networks across the whole brain in unmedicated OCD patients or how patterns of connectivity predict response to exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) therapy, a first-line treatment for OCD. Herein, multiband resting-state functional MRI scans were collected from unmedicated, adult patients with OCD (n\u2009=\u200941) and healthy participants (n\u2009=\u200936); OCD patients were then offered twice weekly EX/RP (17 sessions). A whole-brain-network-based statistic approach was used to identify group differences in resting-state connectivity. We detected altered pre-treatment functional connectivity between task-positive regions in the temporal gyri (middle and superior) and regions of the cingulo-opercular and default networks in individuals with OCD. Signal extraction was performed using a reconstruction independent components analysis and isolated two independent subcomponents (IC1 and IC2) within this altered connectivity. In the OCD group, linear mixed-effects models tested whether IC1 or IC2 values predicted the slope of change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores across EX/RP treatment. Lower (more different from controls) IC2 score significantly predicted greater symptom reduction with EX/RP (Bonferroni-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.002). Collectively, these findings suggest that an altered balance between task-positive and task-negative regions centered around temporal gyri may contribute to difficulty controlling intrusive thoughts or urges to perform ritualistic behaviors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Implosive Therapy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neural Pathways", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tracey C", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 74, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ts2928@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 74, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marilyn", "Last Name": "Cyr", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 74, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 74, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 74, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2021Apr"}, {"PMID": "33033241", "Title": "Structural neuroimaging biomarkers for obsessive-compulsive disorder in the ENIGMA-OCD consortium: medication matters.", "Abstract": "No diagnostic biomarkers are available for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we aimed to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers for OCD, using 46 data sets with 2304 OCD patients and 2068 healthy controls from the ENIGMA consortium. We performed machine learning analysis of regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume and tested classification performance using cross-validation. Classification performance for OCD vs. controls using the complete sample with different classifiers and cross-validation strategies was poor. When models were validated on data from other sites, model performance did not exceed chance-level. In contrast, fair classification performance was achieved when patients were grouped according to their medication status. These results indicate that medication use is associated with substantial differences in brain anatomy that are widely distributed, and indicate that clinical heterogeneity contributes to the poor performance of structural MRI as a disease marker.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Brain", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"],

We further tested whether neighborhood SES was more predictive than household SES and whether SES effects on connectivity were associated with anxiety symptoms. We found reduced basolateral amygdala-vmPFC RSFC at earlier ages in participants from more disadvantaged neighborhoods; this effect was unique to neighborhood SES and absent for household SES. Furthermore, this reduced connectivity in more disadvantaged youth and increased connectivity in more advantaged youth were associated with less anxiety; children who deviated from the connectivity pattern associated with their neighborhood SES had more anxiety. These results demonstrate that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with accelerated maturation of amygdala-vmPFC RSFC and suggest that the pathophysiology of pediatric anxiety depends on a child's neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics.

"Neuroimaging has played an important part in advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). At the same time, neuroimaging studies of OCD have had notable limitations, including reliance on relatively small samples. International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls. Initial work has focused on studies of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, structural connectivity, and brain lateralization in children, adolescents and adults with OCD, also including the study on the commonalities and distinctions across different neurodevelopment disorders. Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications. Importantly, our work has shed new light on questions about whether structural and functional alterations found in OCD reflect neurodevelopmental changes, effects of the disease process, or medication impacts. We conclude with a summary of ongoing work by ENIGMA-OCD, and a consideration of future directions for neuroimaging research on OCD within and beyond ENIGMA.", "Keywords": ["ENIGMA", "MRI", "cortical

"Abstract": "According to the conflict monitoring theory, executive control requires two separable processes: conflict-monitoring and conflict-resolution. Deficits in executive control have been observed in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, it is not yet clear whether these deficits can be attributed to deficits in conflict-monitoring, in conflict-resolution, or in both. We examined this question by administrating the Simon task to 67 unmedicated adults with OCD and 67 matched controls. The interference effect (incongruent minus congruent) was used to measure conflict-resolution. Trial-by-trial dynamic adaptation (i.e., the Gratton effect), which is indicated by smaller interference effect after conflict-laden trials compared to after non-conflict-laden trials, was used to measure conflict-monitoring. A similar interference effect was found in both the OCD and HC groups with no significant between group differences. Following incongruent trials, the interference effect became smaller for the control group as expected, but was completely eliminated for the OCD group. These data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that conflict-resolution is not globally deficient in unmedicated OCD patients and provide direct evidence that conflict-monitoring is heightened in OCD patients. Our results challenge the assumption of cognitive inflexibility in OCD and highlight the importance of studying unmedicated subjects when investigating executive control.", "Keywords": ["Dynamic adaptation", "Executive control", "Flexibility", "Gratton effect", "Obsessive compulsive disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Attention", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eyal", "Last Name": "Kalanthroff", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA.

Large-scale investigation of structural covariance networks in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may provide clues to the pathophysiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Using T1-weighted MRI scans acquired from 1616 individuals with OCD and 1463 healthy controls across 37 datasets participating in the ENIGMA-OCD Working Group, we calculated intra-individual brain structural covariance networks (using the bilaterally-averaged values of 33 cortical surface areas, 33 cortical thickness values, and six subcortical volumes), in which edge weights were proportional to the similarity between two brain morphological features in terms of deviation from healthy controls (i.e. z-score transformed). Global networks were characterized using measures of network segregation (clustering and modularity), network integration (global efficiency), and their balance (small-worldness), and their community membership was assessed. Hub profiling of regional networks was undertaken using measures of betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality. Individually calculated network measures were integrated across the 37 datasets using a meta-analytical approach. These network measures were summated across the network density range of K\u2009=\u20090.10-0.25 per participant, and were integrated across the 37 datasets using a meta-analytical approach. Compared with healthy controls, at a global level, the structural covariance networks of OCD showed lower clustering (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), lower modularity (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and lower small-worldness (P\u2009=\u20090.017). Detection of community membership emphasized lower network segregation in OCD compared to healthy controls. At the regional level, there were lower (rank-transformed) centrality values in OCD for volume of caudate nucleus and thalamus, and surface area of paracentral cortex, indicative of altered distribution of brain hubs. Centrality of cingulate and orbito-frontal as well as other brain areas was associated with OCD illness duration, suggesting greater involvement of these brain areas with illness chronicity. In summary, the findings of this study, the largest brain structural covariance study of OCD to date, point to a less segregated organization of structural covariance networks in OCD, and reorganization of brain hubs. The segregation findings suggest a possible signature of altered brain morphometry in OCD, while the hub findings point to OCD-related alterations in trajectories of brain development and maturation, particularly in cingulate and orbitofrontal regions.", "Keywords": ["brain structural covariance network", "graph theory", "illness duration", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "pharmacotherapy"],

Nevertheless, the functioning of the neural circuits supporting spatial processing have yet to be assessed in children with NVLD. We compared the resting state functional connectivity of a spatial brain network among children with NVLD, children with reading disorder (RD), and typically developing (TD) children. Seventy-five participants (7-15 years old) were included in the study (20 TD, 24 NVLD, and 31 RD). Group differences in global efficiency and functional connectivity among 12 regions comprising a previously defined spatial network were evaluated. Associations with behavior were explored. Global efficiency of the spatial network associated positively with spatial ability and inversely with socioemotional problems. Within the spatial network, associations between left posterior cingulate (PCC) and right retrosplenial cortical activity were reduced in children with NVLD relative to those without spatial deficits (RD and TD). Connectivity between left PCC and right posterior cerebellum (Crus I and II) was reduced in both groups of children with learning disabilities (NVLD and RD) relative to TD children. Functional connectivity of the spatial network was atypically associated with cognitive and socioemotional performance in children with NVLD. Identifying a neurobiological substrate for NVLD provides evidence that it is a discrete clinical entity and suggests targets for treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Dyslexia", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Learning Disabilities", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Rest", "Spatial Navigation", "Spatial Processing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah M", "Last Name": "Banker", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Ramphal", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anika N", "Last Name": "Sigel", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Zeffiro", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA. amy.margolis@nyspi.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Jan17"}, {"PMID": "31952071", "Title": "Altered network connectivity predicts response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is commonly associated with alterations in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical brain networks. Yet, recent investigations of large-scale brain networks suggest that more diffuse alterations in brain connectivity may underlie its pathophysiology. Few studies have assessed functional connectivity within or between networks across the whole brain in pediatric OCD or how patterns of connectivity associate with treatment response. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 25 unmedicated, treatment-naive children and adolescents with OCD (12.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 years) and 23 matched healthy control (HC) participants (11.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 years) before participants with OCD completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants were re-scanned after 12-16 weeks. Whole-brain connectomic analyses were conducted to assess baseline group differences and group-by-time interactions, corrected for multiple comparisons. Relationships between functional connectivity and OCD symptoms pre- and post-CBT were examined using longitudinal cross-lagged panel modeling. Reduced connectivity in OCD relative to HC participants was detected between default mode and task-positive network regions. Greater (less altered) connectivity between left angular gyrus and left frontal pole predicted better response to CBT in the OCD group. Altered connectivity between task-positive and task-negative networks in pediatric OCD may contribute to the impaired control over intrusive thoughts early in the illness. This is the first study to show that altered connectivity between large-scale network regions may predict response to CBT in pediatric OCD, highlighting the clinical relevance of these networks as potential circuit-based targets for the development of novel treatments.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marilyn", "Last Name": "Cyr", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA. marilyn.cyr@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Yanes-Lukin", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martine", "Last Name": "Fontaine", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Moira A", "Last Name": "Rynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2020Jun"}, {"PMID": "31889307", "Title": "Structural neural markers of response to cognitive behavioral therapy in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective, first-line treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Herein, we investigate whether task-based neural activity can predict who responds best to EX/RP. Unmedicated adult patients with OCD (n = 36) and healthy participants (n = 33) completed the Simon Spatial Incompatibility Task during high-resolution, multiband functional MRI (fMRI); patients were then offered twice-weekly EX/RP (17 sessions). Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify brain regions where conflict-related activity moderated the slope of change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores across treatment. Conflict-related activity in the left pallidum and 35 cortical parcels/regions significantly predicted symptom improvement with EX/RP for patients with OCD (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). Significant parcels/regions included cingulo-opercular and default mode network regions, specifically the anterior insula and anterior and posterior cingulate. Summarizing across these parcels/regions, greater conflict-related activity predicted greater EX/RP response and which patients achieved remission (Y-BOCS score \u2264 12; Cohen's d = 1.68) with >80% sensitivity and specificity. The association between brain activity and treatment response was partially mediated by patient EX/RP adherence (b = -2.99; 43.61% of total effect; P = 0.02). Brain activity and adherence together were highly predictive of remission. Together, these findings suggest that cingulo-opercular and default mode regions typically implicated in task control and introspective processes, respectively, may be targets for novel treatments that augment the ability of persons with OCD to resolve cognitive conflict and thereby facilitate adherence to EX/RP, increasing the likelihood of remission.", "Keywords": ["OCD", "conflict", "exposure", "fMRI", "psychotherapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Implosive Therapy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032; david.pagliaccio@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Middleton", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Dianne", "Last Name": "Hezel", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shari", "Last Name": "Steinman", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ivar", "Last Name": "Snorrason", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Gershkovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Campeas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Pinto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Page", "Last Name": "Van Meter", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2019Oct08"}, {"PMID": "31178097", "Title": "Mapping Cortical and Subcortical Asymmetry in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Findings From the ENIGMA Consortium.", "Abstract": "Lateralized dysfunction has been suggested in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

We used fMRI to assess neural activity during the resolution of cognitive conflict on the Simon Spatial Incompatibility task and patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) from task control (TC) regions in 7-12-year-old children with RD compared to their typically developing (TD) peers. Relative to TD children (n\u2009=\u200917), those with RD (n\u2009=\u200916) over-engaged a right superior/medial frontal cluster during the resolution of conflict (p\u2009=\u2009.05). Relative to TD children (n\u2009=\u200918), those with RD (n\u2009=\u200917) also showed reduced RSFC (voxel-wise p\u2009<\u2009.001; cluster-size p\u2009<\u2009.05, FDR corrected) from cingulo-opercular seeds to left hemisphere fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal reading-related regions, perhaps reflecting reduced organization of TC circuits and reduced integration with reading-related regions. Children with RD additionally showed reduced RSFC between fronto-parietal and default mode network regions. Follow-up analyses in a subset of children with both useable task and resting state data (RD\u2009=\u200913; TD\u2009=\u200917) revealed that greater conflict-related activation of the right frontal Simon task ROI associated with better word-reading, perhaps suggesting a compensatory role for this over-engagement. Connectivity from fronto-parietal seeds significantly associated with Simon task performance and word-reading accuracy in RD children. These findings suggest that altered functioning and connectivity of control circuits may contribute to cognitive control deficits in children with RD.

Some methodologists claim that a one-stage individual-participant data (IPD) mega-analysis can be superior to a two-stage aggregated data meta-analysis, since more detailed computations can be performed in a mega-analysis. Before definitive conclusions regarding the performance of either method can be drawn, it is necessary to critically evaluate the methodology of, and results obtained by, meta- and mega-analyses. Methods: Here, we compare the inverse variance weighted random-effect meta-analysis model with a multiple linear regression mega-analysis model, as well as with a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analysis model, using data from 38 cohorts including 3,665 participants of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed the effect sizes and standard errors, and the fit of the models, to evaluate the performance of the different methods. Results: The mega-analytical models showed lower standard errors and narrower confidence intervals than the meta-analysis. Similar standard errors and confidence intervals were found for the linear regression and linear mixed-effects random-intercept models. Moreover, the linear mixed-effects random-intercept models showed better fit indices compared to linear regression mega-analytical models. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that results obtained by meta- and mega-analysis differ, in favor of the latter. In multi-center studies with a moderate amount of variation between cohorts, a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analytical framework appears to be the better approach to investigate structural neuroimaging data.", "Keywords": ["IPD meta-analysis", "MRI", "linear mixed-effect models", "mega-analysis", "neuroimaging"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Premika S W",

The extent or severity of extremes of eating and state of illness, which are often associated with differences in, for instance hormonal status, comorbidity, and medication use, commonly differ between studies and likely add to variation across study results. Those effects are in addition to the well-described problems arising from differences in task designs, data quality control procedures, image data preprocessing and analysis or statistical thresholds applied across studies.

The BN samples differed in the severity of their clinical presentation, illness duration and age. Multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPAs) based on machine learning were used to determine whether patterns of fronto-striatal activation characterized adolescents with BN spectrum disorders regardless of clinical severity, and whether accurate classification of less symptomatic adolescents (subthreshold BN; SBN) could be achieved based on patterns of activation in adolescents who met DSM5 criteria for BN. MVPA classification analyses revealed that both BN and SBN adolescents could be accurately discriminated from healthy adolescents based on fronto-striatal activation. Notably, the patterns detected in more severely ill BN compared with healthy adolescents accurately discriminated less symptomatic SBN from healthy adolescents. Deficient activation of fronto-striatal circuits can characterize BN early in its course, when clinical presentations are less severe, perhaps pointing to circuit-based disturbances as useful biomarker or risk factor for the disorder, and a tool for understanding its developmental trajectory, as well as the development of early interventions.", "Keywords": ["Bulimia Nervosa", "Simon task", "adolescents", "conflict resolution", "fronto-striatal circuits", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "machine learning", "multi-voxel pattern analysis", "self-regulatory control"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain Mapping", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Conflict, Psychological", "Corpus Striatum", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Motor Activity", "Neural Pathways", "Reaction Time", "Severity of Illness Index", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marilyn", "Last Name": "Cyr", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "The Division of Translational Imaging, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Human brain mapping", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "29148122", "Title": "Altered frontal interhemispheric and fronto-limbic structural connectivity in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have primarily used voxel- or tract-based methods to assess white matter microstructure in medicated patients.

Given the role of the amygdala in anxiety, we assessed resting state functional connectivity of amygdalar subregions in children with RD to identify functional correlates of anxiety and reading impairment. We collected resting state functional MRI data from 22 children with RD and 21 typically developing (TD) children, ages 7 to 13 years. We assessed group differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) from amygdalar subregions. Associations of amygdalar RSFC and volume with reading impairment, reading fluency scores, and anxiety symptoms were explored. Relative to TD children, those with RD showed increased RSFC from amygdalar nuclei to medial prefrontal cortex. Across all subjects, RSFC from right centromedial amygdala to left medial prefrontal cortex positively predicted both reading impairment and self-reported anxiety, and anxiety mediated the relationship between RSFC and reading impairment. These findings are consistent with amygdalar functional abnormalities in pediatric anxiety disorders, suggesting a common neurobiological mechanism underlying anxiety and reading impairment in children. Thus, aberrant patterns of RSFC from amygdalar subregions may serve as potential targets for the treatment of anxiety symptoms that typically co-occur with RD.

Previous data from healthy individuals suggest that the magnitude of the difference between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) scores (the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy) is associated with reduced thickness in frontal and parietal cortices (inferior frontal, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus) that support cognitive control. Unknown is whether the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy is associated with functional deficits in these areas in healthy or ill children and adolescents. We assessed the effects of the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy on fMRI BOLD response during the resolution of cognitive conflict in 55 healthy children and adolescents during performance of a Simon Spatial Incompatibility task. As the magnitude of the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy increased, activation of fronto-striatal, limbic, and temporal regions decreased during conflict resolution (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, corrected). In exploratory analyses, the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy was associated with reduced functional connectivity from right inferior frontal gyrus to right thalamus and increased functional connectivity to right supramarginal gyrus (ps\u00a0<\u00a0.03, uncorrected). The VIQ>PIQ discrepancy may be an important aspect of an individual's cognitive profile and likely contributes to, or is associated with, deficient cognitive control processes characteristic of many childhood disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Child", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence Tests", "Learning Disabilities", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Physical Functional Performance", "Verbal Learning", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katie S", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa S", "Last Name": "Pao", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Tau", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guihu", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhishun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Developmental science", "PubDate": "2018Mar"}, {"PMID": "27806864", "Title": "Reward-Based Spatial Learning in Teens With Bulimia Nervosa.", "Abstract": "To assess the functioning of mesolimbic and fronto-striatal areas involved in reward-based spatial learning in teenaged girls with bulimia nervosa (BN) that\u00a0might be involved in the development and maintenance of maladaptive behaviors characteristic of the disorder.", "Keywords": ["bulimia nervosa", "fMRI", "learning", "reward", "virtual reality"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neostriatum", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reward", "Spatial Learning"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marilyn", "Last Name": "Cyr", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zhishun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Imaging, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Gregory Z", "Last Name": "Tau", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guihu", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York;

In unmedicated adults with OCD (n\u2009=\u200930) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200932), they used resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to examine functional connectivity between two neural networks associated with attentional processes: the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN). They then used path analyses to examine putative relationships across three variables of interest: DMN-SN connectivity, attention, and OCD symptoms. In the OCD compared with healthy control participants, there was significantly reduced inverse connectivity between the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) and the anterior insular cortex, regions within the DMN and SN, respectively. In OCD, reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity was associated with both increased OCD symptom severity and decreased sustained attention. Path analyses were consistent with a potential mechanistic explanation: OCD symptoms are associated with an imbalance in DMN-SN networks that subserve attentional processes and this effect of OCD on DMN-SN connectivity is associated with decreased sustained attention. This work builds upon a growing literature suggesting that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity may represent a trans-diagnostic marker of attentional processes and suggests a potential mechanistic account of the relationship between OCD and attention. Reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity may be an important target for treatment development to improve attention in individuals with OCD.

Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behaviour, such as spatial learning and memory. Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behaviour; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to T-cell-derived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social behaviour and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-\u03b3 and increase GABAergic (\u03b3-aminobutyric-acid) currents in projection neurons, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behaviour. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of a range of organisms reveals that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFN-\u03b3/JAK-STAT-dependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the IFN-\u03b3 signalling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link between social/aggregation behaviour and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-\u03b3, in disorders characterized by social dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between social behaviour and an anti-pathogen immune response driven by IFN-\u03b3 signalling.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Female", "GABAergic Neurons", "Interferon-gamma", "Male", "Meninges", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Pathways", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Rats", "Signal Transduction", "Social Behavior", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Filiano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Tustison", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Smirnov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher C", "Last Name": "Overall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sachin P", "Last Name": "Gadani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhiping", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sayeda Najamussahar", "Last Name": "Peerzade", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Scott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark P", "Last Name": "Beenhakker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vladimir", "Last Name": "Litvak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Kipnis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2016Jul21"}, {"PMID": "27000310", "Title": "Sex-specific neural activity when resolving cognitive interference in individuals with or without prior internalizing disorders.", "Abstract": "The processing of cognitive interference is a self-regulatory capacity that is impaired in persons with internalizing disorders. This investigation was to assess sex differences in the neural correlates of cognitive interference in individuals with and without an illness history of an internalizing disorder. We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygenation-level-dependent responses in both males (n=63) and females (n=80) with and without this illness history during performance of the Simon task. Females deactivated superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and posterior cingulate cortex to a greater extent than males. Females with a prior history of internalizing disorder also deactivated these regions more compared to males with that history, and they additionally demonstrated greater activation of right inferior frontal gyrus. These group differences were represented in a significant sex-by-illness interaction in these regions. These deactivated regions compose a task-negative or default mode network, whereas the inferior frontal gyrus usually activates when performing an attention-demanding task and is a key component of a task-positive network.

Dorsal striatal-dependent habit memory may in part influence the development and expression of some human psychopathologies, particularly those characterized by strong habit-like behavioral features. The present review considers this hypothesis as it pertains to psychopathologies that typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. These disorders include Tourette syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. Human and nonhuman animal research shows that the typical development of memory systems comprises the early maturation of striatal-dependent habit memory and the relatively late maturation of hippocampal-dependent cognitive memory. We speculate that the differing rates of development of these memory systems may in part contribute to the early emergence of habit-like symptoms in childhood and adolescence. In addition, abnormalities in hippocampal and striatal brain regions have been observed consistently in youth with these disorders, suggesting that the aberrant development of memory systems may also contribute to the emergence of habit-like symptoms as core pathological features of these illnesses.

The functioning of the brain circuits for episodic memory or learning that support goal-directed behavior has not been studied previously in persons with cocaine dependence (CD). Thirteen abstinent CD and 13 healthy participants underwent MRI scanning while performing a task that requires the use of spatial cues to navigate a virtual-reality environment and find monetary rewards, allowing the functional assessment of the brain systems for spatial learning, a form of episodic memory. Whereas both groups performed similarly on the reward-based spatial learning task, we identified disturbances in brain regions involved in learning and reward in CD participants. In particular, CD was associated with impaired functioning of medial temporal lobe (MTL), a brain region that is crucial for spatial learning (and episodic memory) with concomitant recruitment of striatum (which normally participates in stimulus-response, or habit, learning), and prefrontal cortex. CD was also associated with enhanced sensitivity of the ventral striatum to unexpected rewards but not to expected rewards earned during spatial learning. We provide evidence that spatial learning in CD is characterized by disturbances in functioning of an MTL-based system for episodic memory and a striatum-based system for stimulus-response learning and reward. We have found additional abnormalities in distributed cortical regions. Consistent with findings from animal studies, we provide the first evidence in humans describing the disruptive effects of cocaine on the coordinated functioning of multiple neural systems for learning and memory.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cocaine-Related Disorders", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Learning Disabilities", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxygen", "Reward", "Space Perception", "Statistics as Topic", "User-Computer Interface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gregory Z", "Last Name": "Tau", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhishun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Torres-Sanchez", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara", "Last Name": "Graniello", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongrong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark G", "Last Name": "Packard", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yunsuo", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alayar", "Last Name": "Kangarlu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diana", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA [2] Division on Substance Abuse, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bradley S", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23489416", "Title": "Altered activation in fronto-striatal circuits during sequential processing of conflict in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the functioning of fronto-striatal brain circuits that support self-regulatory capacities including conflict resolution and sequential processing in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).", "Keywords": ["Cognitive conflict", "Simon task", "fMRI", "fronto-striatal systems", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "self-regulation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Attention", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Corpus Striatum", "Executive Function", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.
