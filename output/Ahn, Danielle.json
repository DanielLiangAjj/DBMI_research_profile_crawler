Ineffective antimicrobial activity by these last resort therapeutics can occur by transfer of mcr-1, a plasmid-mediated resistance gene, causing modification of the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and disruption of the interactions between polymyxins and lipid A. Whether this modification alters the innate host immune response or carries a high fitness cost in the bacteria is not well established. To investigate this, we studied infection with K. pneumoniae (KP) ATCC 13883 harboring either the mcr-1 plasmid (pmcr-1) or the vector control (pBCSK) ATCC 13883. Bacterial fitness characteristics of mcr-1 acquisition were evaluated. Differentiated human monocytes (THP-1s) were stimulated with KP bacterial strains or purified LPS from both parent isolates and isolates harboring mcr-1. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for cytokine production. A bacterial pneumonia model in WT C57/BL6J mice was used to monitor immune cell recruitment, cytokine induction, and bacterial clearance in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolates harboring mcr-1 had increased colistin MIC compared to the parent isolates but did not alter bacterial fitness. Few differences in cytokines were observed with purified LPS from mcr-1 expressing bacteria in vitro. However, in a mouse pneumonia model, no bacterial clearance defect was observed between pmcr-1-harboring KP and parent isolates. Consistently, no differences in cytokine production or immune cell recruitment in the BALF were observed, suggesting that other mechanisms outweigh the effect of these lipid A mutations in LPS.", "Keywords": ["Klebsiella pneumoniae", "antimicrobial resistance", "carbapenem resistance", "colistin", "colistin resistance", "host immune response", "lipid A", "mcr-1", "polymyxin", "pulmonary infection"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Colistin", "Lipid A", "Immunity, Innate", "Mice", "Klebsiella Infections", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Pneumonia, Bacterial", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Cytokines", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Female"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gitanjali", "Last Name": "Bhushan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Castano", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Wong Fok Lung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Chandler", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, University of Maryland, School of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas H", "Last Name": "McConville", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert K", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, University of Maryland, School of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice S", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Infection and immunity", "PubDate": "2024Jun11"}, {"PMID": "37793346", "Title": "Ketogenesis promotes tolerance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection.", "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pulmonary infection.

Neutrophils are major host mediators, able to kill well-studied and antibiotic-sensitive laboratory reference strains of K. pneumoniae. However, CRKP-ST258 are able to evade neutrophil phagocytic killing, persisting longer in the host despite robust neutrophil recruitment. Here, we show that neutrophils are unable to clear a CRKP-ST258 isolate (KP35). Compared to the response elicited by a prototypic K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (KPPR1), the neutrophil intracellular response against KP35 is characterized by equivalent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase content, but impaired phagosomal acidification. Our results ruled out that this phenomenon is due to a phagocytosis defect, as we observed similar efficiency of phagocytosis by neutrophils infected with KP35 or KPPR1. Genomic analysis of the cps loci of KPPR1 and KP35 suggest that the capsule composition of KP35 explain the high phagocytosis efficiency by neutrophils. Consistent with other reports, we show that KP35 did not induce DNA release by neutrophils and KPPR1 only induced it at 3\u00a0h, when most of the bacteria have already been cleared. l-arginine metabolism has been identified as an important modulator of the host immune response and positively regulate T cells, macrophages and neutrophils in response to microbes. Our data show that l-arginine supplementation improved phagosome acidification, increased ROS production and enhanced nitric oxide consumption by neutrophils in response to KP35. The enhanced intracellular response observed after l-arginine supplementation ultimately improved KP35 clearance in vitro. KP35 was able to dysregulate the intracellular microbicidal machinery of neutrophils to survive in the intracellular environment.

The authors anticipate that developing evidence-informed and institution-specific guidelines will lead to improvements in care quality, efficiency, and consistency; minimization of staff risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and increased provider comfort in caring for pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Child", "Child Welfare", "Coronavirus Infections", "Critical Pathways", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Disease Management", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Patient Care Team", "Pneumonia, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebekah", "Last Name": "Diamond", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and rcd2143@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Avital", "Last Name": "Fischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Hooe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Taylor B", "Last Name": "Sewell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Schweickert", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Nazreen", "Last Name": "Jamal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Zachariah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wanda", "Last Name": "Abreu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Mirna", "Last Name": "Giordano", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}], "Journal": "Hospital pediatrics", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32637365", "Title": "Participation of the IL-10RB Related Cytokines, IL-22 and IFN-\u03bb in Defense of the Airway Mucosal Barrier.", "Abstract": "The airway epithelial barrier is a major barrier protecting against clinically significant infections of the lung. Its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes, biofilm formation, and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes. Enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interferon-\u03bb (IFN-\u03bb), members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. These cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor IL-10RB, have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense. They are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections, but with differing kinetics. IL-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides, upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17. Conversely, IFN-\u03bb, a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties, appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation. The effects of these cytokines are pleotropic, with pathogen and tissue specific consequences. Understanding how these cytokines work in the mucosal defenses of the respiratory system may suggest potential targets to prevent invasive infections of the damaged lung.", "Keywords": ["ESKAPE pathogens", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Staphylococcus aureus", "coronavirus", "influenza", "mucosal barriers", "respiratory epithelial barrier"], "MeSH terms": ["Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Influenza, Human", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-10 Receptor beta Subunit", "Interleukins", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Tight Junctions", "Interleukin-22"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32505742", "Title": "Gastrointestinal Symptoms as a Major Presentation Component of a Novel Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children That Is Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Single Center Experience of 44 Cases.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Gastrointestinal", "MIS-C", "Pediatrics"], "MeSH terms": ["Abdominal Pain", "Betacoronavirus", "Blood Sedimentation", "C-Reactive Protein", "COVID-19", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coronavirus Infections", "Diarrhea", "Female", "Fever", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nausea", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Retrospective Studies", "SARS-CoV-2", "Serum Albumin", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "Vomiting"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Cantor", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Zachariah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kara Gross", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.

In this study, we show that P.\u00a0aeruginosa can exploit the host immune response to maintain infection. Notably, unlike other opportunistic bacteria, we found that P.\u00a0aeruginosa alters its metabolic and immunostimulatory properties in response to itaconate, an abundant host-derived immunometabolite in the infected lung. Itaconate induces bacterial membrane stress, resulting in downregulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and upregulation of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These itaconate-adapted P.\u00a0aeruginosa accumulate lptD mutations, which favor itaconate assimilation and biofilm formation. EPS, in turn, induces itaconate production by myeloid cells, both in the airway and systemically, skewing the host immune response to one permissive of chronic infection.

Importantly, intranasal transfer of bone marrow-derived M-MDSCs from mice able to produce IL-10 at 1 day prior to infection improved the ability of IL-10-/- mice to clear KP35 in the lungs, decreasing their mortality.

We postulated that IFN-\u03bb plays a role in regulating the airway epithelial barrier to facilitate cellular trafficking to the site of infection. In response to IFN-\u03bb, the transmigration of neutrophils across a polarized monolayer of airway epithelial cells was increased, consistent with diminished epithelial integrity. KP35 infection increased epithelial permeability, and pretreatment with IFN-\u03bb amplified this effect and facilitated bacterial transmigration. These effects of IFN-\u03bb were confirmed in vivo, in that mice lacking the receptor for IFN-\u03bb (Ifnlr1-/-) were protected from bacteremia in a murine model of KP35 pneumonia. Conversely, the integrity of the epithelial barrier was protected by IL-22, with subsequent impairment of neutrophil and bacterial transmigration in vitro.

This comprehensive analysis of an ST258 K. pneumoniae isolate reveals ongoing genetic adaptation to host microenvironments and innate immune clearance mechanisms that complements its repertoire of antimicrobial resistance genes and facilitates persistence in the lung.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Transport Systems", "Animals", "Antiporters", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cytokines", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Monocytes", "Neutrophils", "Phagocytosis", "Pneumonia, Bacterial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hern\u00e1n", "Last Name": "Pe\u00f1aloza", "Affiliation": "Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Wickersham", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dane", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Purvi", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Proteomics Shared Resource at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonius", "Last Name": "Koller", "Affiliation": "Proteomics Shared Resource at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily I", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Proteomics Shared Resource at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan M", "Last Name": "Bueno", "Affiliation": "Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2016Oct20"}, {"PMID": "26582515", "Title": "Innate Immune Signaling Activated by MDR Bacteria in the Airway.", "Abstract": "Health care-associated bacterial pneumonias due to multiple-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens are an important public health problem and are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition to antimicrobial resistance, these organisms have adapted to the milieu of the human airway and have acquired resistance to the innate immune clearance mechanisms that normally prevent pneumonia. Given the limited efficacy of antibiotics, bacterial clearance from the airway requires an effective immune response. Understanding how specific airway pathogens initiate and regulate innate immune signaling, and whether this response is excessive, leading to host-induced pathology may guide future immunomodulatory therapy. We will focus on three of the most important causes of health care-associated pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and review the mechanisms through which an inappropriate or damaging innate immune response is stimulated, as well as describe how airway pathogens cause persistent infection by evading immune activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Cross Infection", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Factors", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Lung", "Pneumonia, Bacterial", "Pseudomonas Infections", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dane", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Taylor", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Physiological reviews", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "25880560", "Title": "Toxin-induced necroptosis is a major mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus lung damage.", "Abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus USA300 strains cause a highly inflammatory necrotizing pneumonia. The virulence of this strain has been attributed to its expression of multiple toxins that have diverse targets including ADAM10, NLRP3 and CD11b. We demonstrate that induction of necroptosis through RIP1/RIP3/MLKL signaling is a major consequence of S. aureus toxin production. Cytotoxicity could be prevented by inhibiting either RIP1 or MLKL signaling and S. aureus mutants lacking agr, hla or Hla pore formation, lukAB or psms were deficient in inducing cell death in human and murine immune cells. Toxin-associated pore formation was essential, as cell death was blocked by exogenous K+ or dextran. MLKL inhibition also blocked caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 production, suggesting a link to the inflammasome. Rip3(-/-) mice exhibited significantly improved staphylococcal clearance and retained an alveolar macrophage population with CD200R and CD206 markers in the setting of acute infection, suggesting increased susceptibility of these leukocytes to necroptosis. The importance of this anti-inflammatory signaling was indicated by the correlation between improved outcome and significantly decreased expression of KC, IL-6, TNF, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in infected mice. These findings indicate that toxin-induced necroptosis is a major cause of lung pathology in S. aureus pneumonia and suggest the possibility of targeting components of this signaling pathway as a therapeutic strategy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bacterial Toxins", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Line", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Inflammasomes", "Macrophages, Alveolar", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Necrosis", "Pneumonia, Staphylococcal", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kipyegon", "Last Name": "Kitur", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dane", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Nieto", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Danielle S", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Taylor S", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Wachtel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Bueno", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America; Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}]
