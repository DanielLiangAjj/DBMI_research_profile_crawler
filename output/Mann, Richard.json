While intercellular DIP/Dpr interactions have been well characterized, DIPs and Dprs are often co-expressed within the same cells, raising the question as to whether they also interact in cis . We show, in cultured cells and in vivo, that DIP-\u03b1 and DIP-\u03b4 can interact in cis with their ligands, Dpr6/10 and Dpr12, respectively. When co-expressed in cis with their cognate partners, these Dprs regulate the extent of trans binding, presumably through competitive cis interactions. We demonstrate the neurodevelopmental effects of cis inhibition in fly motor neurons and in the mushroom body. We further show that a long disordered region of DIP-\u03b1 at the C-terminus is required for cis but not trans interactions, likely because it alleviates geometric constraints on cis binding. Thus, the balance between cis and trans interactions plays a role in controlling neural development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Morano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davys H", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hagar", "Last Name": "Meltzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alina P", "Last Name": "Sergeeva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin D", "Last Name": "Rostam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Himanshu Pawankumar", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan E", "Last Name": "Becker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bavat", "Last Name": "Bornstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Filip", "Last Name": "Cosmanescu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oren", "Last Name": "Schuldiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun06"}, {"PMID": "38630721", "Title": "Collective behavior from surprise minimization.", "Abstract": "Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature; groups of animals, such as fish, birds, and ungulates appear to move as a whole, exhibiting a rich behavioral repertoire that ranges from directed movement to milling to disordered swarming. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local interactions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school). Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled particles, subject to self-generated motion and \"social forces\" such as short-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However, organisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we introduce an approach to modeling collective behavior based on active inference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many empirically observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling, and directed motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference-without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring the parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal nontrivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective decision-making accuracy.

This technique combines two highly efficient and robust procedures: phiC31 integrase-mediated site-specific integration and homing endonuclease-mediated resolution of local duplications. In this technique, a donor fragment containing the desired mutation(s) is first integrated into a selected attP site near the target locus by phiC31 integrase-mediated site-specific integration, which creates local duplications consisting of the mutant-containing donor fragment and the wild-type target locus. Next, homing endonuclease-induced double-stranded DNA breaks trigger recombination between the duplications and resolve the target locus to generate scarless mutant alleles. In every step, the desired flies can be easily identified by patterns of dominant markers, so no large-scale screens are needed. This technique is highly efficient and can be used to generate scarless point mutations, insertions, and deletions. The availability of large libraries of mapped attP site-containing transposon/CRISPR insertions in Drosophila allows the modification of more than half of the euchromatic Drosophila genome at a high efficiency. As more and more attP-containing insertions are generated and mapped, this technique will be able to modify larger portions of the Drosophila genome.

In other words, both processes are optimized at the same time, and optimal decision-making processes are only understood in the light of movement constraints. To fully understand the rationale of decisions embedded in an environment (and therefore the underlying evolutionary processes), it is instrumental to develop theories of spatial decision-making. Here, we present a framework specifically developed to address this issue by the means of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. Specifically, we investigate a simple task in which single agents need to learn to explore their square arena without leaving its boundaries. We show that agents evolve by developing increasingly optimal strategies to solve a spatially embedded learning task while not having an initial arbitrary model of movements. The process allows the agents to learn how to move (i.e. by avoiding the arena walls) in order to make increasingly optimal decisions (improving their exploration of the arena).

One drawback of ChIP-based techniques is the lack of cell type-specificity when profiling complex tissues. To overcome this limitation, we developed SpyChIP to identify cell type-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites in native physiological contexts without tissue dissociation or nuclei sorting. SpyChIP takes advantage of a specific covalent isopeptide bond that rapidly forms between the 15-amino acid SpyTag and the 17-kDa protein SpyCatcher. In SpyChIP, the target TF is fused with SpyTag by genome engineering, and an epitope tagged SpyCatcher is expressed in cell populations of interest, where it covalently binds to SpyTag-TF. Cell type-specific ChIP is obtained by immunoprecipitating chromatin prepared from whole tissues using antibodies directed against the epitope-tagged SpyCatcher. Using SpyChIP, we identified the genome-wide binding profiles of the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in two distinct cell types of the Drosophila haltere imaginal disc. Our results revealed extensive region-specific Ubx-DNA binding events, highlighting the significance of cell type-specific ChIP and the limitations of whole-tissue ChIP approaches. Analysis of Ubx::SpyChIP results provided insights into the relationship between chromatin accessibility and Ubx-DNA binding, as well as different mechanisms Ubx employs to regulate its downstream cis-regulatory modules.

Yet previous modeling work on agent learning and decision-making either lacks a systematic way to describe this source of uncertainty or puts the focus on obtaining optimal policies using complex models of the world that would impose an unrealistically high cognitive demand on real agents. In this work we aim to efficiently describe the emergent behavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with partially observable worlds. Therefore we derive and present deterministic reinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the environment only partially. We showcase the broad applicability of our dynamics across different classes of partially observable agent-environment systems. We find that partial observability creates unintuitive benefits in several specific contexts, pointing the way to further research on a general understanding of such effects. For instance, partially observant agents can learn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way, and even overcome social dilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems theory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the emergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning processes between reward regimes, and the separation of the learning dynamics into fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability.

To specify segment identity, we show that Ubx both increases and decreases chromatin accessibility, coinciding with its dual role as both an activator and repressor of transcription. However, the choice of transcriptional activity executed by Ubx is spatially regulated and depends on the availability of cofactors, with Ubx acting as a repressor in some populations and as an activator in others.

Each PR expresses photosensitive opsins, which are activated by a particular wavelength of light. In most insects, the visual system comprises a pair of compound eyes that are mainly associated with motion, color or polarized light detection, and a triplet of ocelli that are thought to be critical during flight to detect horizon and movements. It is widely believed that the evolutionary diversification of compound eye and ocelli in insects occurred from an ancestral visual organ around 500 million years ago. Concurrently, opsin genes were also duplicated to provide distinct spectral sensitivities to different PRs of compound eye and ocelli. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Rhodopsin1 (Rh1) and Rh2 are closely related opsins that originated from the duplication of a single ancestral gene. However, in the visual organs, Rh2 is uniquely expressed in ocelli whereas Rh1 is uniquely expressed in outer PRs of the compound eye. It is currently unknown how this differential expression of Rh1 and Rh2 in the two visual organs is controlled to provide unique spectral sensitivities to ocelli and compound eyes. Here, we show that Homothorax (Hth) is expressed in ocelli and confers proper rhodopsin expression. We find that Hth controls a binary Rhodopsin switch in ocelli to promote Rh2 expression and repress Rh1 expression. Genetic and molecular analysis of rh1 and rh2 supports that Hth acts through their promoters to regulate Rhodopsin expression in the ocelli. Finally, we also show that when ectopically expressed in the retina, hth is sufficient to induce Rh2 expression only at the outer PRs in a cell autonomous manner. We therefore propose that the diversification of rhodpsins in the ocelli and retinal outer PRs occurred by duplication of an ancestral gene, which is under the control of Homothorax.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Membrane Proteins", "Ocular Physiological Phenomena", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Retina", "Rhodopsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abhishek Kumar", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Cornelia", "Last Name": "Fritsch", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Roumen", "Last Name": "Voutev", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience, Mortimer B.

As such, animals may rely on simpler social information, which will affect the social behaviour they exhibit. Here, I derive the optimal policy for agents responding to simplified forms of social information. I show how the behaviour of agents attending to the aggregate number of previous choices differs from those attending to just the most recent prior decision, and I propose a hybrid strategy that provides a highly accurate approximation to the optimal policy with the full sequence. Finally, I analyse the evolutionary stability of each strategy, showing that the hybrid strategy dominates when cognitive costs are low but non-zero, while attending to the most recent decision is dominant when costs are high.

The existence of individual differences that have implications for collective behaviour raises important questions. How are these differences generated and maintained? Are individual differences driven by exogenous factors, or are they a response to the social dilemmas these groups face? Here I consider the classic case of patch selection by foraging agents under conditions of social competition. I introduce a multilevel model wherein the perceptual sensitivities of agents evolve in response to their foraging success or failure over repeated patch selections. This model reveals a bifurcation in the population, creating a class of agents with no perceptual sensitivity. These agents exploit the social environment to avoid the costs of accurate perception, relying on other agents to make fitness rewards insensitive to the choice of foraging patch. This provides a individual-based evolutionary basis for models incorporating perceptual limits that have been proposed to explain observed deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) in empirical studies, while showing that the common assumption in such models that agents share identical sensory limits is likely false. Further analysis of the model shows how agents develop perceptual strategic niches in response to environmental variability.

Both binary ON/OFF regulation of transcription, as well as more fine-tuned control of transcription levels in the ON state, are required to define cell types. The Drosophila melanogaster Hox gene, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), exhibits both of these modes of control during development. While ON/OFF regulation is needed to specify the fate of the developing wing (Ubx OFF) and haltere (Ubx ON), the levels of Ubx within the haltere differ between compartments along the proximal-distal axis. Here, we identify and molecularly dissect the novel contribution of a previously identified Ubx cis-regulatory module (CRM), anterobithorax (abx), to a negative auto-regulatory loop that decreases Ubx expression in the proximal compartment of the haltere as compared to the distal compartment. We find that Ubx, in complex with the known Hox cofactors, Homothorax (Hth) and Extradenticle (Exd), acts through low-affinity Ubx-Exd binding sites to reduce the levels of Ubx transcription in the proximal compartment. Importantly, we also reveal that Ubx-Exd-binding site mutations sufficient to result in de-repression of abx activity in a transgenic context are not sufficient to de-repress Ubx expression when mutated at the endogenous locus, suggesting the presence of multiple mechanisms through which Ubx-mediated repression occurs.

Additionally, we find that similar regulation can be achieved by Amphioxus orthologs, suggesting these three mechanisms are conserved from insects to chordates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Embryonic Development", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genes, Homeobox", "Genes, Insect", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Higueras", "Affiliation": "Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo (CSIC/JA/UPO), Universidad Pablo de Olavide, 41013, Seville, Spain. csanhig@upo.es."}, {"First Name": "Chaitanya", "Last Name": "Rastogi", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biological Sciences and Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roumen", "Last Name": "Voutev", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Neuroscience, Mortimer B.

The cell partly resolves this specificity paradox through combinatorial strategies and the use of low-affinity binding sites, which are better able to distinguish between similar TFs. However, because these sites have low affinity, it is challenging to understand how TFs recognize them in vivo. Here, we summarize recent findings and technological advancements that allow for the quantification and mechanistic interpretation of TF recognition across a wide range of affinities. We propose a model that integrates insights from the fields of genetics and cell biology to provide further conceptual understanding of TF binding specificity.

Motor neurons (MNs), key components of these circuits, project their axons from the central nervous system and form precise terminal branching patterns at specific muscles.

The DIP-\u03b1/Dpr10 interaction is needed only after MN axons reach the vicinity of their muscle targets. Live imaging suggests that precise terminal branching patterns are gradually established by DIP-\u03b1/Dpr10-dependent interactions between fine axon filopodia and developing muscles.

Yet despite its importance, there is still debate about its evolutionary origins. Two main hypotheses have been proposed: the paranotal hypothesis, which suggests that wings evolved as an extension of the dorsal thorax, and the gill-exite hypothesis, which proposes that wings were derived from a modification of a pre-existing branch at the dorsal base (subcoxa) of the leg. Here, we address this question by studying how wing fates are initially specified during Drosophila embryogenesis, by characterizing a cis-regulatory module (CRM) from the snail (sna) gene, sna-DP (for dorsal primordia). sna-DP specifically marks the early primordia for both the wing and haltere, collectively referred to as the DP. We found that the inputs that activate sna-DP are distinct from those that activate Distalless, a marker for leg fates. Further, in genetic backgrounds in which the leg primordia are absent, the DP are still partially specified. However, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that cells from the early leg primordia contribute to both ventral and dorsal appendage fates. Together, these results suggest that the wings of Drosophila have a dual developmental origin: two groups of cells, one ventral and one more dorsal, give rise to the mature wing. We suggest that the dual developmental origins of the wing may be a molecular remnant of the evolutionary history of this appendage, in which cells of the subcoxa of the leg coalesced with dorsal outgrowths to evolve a dorsal appendage with motor control.", "Keywords": ["Decapentaplegic", "Distalless", "Drosophila development", "Wingless", "appendage development", "haltere primordia", "insect wing evolution", "leg primordia", "snail", "wing primordia"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Snail Family Transcription Factors", "Wings, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Requena", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular and Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas-Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jose Andres", "Last Name": "\u00c1lvarez", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda and Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas-Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Hugo", "Last Name": "Gabilondo", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular and Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas-Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Loker", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Systems Biology, Mortimer B.

Besides hydrogen bonding in the major groove (base readout), proteins recognize minor-groove geometry using positively charged amino acids (shape readout). The underlying mechanism of DNA shape readout involves the correlation between minor-groove width and electrostatic potential (EP). To probe this biophysical effect directly, rather than using minor-groove width as an indirect measure for shape readout, we developed a methodology, DNAphi, for predicting EP in the minor groove and confirmed the direct role of EP in protein-DNA binding using massive sequencing data. The DNAphi method uses a sliding-window approach to mine results from non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations on DNA structures derived from all-atom Monte Carlo simulations.

This problem has previously only been used to study organisms with brains, yet here we demonstrate that a brainless unicellular organism compares the relative qualities of multiple options, integrates over repeated samplings to perform well in random environments, and combines information on reward frequency and magnitude in order to make correct and adaptive decisions. We extend our inquiry by using Bayesian model selection to determine the most likely algorithm used by the cell when making decisions. We deduce that this algorithm centres around a tendency to exploit environments in proportion to their reward experienced through past sampling. The algorithm is intermediate in computational complexity between simple, reactionary heuristics and calculation-intensive optimal performance algorithms, yet it has very good relative performance.

Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximize their future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group and that this cohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the distribution of the number of possible future paths. We derive social interaction rules that are consistent with maximum entropy group behaviour for both discrete and continuous decision spaces.

Traditionally, these models were built based on nucleotide sequence. Here, we integrated 3D DNA shape information derived with a high-throughput approach into the modeling of TF binding specificities. Using support vector regression, we trained quantitative models of TF binding specificity based on protein binding microarray (PBM) data for 68 mammalian TFs.

Although both k-mer and DNA shape features can encode interdependencies between nucleotide positions of the binding site, using DNA shape features reduced the dimensionality of the feature space.

Neuronal programs must be sufficiently flexible to the locomotive challenges inherent in different environments. Although insect studies have contributed substantially to the identification of the components and rules that determine locomotion, we still lack an understanding of how multi-jointed walking insects respond to changes in walking orientation and direction and strength of the gravitational force. In order to answer these questions we measured with high temporal and spatial resolution the kinematic properties of untethered Drosophila during inverted and vertical walking. In addition, we also examined the kinematic responses to increases in gravitational load. We find that animals are capable of shifting their step, spatial and inter-leg parameters in order to cope with more challenging walking conditions. For example, flies walking in an inverted orientation decreased the duration of their swing phase leading to increased contact with the substrate and, as a result, greater stability. We also find that when flies carry additional weight, thereby increasing their gravitational load, some changes in step parameters vary over time, providing evidence for adaptation. However, above a threshold that is between 1 and 2 times their body weight flies display locomotion parameters that suggest they are no longer capable of walking in a coordinated manner.

Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91\u2008576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.", "Keywords": ["Cyanistes caeruleus", "Paridae", "Parus major", "collective behaviour", "decision making", "interspecific interaction", "mixed-species flocking", "social information use"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Damien R", "Last Name": "Farine", "Affiliation": "Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, U.K. ; Department of Anthropology, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, U.S.A. ; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Ancon, Panama."}, {"First Name": "Lucy M", "Last Name": "Aplin", "Affiliation": "Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, U.K. ; Research School of Biology (Division of Ecology, Evolution and Genetics), Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Colin J", "Last Name": "Garroway", "Affiliation": "Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Ben C", "Last Name": "Sheldon", "Affiliation": "Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, U.K."}], "Journal": "Animal behaviour", "PubDate": "2014Sep"}, {"PMID": "25165603", "Title": "Solving the shepherding problem: heuristics for herding autonomous, interacting agents.", "Abstract": "Herding of sheep by dogs is a powerful example of one individual causing many unwilling individuals to move in the same direction.

Recent studies have suggested that individual-level personality traits influence the degree to which individuals use social information, are attracted to conspecifics, or act as leaders/followers. However, evidence is equivocal and largely limited to laboratory studies. We use an automated data-collection system to conduct an experiment testing the relationship between personality and collective decision-making in the wild. First, we report that foraging flocks of great tits (Parus major) show strikingly synchronous behaviour. A predictive model of collective decision-making replicates patterns well, suggesting simple interaction rules are sufficient to explain the observed social behaviour. Second, within groups, individuals with more reactive personalities behave more collectively, moving to within-flock areas of higher density. By contrast, proactive individuals tend to move to and feed at spatial periphery of flocks. Finally, comparing alternative simulations of flocking with empirical data, we demonstrate that variation in personality promotes within-patch movement while maintaining group cohesion.

Binding events common to the eye and wing are also present for Sd and Hth; these are associated with genes regulating cell proliferation and \"housekeeping\" functions, and account for the majority of Yki binding. In contrast, tissue-specific binding events for Sd and Hth significantly overlap enhancers that are active in the given tissue, are enriched in Sd and Hth DNA binding sites, respectively, and are associated with genes that are consistent with each factor's previously established tissue-specific functions. Tissue-specific binding events are also significantly associated with Polycomb targeted chromatin domains. To provide mechanistic insights into tissue-specific regulation, we identify and characterize eye and wing enhancers of the Yki-targeted bantam microRNA gene and demonstrate that they are dependent on direct binding by Hth and Sd, respectively. Overall these results suggest that both Sd and Hth use distinct strategies - one shared between tissues and associated with Yki, the other tissue-specific, generally Yki-independent and associated with developmental patterning - to regulate distinct gene sets during development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Chromatin", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Eye", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Organ Specificity", "Signal Transduction", "Trans-Activators", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Wings, Animal", "YAP-Signaling Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Slattery", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America ; Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology and Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Roumen", "Last Name": "Voutev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lijia", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "N\u00e8gre", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin P", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23898161", "Title": "Ant colonies outperform individuals when a sensory discrimination task is difficult but not when it is easy.", "Abstract": "\"Collective intelligence\" and \"wisdom of crowds\" refer to situations in which groups achieve more accurate perception and better decisions than solitary agents.

We decoded the regulatory information that controls the expression of five enzymes and transporters that define the terminal identity of all eight dopaminergic neurons in the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite. We show that the tightly coordinated, robust expression of these dopaminergic enzymes and transporters (\"dopamine pathway\") is ensured through a combinatorial cis-regulatory signature that is shared by all dopamine pathway genes. This signature is composed of an Ets domain-binding site, recognized by the previously described AST-1 Ets domain factor, and two distinct types of homeodomain-binding sites that act in a partially redundant manner. Through genetic screens, we identified the sole C. elegans Distalless/Dlx ortholog, ceh-43, as a factor that acts through one of the homeodomain sites to control both induction and maintenance of terminal dopaminergic fate. The second type of homeodomain site is a Pbx-type site, which is recognized in a partially redundant and neuron subtype-specific manner by two Pbx factors, ceh-20 and ceh-40, revealing novel roles of Pbx factors in the context of terminal neuron differentiation. Taken together, we revealed a specific regulatory signature and cognate, terminal selector-type transcription factors that define the entire dopaminergic nervous system of an animal.

A number of mathematical models have been hypothesized to describe these social contagion phenomena, but these models remain largely untested against empirical data. We used Bayesian model selection to test between various hypotheses about the spread of a simple social behaviour, applause after an academic presentation. Individuals' probability of starting clapping increased in proportion to the number of other audience members already 'infected' by this social contagion, regardless of their spatial proximity. The cessation of applause is similarly socially mediated, but is to a lesser degree controlled by the reluctance of individuals to clap too many times. We also found consistent differences between individuals in their willingness to start and stop clapping. The social contagion model arising from our analysis predicts that the time the audience spends clapping can vary considerably, even in the absence of any differences in the quality of the presentations they have heard.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian model selection", "SIR model", "applause", "clapping", "social contagion"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University, Uppsala 75106, Sweden. rmann@math.uu.se"}, {"First Name": "Jolyon", "Last Name": "Faria", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J T", "Last Name": "Sumpter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Krause", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "PubDate": "2013Aug06"}, {"PMID": "23555206", "Title": "Multi-scale inference of interaction rules in animal groups using Bayesian model selection.", "Abstract": "Inference of interaction rules of animals moving in groups usually relies on an analysis of large scale system behaviour. Models are tuned through repeated simulation until they match the observed behaviour. More recent work has used the fine scale motions of animals to validate and fit the rules of interaction of animals in groups. Here, we use a Bayesian methodology to compare a variety of models to the collective motion of glass prawns (Paratya australiensis). We show that these exhibit a stereotypical 'phase transition', whereby an increase in density leads to the onset of collective motion in one direction. We fit models to this data, which range from: a mean-field model where all prawns interact globally; to a spatial Markovian model where prawns are self-propelled particles influenced only by the current positions and directions of their neighbours; up to non-Markovian models where prawns have 'memory' of previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. We show that the mean-field model fits the large scale behaviour of the system, but does not capture the observed locality of interactions. Traditional self-propelled particle models fail to capture the fine scale dynamics of the system. The most sophisticated model, the non-Markovian model, provides a good match to the data at both the fine scale and in terms of reproducing global dynamics, while maintaining a biologically plausible perceptual range. We conclude that prawns' movements are influenced by not just the current direction of nearby conspecifics, but also those encountered in the recent past.
