[{"PMID": "38848678", "Title": "Isthmus progenitor cells contribute to homeostatic cellular turnover and support regeneration following intestinal injury.", "Abstract": "The currently accepted intestinal epithelial cell organization model proposes that Lgr5+ crypt-base columnar (CBC) cells represent the sole intestinal stem cell (ISC) compartment. However, previous studies have indicated that Lgr5+ cells are dispensable for intestinal regeneration, leading to two major hypotheses: one favoring the presence of a quiescent reserve ISC and the other calling for differentiated cell plasticity. To investigate these possibilities, we studied crypt epithelial cells in an unbiased fashion via high-resolution single-cell profiling. These studies, combined with in\u00a0vivo lineage tracing, show that Lgr5 is not a specific ISC marker and that stemness potential exists beyond the crypt base and resides in the isthmus region, where undifferentiated cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and regeneration following irradiation (IR) injury. Our results provide an alternative model of intestinal epithelial cell organization, suggesting that stemness potential is not restricted to CBC cells, and neither de-differentiation nor reserve ISC are drivers of intestinal regeneration.", "Keywords": ["adult stem cells", "cell potency", "epithelial stem cells", "intestinal stem cells", "intestine", "plasticity", "regeneration", "regulatory network analysis", "single cell", "stemness signature"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Regeneration", "Stem Cells", "Homeostasis", "Mice", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Intestines", "Cell Differentiation", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Epithelial Cells", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ermanno", "Last Name": "Malagola", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Vasciaveo", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yosuke", "Last Name": "Ochiai", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Woosook", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Biyun", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA;

Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments.

This critical knowledge gap is partially due to inadequate modeling of host-microbiome interactions in the etiology of esophageal cancers. Recent advances have enabled progress in this field. Three dimensional (3D) organoids faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia of the esophagus ex vivo and serve as a platform translatable for applications in precision medicine. Elsewhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the co-culture of 3D organoids with the bacterial microbiome has fostered insight into the pathogenic role of the microbiome in other GI cancers. Herein, we will summarize our current understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and esophageal cancer, discuss 3D organoid models of esophageal homeostasis, review analogous models of host-microbiome interactions in other GI cancers, and advocate for the application of these models to esophageal cancers.

Here, we study fingertip regeneration by amputating murine digit tips, either distally to initiate regeneration, or proximally, causing fibrosis. Using an unbiased microarray analysis, we found that digit tip regeneration is significantly associated with hair follicle differentiation, Wnt, and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathways. Viral over-expression and genetic knockouts showed the functional significance of these pathways during regeneration. Using transgenic reporter mice, we demonstrated that, while both canonical Wnt and HH signaling were limited to epidermal tissues, downstream hedgehog signaling (through Gli) occurred in mesenchymal tissues.

In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcholine", "Animals", "Doublecortin-Like Kinases", "Enteroendocrine Cells", "Female", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Moritz", "Last Name": "Middelhoff", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henrik", "Last Name": "Nienh\u00fcser", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Carlo", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Klinikum rechts der Isar, II.

Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin ligands (RSPO1-RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4-LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling, and induce intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However, gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise control of tissue regeneration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Self Renewal", "Female", "Humans",

"Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and \u03b2-catenin signalling.", "Abstract": "Wnt proteins modulate cell proliferation and differentiation and the self-renewal of stem cells by inducing \u03b2-catenin-dependent signalling through the Wnt receptor frizzled (FZD) and the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 to regulate cell fate decisions and the growth and repair of several tissues. The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD-LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic \u03b2-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Frizzled Receptors", "HEK293 Cells", "Hepatocytes", "Hepatomegaly", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Intestines", "Ligands", "Liver", "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5", "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Organoids", "Protein Multimerization", "Signal Transduction", "Solubility", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Wnt Proteins", "Wnt Signaling Pathway", "beta Catenin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claudia Y", "Last Name": "Janda", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luke T", "Last Name": "Dang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Changjiang", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Division of Biophysics, Department of Biology, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, 49076 Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Junlei", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wim", "Last Name": "de Lau", "Affiliation": "Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and University Medical Center Utrecht, Uppsalalaan 8, 3584 CT Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Zhendong A", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Program for Skeletal Disease and Tumor Microenvironment and Center for Cancer and Cell Biology, Van Andel Research Institute, 333 Bostwick NE, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelley S", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen", "Last Name": "Marecic", "Affiliation": "Hagey Laboratory for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine and Department of Surgery, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dirk", "Last Name": "Siepe", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xingnan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Moody", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bart O", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Program for Skeletal Disease and Tumor Microenvironment and Center for Cancer and Cell Biology, Van Andel Research Institute, 333 Bostwick NE, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hans", "Last Name": "Clevers", "Affiliation": "Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and University Medical Center Utrecht, Uppsalalaan 8, 3584 CT Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Piehler", "Affiliation": "Division of Biophysics, Department of Biology, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, 49076 Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Calvin J", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "K Christopher", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2017May11"}, {"PMID": "27581568", "Title": "Wnt pathway regulation of intestinal stem cells.", "Abstract": "Wnt signalling is involved in multiple aspects of embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, notably via controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation.

Here we combine finite element simulation of oxygen transport and quantitative comparative analysis of cellular microenvironments to elucidate the critical variables that promote reproducible intestinal organoid contraction. Experimentally, oxygen distribution was manipulated by adjusting the ambient oxygen concentration along with the use of semi-permeable membranes to enhance transport. The culture microenvironment was further tailored through variation of collagen type-I matrix density, addition of exogenous R-spondin1, and specification of culture geometry. \"Air-liquid interface\" cultures resulted in significantly higher numbers of contractile cultures relative to traditional submerged cultures. These interface cultures were confirmed to have enhanced and more symmetric oxygen transport relative to traditional submerged cultures. While oxygen availability was found to impact in vitro contraction rate and the orientation of contractile movement, it was not a key factor in enabling contractility. For all conditions tested, reproducible contractile behavior only occurred within a consistent and narrow range of collagen type-I matrix densities with porosities of approximately 20% and storage moduli near 30 Pa. This suggests that matrix density acts as a \"permissive switch\" that enables contractions to occur. Similarly, contractions were only observed in cultures with diameters less than 15.5 mm that had relatively large interfacial surface area between the compliant matrix and the rigid culture dish. Taken together, these data suggest that spatial geometry and mechanics of the microenvironment, which includes both the encapsulating matrix as well as the surrounding culture device, may be key determinants of intestinal organoid functionality.

Inconsistent or lack of reporting of the critical parameters associated with FACS methodologies has complicated interpretation, comparison, and reproduction of important findings. To address this problem a comprehensive multicenter study was designed to develop guidelines that limit experimental and data reporting variability and provide a foundation for accurate comparison of data between studies. Common methodologies and data reporting protocols for tissue dissociation, cell yield, cell viability, FACS, and postsort purity were established. Seven centers tested the standardized methods by FACS-isolating a specific crypt-based epithelial population (EpCAM+/CD44+) from murine small intestine. Genetic biomarkers for stem/progenitor (Lgr5 and Atoh 1) and differentiated cell lineages (lysozyme, mucin2, chromogranin A, and sucrase isomaltase) were interrogated in target and control populations to assess intra- and intercenter variability. Wilcoxon's rank sum test on gene expression levels showed limited intracenter variability between biological replicates. Principal component analysis demonstrated significant intercenter reproducibility among four centers. Analysis of data collected by standardized cell isolation methods and data reporting requirements readily identified methodological problems, indicating that standard reporting parameters facilitate post hoc error identification. These results indicate that the complexity of FACS isolation of target intestinal epithelial populations can be highly reproducible between biological replicates and different institutions by adherence to common cell isolation methods and FACS gating strategies.

The Wnt signalling pathway is the major driving force for homeostatic self-renewal and regeneration in the mammalian intestine. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance Wnt-driven proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in mice and humans that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP; also known as YAP1)--a protein known for its powerful growth-inducing and oncogenic properties--has an unexpected growth-suppressive function, restricting Wnt signals during intestinal regeneration. Transgenic expression of YAP reduces Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid loss of intestinal crypts. In addition, loss of YAP results in Wnt hypersensitivity during regeneration, leading to hyperplasia, expansion of intestinal stem cells and niche cells, and formation of ectopic crypts and microadenomas. We find that cytoplasmic YAP restricts elevated Wnt signalling independently of the AXIN-APC-GSK-3\u03b2 complex partly by limiting the activity of dishevelled (DVL). DVL signals in the nucleus of intestinal stem cells, and its forced expression leads to enhanced Wnt signalling in crypts. YAP dampens Wnt signals by restricting DVL nuclear translocation during regenerative growth. Finally, we provide evidence that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas, and that its expression can restrict the growth of colorectal carcinoma xenografts. Collectively, our work describes a novel mechanistic paradigm for how proliferative signals are counterbalanced in regenerating tissues.
