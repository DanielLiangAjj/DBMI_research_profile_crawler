[{"PMID": "38568393", "Title": "Health Disparities Among Children in Immigrant Households: New York City 2009 and 2017.", "Abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that children in New York City (NYC) with an immigrant parent were more likely to lack health insurance and report poorer parent-rated health compared to those of US-born parents in this serial, cross-sectional study using existing data from 2009 to 2017 among children age\u2009<\u200912 years in two NYC health surveys. Main outcomes were parent-reported responses for (1) child insurance coverage and (2) child general health status. In multivariable logistic regression models, we estimated likelihood of outcomes for children of immigrants compared to those of US-born parents, adjusting for child, parent, and household characteristics. We included 2,637 children in 2009 and 7,042 in 2017 in NYC. In 2017, children of immigrant parents were more likely to experience uninsurance than children of US-born parents [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.36 (95% CI: 1.05-5.31)]. Compared to children of US-born parents, children with an immigrant parent were more likely to have a gap in insurance coverage in both 2009 (AOR 1.88; 95% CI: 1.08-3.27) and 2017 (AOR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.06-2.41). Although more children of immigrants had poor/fair health than those of US-born parents in both years, differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for covariates. Our findings among a sample of children eligible for health insurance suggest policies intended to expand child health care access did not equitably reach children of immigrants despite their eligibility for health insurance. Tailored interventions for children of immigrants are needed to mitigate disparities in health insurance coverage.", "Keywords": ["Child health", "Health care disparities", "Health services research", "Immigrant"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Woo Baidal", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jw3286@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mary-Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Vachon", "Affiliation": "Division of Family and Child Health, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diksha", "Last Name": "Brahmbhatt", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janet E", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, City University of New York (CUNY), New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of immigrant and minority health", "PubDate": "2024Apr03"}, {"PMID": "38337718", "Title": "Longitudinal Associations of Food Security with Health and Dietary Factors among Food FARMacy Participants during COVID-19 in New York City.", "Abstract": "In cross-sectional studies, food insecurity is associated with adverse health and dietary outcomes.

The aim of this study was to examine the sustained impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures on the diet and exercise habits, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life among adults in the U.S. We conducted a longitudinal study using a convenience sample of participants recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform between March 30 and April 7, 2020, and 8 months into the outbreak, from November 2 to November 21, 2020. We compared self-reported diet and exercise habits and risk for food insecurity shortly after the pandemic began, in April, to those reported in November. We also measured changes in quality-of-life using the PROMIS-29\u00a0+\u00a02 (PROPr) scale. A total of 636 respondents completed both surveys. Compared to reports in April, respondents ate lunch and dinner out more frequently in November and consumed more take-out and fast food. Weekly frequencies of consuming frozen food and the number of daily meals were slightly lower in November than they were in April. 54% of respondents screened positively for being at risk for food insecurity in April, reducing to 41% by November. In April, survey respondents were found to have lower quality-of-life relative to U.S. population norms, but by November levels of depression and cognitive function had improved. Our findings underscore how the initial effects of the pandemic on diet, exercise, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life have evolved. As U.S. states re-open, continued efforts to encourage healthy eating and support mental health, especially to reduce feelings of anxiety and social isolation, remain important to mitigate the potential long-term effects of the pandemic.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "Diet", "Exercise", "Food insecurity", "Quality of life"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "COVID-19", "Diet", "Food Insecurity", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Pandemics", "Quality of Life", "SARS-CoV-2", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandra M", "Last Name": "Rogers", "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Healthcare Innovations Research and Evaluation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brianna N", "Last Name": "Lauren", "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Healthcare Innovations Research and Evaluation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer A", "Last Name": "Woo Baidal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elissa M", "Last Name": "Ozanne", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Healthcare Innovations Research and Evaluation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Obesity and its comorbidities appear to be linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality.

In New York City, a telehealth pediatric weight-management collaborative spanning NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Weill Cornell Medicine was developed during COVID-19 with show rates from 76% to 89%. To stave off the impending exacerbation of health disparities related to obesity risk factors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective interventions that can be delivered remotely are urgently needed among vulnerable children with obesity.

The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that higher alpha-tocopherol intake during early childhood is associated with lower odds of elevated ALT levels during mid-childhood and to examine how body mass index (BMI) influences these relationships. We studied 528 children in Project Viva. Mothers reported child dietary intake at early childhood visits (median 3.1 years) using a validated food frequency questionnaire. At mid-childhood (median 7.6 years), we collected child blood and anthropometric data. The main outcome was elevated sex-specific mid-childhood ALT level (\u226522.1 U/L for female children and \u226525.8 U/L for male children). In multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed the association of energy-adjusted alpha-tocopherol intake with ALT levels, adjusting for child age, sex, race/ethnicity, diet, and age-adjusted sex-specific BMI z-score at mid-childhood. Among children in this study, 48% were female, 63% were non-Hispanic white, 19% were non-Hispanic black, and 4% were Hispanic/Latino. Mean alpha-tocopherol intake was 3.7 \u00b1 1.0 mg/day (range, 1.4-9.2) at early childhood. At mid-childhood, mean BMI z-score was 0.41 \u00b1 1.0 units and 22% had an elevated ALT level. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, children with higher early childhood vitamin E intake had lower odds of elevated mid-childhood ALT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39, 0.99) for quartiles 2-4 compared with the lowest quartile of intake.
