[{"PMID": "37961740", "Title": "Brain-like Flexible Visual Inference by Harnessing Feedback-Feedforward Alignment.", "Abstract": "In natural vision, feedback connections support versatile visual inference capabilities such as making sense of the occluded or noisy bottom-up sensory information or mediating pure top-down processes such as imagination. However, the mechanisms by which the feedback pathway learns to give rise to these capabilities flexibly are not clear. We propose that top-down effects emerge through alignment between feedforward and feedback pathways, each optimizing its own objectives. To achieve this co-optimization, we introduce Feedback-Feedforward Alignment (FFA), a learning algorithm that leverages feedback and feedforward pathways as mutual credit assignment computational graphs, enabling alignment. In our study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FFA in co-optimizing classification and reconstruction tasks on widely used MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Notably, the alignment mechanism in FFA endows feedback connections with emergent visual inference functions, including denoising, resolving occlusions, hallucination, and imagination. Moreover, FFA offers bio-plausibility compared to traditional back-propagation (BP) methods in implementation. By repurposing the computational graph of credit assignment into a goal-driven feedback pathway, FFA alleviates weight transport problems encountered in BP, enhancing the bio-plausibility of the learning algorithm. Our study presents FFA as a promising proof-of-concept for the mechanisms underlying how feedback connections in the visual cortex support flexible visual functions. This work also contributes to the broader field of visual inference underlying perceptual phenomena and has implications for developing more biologically inspired learning algorithms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tahereh", "Last Name": "Toosi", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Elias B", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "ArXiv", "PubDate": "2023Oct31"}, {"PMID": "36594035", "Title": "Marmoset core visual object recognition behavior is comparable to that of macaques and humans.", "Abstract": "Among the smallest simian primates, the common marmoset offers promise as an experimentally tractable primate model for neuroscience with translational potential to humans. However, given its exceedingly small brain and body, the gap in perceptual and cognitive abilities between marmosets and humans requires study. Here, we performed a comparison of marmoset behavior to that of three other species in the domain of high-level vision. We first found that marmosets outperformed rats\u00a0- a marmoset-sized rodent\u00a0- on a simple recognition task, with marmosets robustly recognizing objects across views. On a more challenging invariant object recognition task used previously in humans, marmosets also achieved high performance. Notably, across hundreds of images, marmosets' image-by-image behavior was highly similar to that of humans\u00a0- nearly as human-like as macaque behavior.

A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior by predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral signatures against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected more than one million behavioral trials from 1472 anonymous humans and five male macaque monkeys for 2400 images over 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feedforward convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNNIC models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion. However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all tested DCNNIC models were significantly nonpredictive of primate performance and that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes nor rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNNIC models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates and that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision. To this end, large-scale, high-resolution primate behavioral benchmarks such as those obtained here could serve as direct guides for discovering such models.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, specific feedforward deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) models have dramatically advanced our quantitative understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying primate core object recognition. In this work, we tested the limits of those ANNs by systematically comparing the behavioral responses of these models with the behavioral responses of humans and monkeys at the resolution of individual images. Using these high-resolution metrics, we found that all tested ANN models significantly diverged from primate behavior.

The fMRI demonstration of face-preferring regions in human ventral cortex and monkey inferior temporal cortex (\"face patches\") raises the question of how neural selectivity for faces is organized. Here, we targeted hundreds of spatially registered neural recordings to the largest fMRI-identified face-preferring region in monkeys, the middle face patch (MFP), and show that the MFP contains a graded enrichment of face-preferring neurons. At its center, as much as 93% of the sites we sampled responded twice as strongly to faces than to nonface objects. We estimate the maximum neurophysiological size of the MFP to be \u223c6 mm in diameter, consistent with its previously reported size under fMRI. Importantly, face selectivity in the MFP varied strongly even between neighboring sites. Additionally, extremely face-selective sites were \u223c40 times more likely to be present inside the MFP than outside. These results provide the first direct quantification of the size and neural composition of the MFP by showing that the cortical tissue localized to the fMRI defined region consists of a very high fraction of face-preferring sites near its center, and a monotonic decrease in that fraction along any radial spatial axis.", "Keywords": ["faces", "inferior temporal cortex", "monkey", "neurophysiology", "spatial organization"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Face", "Female", "Macaca mulatta", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Recognition, Psychology", "Temporal Lobe", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul L", "Last Name": "Aparicio", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139."}, {"First Name": "Elias B", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "DiCarlo", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 dicarlo@mit.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2016Dec14"}, {"PMID": "24048850", "Title": "Large-scale, high-resolution neurophysiological maps underlying FMRI of macaque temporal lobe.", "Abstract": "Maps obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are thought to reflect the underlying spatial layout of neural activity. However, previous studies have not been able to directly compare fMRI maps to high-resolution neurophysiological maps, particularly in higher level visual areas. Here, we used a novel stereo microfocal x-ray system to localize thousands of neural recordings across monkey inferior temporal cortex (IT), construct large-scale maps of neuronal object selectivity at subvoxel resolution, and compare those neurophysiology maps with fMRI maps from the same subjects. While neurophysiology maps contained reliable structure at the sub-millimeter scale, fMRI maps of object selectivity contained information at larger scales (>2.5 mm) and were only partly correlated with raw neurophysiology maps collected in the same subjects. However, spatial smoothing of neurophysiology maps more than doubled that correlation, while a variety of alternative transforms led to no significant improvement. Furthermore, raw spiking signals, once spatially smoothed, were as predictive of fMRI maps as local field potential signals. Thus, fMRI of the inferior temporal lobe reflects a spatially low-passed version of neurophysiology signals. These findings strongly validate the widespread use of fMRI for detecting large (>2.5 mm) neuronal domains of object selectivity but show that a complete understanding of even the most pure domains (e.g., faces vs nonface objects) requires investigation at fine scales that can currently only be obtained with invasive neurophysiological methods.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Macaca mulatta", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurons", "Oxygen", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elias B", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."}, {"First Name": "Alex M", "Last Name": "Papanastassiou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "DiCarlo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Sep18"}, {"PMID": "23486204", "Title": "Increased neural correlations in primate auditory cortex during slow-wave sleep.", "Abstract": "During sleep, changes in brain rhythms and neuromodulator levels in cortex modify the properties of individual neurons and the network as a whole. In principle, network-level interactions during sleep can be studied by observing covariation in spontaneous activity between neurons. Spontaneous activity, however, reflects only a portion of the effective functional connectivity that is activated by external and internal inputs (e.g., sensory stimulation, motor behavior, and mental activity), and it has been shown that neural responses are less correlated during external sensory stimulation than during spontaneous activity. Here, we took advantage of the unique property that the auditory cortex continues to respond to sounds during sleep and used external acoustic stimuli to activate cortical networks for studying neural interactions during sleep. We found that during slow-wave sleep (SWS), local (neuron-neuron) correlations are not reduced by acoustic stimulation remaining higher than in wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep and remaining similar to spontaneous activity correlations. This high level of correlations during SWS complements previous work finding elevated global (local field potential-local field potential) correlations during sleep. Contrary to the prediction that slow oscillations in SWS would increase neural correlations during spontaneous activity, we found little change in neural correlations outside of periods of acoustic stimulation. Rather, these findings suggest that functional connections recruited in sound processing are modified during SWS and that slow rhythms, which in general are suppressed by sensory stimulation, are not the sole mechanism leading to elevated network correlations during sleep.", "Keywords": ["auditory cortex", "electrophysiology", "hearing", "primate", "sensory", "sleep"], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Auditory Cortex", "Brain Waves", "Callithrix", "Female", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Sleep, REM", "Wakefulness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elias B", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Auditory Neurophysiology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}]
