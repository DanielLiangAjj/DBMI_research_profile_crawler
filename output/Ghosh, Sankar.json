Although activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has long been implicated in Tconv biology, the cell-autonomous roles of the separate NF-\u03baB transcription-factor subunits are unknown. Here, we dissected the contributions of the canonical NF-\u03baB subunits RelA and c-Rel to Tconv function. RelA, rather than c-Rel, regulated Tconv activation and cytokine production at steady-state and was required for polarization toward the TH17 lineage in vitro. Accordingly, RelA-deficient mice were fully protected against neuroinflammation in a model of multiple sclerosis due to defective transition to a pathogenic TH17 gene-expression program. Conversely, Tconv-restricted ablation of c-Rel impaired their function in the microenvironment of transplanted tumors, resulting in enhanced cancer burden. Moreover, Tconv required c-Rel for the response to PD-1-blockade therapy.

chemotaxis and cytokine responses in macrophages.", "Abstract": "Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor member 1b (RasGEF1b) of the RasGEF/CDC25 domain-containing family is preferentially expressed by macrophages. However, information is lacking about its role in macrophage function. In this study, we generated mice with ubiquitous deletion of Rasgef1b and used RNA-seq-based transcriptomics to compare the global gene expression in wild-type and knock-out primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages under basal conditions and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Transcriptional filtering identified several genes with significantly different transcript levels between wild-type and knock-out macrophages. In total, 49 and 37 differentially expressed genes were identified at baseline and in LPS-activated macrophages, respectively. Distinct biological processes were significantly linked to down-regulated genes at the basal condition only, and largely included chemotaxis, response to cytokines, and positive regulation of GTPase activity. Importantly, validation by RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of genes identified as down-regulated after LPS stimulation was also decreased in the knock-out cells under basal conditions. We used a luciferase-based reporter assay to showcase the capability of RasGEF1b in activating the Serpinb2 promoter. Notably, knockdown of RasGEF1b in RAW264.7 macrophages resulted in impaired transcriptional activation of the Serpinb2 promoter, both in constitutive and LPS-stimulated conditions. This study provides a small collection of genes that shows relative expression changes effected by the absence of RasGEF1b in macrophages. Thus, we present the first evidence that RasGEF1b mediates the regulation of both steady-state and signal-dependent expression of genes and propose that this GEF plays a role in the maintenance of the basal transcriptional level in macrophages.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Chemotaxis", "Cytokines", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heliana B", "Last Name": "Fernandes", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Inflammatory Genes, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Isadora Mafra", "Last Name": "de Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Inflammatory Genes, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Thomas S", "Last Name": "Postler", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "S\u00e9rgio Q", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Inflammatory Genes, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "C\u00edcera A C", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Inflammatory Genes, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Michaelle S", "Last Name": "Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Inflammatory Genes, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Felipe B", "Last Name": "Le\u00e3o", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria C", "Last Name": "Souza", "Affiliation": "Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Av.

Amongst other advantages, LRS preserves more information about RNA at the transcript level than conventional high-throughput sequencing, including far more accurate and quantitative records of splicing patterns. New studies with LRS datasets are being published at an exponential rate, generating a vast reservoir of information that can be leveraged to address a host of different research questions. However, mining such publicly available data in a tailored fashion is currently not easy, as the available software tools typically require familiarity with the command-line interface, which constitutes a significant obstacle to many researchers. Additionally, different research groups utilize different software packages to perform LRS analysis, which often prevents a direct comparison of published results across different studies. To address these challenges, we have developed the Long-Read Analysis Pipeline for Transcriptomics (L-RAPiT), a user-friendly, free pipeline requiring no dedicated computational resources or bioinformatics expertise. L-RAPiT can be implemented directly through Google Colaboratory, a system based on the open-source Jupyter notebook environment, and allows for the direct analysis of transcriptomic reads from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio LRS machines.

Here, we demonstrate a requirement for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the osteogenic commitment and differentiation of skeletal progenitors. Deletion of Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate in Toll pathways (ECSIT) in skeletal progenitors hinders bone formation and regeneration, resulting in skeletal deformity, defects in the bone marrow niche and spontaneous fractures followed by persistent nonunion. Upon skeletal fracture, Ecsit-deficient skeletal progenitors migrate to adjacent skeletal muscle causing muscle atrophy. These phenotypes are intrinsic to ECSIT function in skeletal progenitors, as little skeletal abnormalities were observed in mice lacking Ecsit in committed osteoprogenitors or mature osteoblasts.

WES in Ion ProtonTM platform on 'discovery set' (n\u2009=\u200915), followed by recurrence assessment of the observed variants on 'confirmation set' (n\u2009=\u200940) using Sanger Sequencing was performed on the HNC-prevalent NE Indian populations.

Subsequent pathway and gene ontology analysis revealed that EXO1, RAD52 and TP53 variants affected the Double-Strand Break Repair pathway, whereas CHD5 and HACE1 variants inactivated DNA repair cascade, facilitating uncontrolled cell proliferation, impaired apoptosis and malignant transformation.

In addition to retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (ROR-\u03b3t), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is essential for the differentiation and inflammatory function of TH17 cells. To investigate the roles of HIF-1\u03b1 in the functional regulation of TH17 cells under the normal physiological condition without genetic modification, the nucleus-transducible form of transcription modulation domain (TMD) of HIF-1\u03b1 (ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD) was generated by conjugating HIF-1\u03b1-TMD to Hph-1 protein transduction domain (PTD). ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD was effectively delivered into the nucleus of T cells without cellular cytotoxicity. ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD significantly blocked the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into TH17 cells in a dose-dependent manner via IL-17A and ROR-\u03b3t expression inhibition. However, T-cell activation events such as induction of CD69, CD25, and IL-2 and the differentiation potential of na\u00efve T cells into TH1, TH2, or Treg cells were not affected by ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD. Interestingly, TH17 cells differentiated from na\u00efve T cells in the presence of ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD showed a substantial level of suppressive activity toward the activated T cells, and the increase of Foxp3 and IL-10 expression was detected in these TH17 cells. When mRNA expression pattern was compared between TH17 cells and ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD-treated TH17 cells, the expression of the genes involved in the differentiation and functions of TH17 cells was downregulated, and that of the genes necessary for immune-suppressive functions of Treg cells was upregulated. When the mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were treated with ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD with anti-IL-17A mAb as a positive control, the therapeutic efficacy of ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD in vivo was comparable with that of anti-IL-17A mAb, and ntHIF-1\u03b1-TMD-mediated therapeutic effect was contributed by the functional conversion of TH17 cells into immune-suppressive T cells.

In addition to its antigluconeogenic and insulin-sensitizing properties, metformin has emerged as a potent inhibitor of the chronic inflammatory response of macrophages. In particular, metformin treatment has been shown to reduce expression of interleukin (IL-) 1\u03b2 during long-term exposure to the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreases the levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1-\u03b1, and through enhanced expression of IL-10. However, the effect of metformin on the acute inflammatory response, before significant levels of ROS accumulate in the cell, has not been explored. Here, we show that metformin alters the acute inflammatory response through its activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but independently of HIF1-\u03b1 and IL-10, in primary macrophages and two macrophage-like cell lines. Thus, metformin changes the acute and the chronic inflammatory response through fundamentally distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis reveals that metformin pretreatment affects the levels of a large yet selective subset of inflammatory genes, dampening the response to short-term LPS exposure and affecting a wide range of pathways and biological functions.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a pleiotropic kinase that acts as a key effector downstream of PI3K in many cell types. In T cells, PDK1 has been shown to be critical for activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling upon TCR ligation and is therefore essential for effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Using Treg cell-specific conditional deletion, we now demonstrate that PDK1 is also essential for Treg cell suppressive activity in vivo. Ablation of Pdk1 specifically in Treg cells led to systemic, lethal, scurfy-like inflammation in mice. Genome-wide analysis confirmed that PDK1 is essential for the regulation of key Treg cell signature gene expression and, further, suggested that PDK1 acts primarily to control Treg cell gene expression through regulation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Consistent with these results, the scurfy-like phenotype of mice lacking PDK1 in Treg cells was rescued by enforced activation of NF-\u03baB downstream of PDK1.

Furthermore, we observed that PIC, a viral mimetic, induces Lnc13 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm promoting the interaction of STAT1 mRNA with (poly[rC] binding protein 2) (PCBP2). Interestingly, Lnc13-PCBP2 interaction regulates the stability of the STAT1 mRNA, sustaining inflammation in \u03b2-cells in an allele-specific manner. Our results show that the T1D-associated Lnc13 may contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D by increasing pancreatic \u03b2-cell inflammation.

Importantly, preclinical models have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor antagonism prevents the lung injury and subsequent abnormal development that typically results following perinatal exposure to inflammatory stresses. This receptor is activated by two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. While many studies have linked IL-1\u03b2 to BPD development, IL-1\u03b1 is relatively under-studied. The objective of our study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory stress induces IL-1\u03b1 expression in the neonatal lung, and if so, whether this expression is mediated by innate immune NF\u03baB signaling. We found that endotoxemia induced IL-1\u03b1 expression during the saccular stage of neonatal lung development and was not present in the other neonatal organs or the adult lung. This IL-1\u03b1 expression was dependent upon sustained pulmonary NF\u03baB activation, which was specific to the neonatal lung. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we found that pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of NF\u03baB signaling attenuated IL-1\u03b1 expression. These findings demonstrate that innate immune regulation of IL-1\u03b1 expression is developmentally regulated and occurs via an NF\u03baB dependent mechanism. Importantly, the specific role of developmentally regulated pulmonary IL-1\u03b1 expression remains unknown.

Thus, the present study aimed to characterize indigenous chicken from bio-diversity hotspot of Sunderban and Northeast India using DNA sequence based barcoding approach. A total of 15 CO1 (Cytochrome c Oxidase-I) DNA barcode of different indigenous chicken were newly sequenced along with 6 previously published sequences from our laboratory and compared with the available data of distinctive genera of Phasianidae as per the standard protocol and are identified as Gallus gallus. About 98.96% of the Phasianid birds were successfully delimitated into the respective species except for 12 congeneric pairs whose minimum interspecific K2P (Kimura 2-parameter) distance overlaps with the maximum intraspecific distance (3.9%). The least genetic divergence is observed between G. gallus and G. varius (0.013%) and highest between G. gallus and G. lafayettei (0.059%). The NJ tree showed a cohesive clustering of indigenous chicken with G. gallus and distinct with respect to all the different species under study, thereby revealing their taxonomic position except for few G. sonneratti that showed mixed clustering with G. gallus.

Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of immune mediated disorders is not totally understood, high-throughput genomic studies, such as GWAS and Immunochip, performed in the past few years have provided intriguing hints about underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to disease. More than a hundred gene variants associated with disease susceptibility have been identified through such studies, but the progress toward understanding the underlying mechanisms has been slow. The majority of the identified risk variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome making it difficult to assign a molecular function to the SNPs. However, recent studies have revealed that many of the non-coding regions bearing disease-associated SNPs generate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

In this work, we show that either way alterations in the levels of Rap2a hampers proper macrophages response to TLR stimulation. Rap2a is activated by LPS in macrophages, and although putative activator TLR-inducible Ras guanine exchange factor RasGEF1b was sufficient to induce, it was not fully required for Rap2a activation. Silencing of Rap2a impaired LPS-induced production of IL-6 cytokine and KC/Cxcl1 chemokine, and also NF-\u03baB activity as measured by reporter gene studies. Surprisingly, overexpression of Rap2a did also lead to marked inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation induced by LPS, Pam3CSK4 and downstream TLR signaling molecules. We also found that Rap2a can inhibit the LPS-induced phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 at serine 536.

Targeted re-sequencing (n\u2009=\u200960) of 170 genetic regions from 75 genes was carried out in Ion-PGM\u2122 and validation (n\u2009=\u2009116) of the observed variants was done using Sequenom iPLEX MassARRAY\u2122 platform followed by polymerase chain reaction-based HPV genotyping and p16-immunohistochemistry study. Subsequently, estimation of population structure, different statistical and in silico approaches were undertaken. We identified one nonsense-mediated mRNA decay transcript variant in the DFNA5 region (rs2237306), associated with Benzo(a)pyrene, as a protective factor (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.33; p\u2009=\u20090.009) and four harmful (odds ratio\u2009>\u20092.5; p\u2009<\u20090.05) intronic variants, rs182361, rs290974, and rs169724 in SYK and rs1670661 in NELL1 region, involved in genetic susceptibility to tobacco- and HPV-mediated oral oncogenesis. Among the oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, 12.6% (11/87) were HPV positive, out of which 45.5% (5/11) were HPV16-infected, 27.3% (3/11) were HPV18-infected, and 27.3% (3/11) had an infection of both subtypes. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed that the interactions among HPV and NELL1 variant rs1670661 with age and gender augmented the risk of both non-tobacco- and tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. These suggest that HPV infection may be one of the important risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma in this population. Finally, we newly report a DFNA5 variant probably conferring protection via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway against tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the analytical approach used here can be useful in predicting the population-specific significant variants associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma in any heterogeneous population.", "Keywords": ["HPV-mediated oncogenesis", "Smokeless tobacco", "germline variant", "heterogeneous populations", "nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway", "prolonged tobacco-chewers", "protective single nucleotide polymorphism", "tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Female", "Humans", "India", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Prevalence", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Syk Kinase", "Tobacco Use"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharbadeb", "Last Name": "Kundu", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, India."}, {"First Name": "Vijayalakshmi", "Last Name": "Ramshankar", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Preventive Oncology (Research), Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Akalesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Zoology, Cotton University, Guwahati, India."}, {"First Name": "Soundara Viveka", "Last Name": "Thangaraj", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Preventive Oncology (Research), Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Arvind", "Last Name": "Krishnamurthy", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Surgical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Rajeev", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Molecular Oncology, Cachar Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, Silchar, India."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Kannan", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Molecular Oncology, Cachar Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, Silchar, India."}, {"First Name": "Sankar Kumar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, India."}], "Journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "PubDate": "2018Aug"}, {"PMID": "29978433", "Title": "Immuno-suppressive function of nucleus-transducible BAF57-\u0394PH in T cell activation via degradation of endogenous BAF57.", "Abstract": "The BAF57 subunit, an indispensable member of the BAF complex, is functionally implicated in apoptosis, cell cycle, and T cell development through chromosomal remodeling.

In this study, a nucleus-transducible form of BAF57, absent the proline-rich and HMG domains (ntBAF57-\u0394PH), was generated to interfere with the interaction between BAF57 and its binding protein, BAF155. ntBAF57-\u0394PH was effectively delivered into mouse CD4+ T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, without cellular toxicity.

Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic immune response to disseminated infection that has a high mortality rate. In some patients, sepsis results in a period of immunosuppression (known as 'immunoparalysis')1 characterized by reduced inflammatory cytokine output2, increased secondary infection3 and an increased risk of organ failure and mortality4. Lipopolysaccharide tolerance recapitulates several key features of sepsis-associated immunosuppression5. Although various epigenetic changes have previously been observed in tolerized macrophages6-8, the molecular basis of tolerance, immunoparalysis and other forms of innate immune memory has remained unclear. Here we perform a screen for tolerance-associated microRNAs and identify miR-221 and miR-222 as regulators of the functional reprogramming of macrophages during lipopolysaccharide tolerization. Prolonged stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in mice leads to increased expression of miR-221 and mir-222, both of which regulate brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1, also known as Smarca4). This increased expression causes the transcriptional silencing of a subset of inflammatory genes that depend on chromatin remodelling mediated by SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which in turn promotes tolerance. In patients with sepsis, increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 correlates with immunoparalysis and increased organ damage.

Prolonged tobacco and alcohol consumption constitute the major etiological factors for HNC development, which induce DNA damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathway is a crucial system in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. The present work was aimed to predict the consequence of significant germline variants of the DNA repair genes in disease predisposition. Whole exome sequencing was performed in Ion Proton\u2122 platform on 15 case-control samples from the HNC-prevalent states of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Variant annotation was done in Ion Reporter\u2122 as well as wANNOVAR. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analysis identified significant exonic and intronic variants associated with HNC. Amongst our observed variants, 78.6% occurred in ExAC, 94% reported in dbSNP and 5.8% & 9.3% variants were present in ClinVar and HGMD, respectively. The total variants were dispersed among 199 genes with DSBR and FA pathway being the most mutated pathways. The allelic association test suggested that the intronic variants in HLTF and RAD52 gene significantly associated (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) with the risk (OR\u202f>\u202f5), while intronic variants in PARP4, RECQL5, EXO1 and PER1 genes and exonic variant in TDP2 gene showed protection (OR\u202f<\u202f1) for HNC. MDR analysis proposed the exonic variants in MSH6, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53 genes and intronic variant in RECQL5 genetic region working together during certain phase of DNA repair mechanism for HNC causation. In addition, other intronic and 3'UTR variations caused modifications in the transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites associated with HNC.

Whether targeting I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling affects the anti-apoptotic gene expression, a known consequence of global LPS-induced NF\u03baB inhibition, is unknown.MethodsMacrophages (RAW 264.7, bone marrow-derived macrophage) were assessed for LPS-induced IL1\u03b2 mRNA/protein expression, anti-apoptotic gene expression, cell viability (trypan blue exclusion), and activation of apoptosis (caspase-3 and PARP cleavage) following pharmacologic and genetic attenuation of I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling.

The distance-based approach has a limitation in defining a universal species boundary across the taxa as the rate of mtDNA evolution is not constant throughout the taxa. However, character-based approach more accurately defines this using a unique set of nucleotide characters. The character-based analysis of full-length barcode has some inherent limitations, like sequencing of the full-length barcode, use of a sparse-data matrix and lack of a uniform diagnostic position for each group. A short continuous stretch of a fragment can be used to resolve the limitations.

This fragment is used to design species-specific barcode motifs for 109 species by the character-based method, which successfully identifies the correct species using a pattern-matching program. The motifs also correctly identify geographically isolated population of the Cypriniformes species. Further, this region is validated as a species-specific mini-barcode for freshwater fishes by successful PCR amplification and sequencing of the motif (154\u00a0bp) using the designed primers.

We studied this process in the airways by immunizing mice intranasally with the antigen ovalbumin together with either of two Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. We found the TLR5 ligand flagellin promoted a type 2 helper T cell response, whereas, a TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) promoted a type 1 helper T cell response. CpG ODN induced mRNA encoding interleukin (IL)-12 p40, whereas, flagellin caused IL-33 secretion and induced mRNAs encoding IL-1 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). By using mice deficient in the TLR and IL-1R signaling molecule, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs), and by cell sorting different lung populations after 2 hours of in vivo stimulation, we characterized the cell types that rapidly produced inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR stimulation. CpG ODN was likely recognized by TLR9 on cDCs and AMs, which made mRNA encoding IL-12. IL-12 was necessary for the subsequent innate and adaptive interferon-\u03b3 production. In contrast, flagellin stimulated multiple cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin, including AMs, DCs, monocytes, and lung epithelial cells. AMs were largely responsible for IL-1\u03b1, whereas lung epithelial cells made TSLP. Multiple hematopoietic cells, including AMs, DCs, and monocytes contributed to other cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. MyD88-dependent signals, likely through IL-1R and IL-33R, and MyD88-independent signals, likely from TSLP, were necessary in cDCs for promotion of the early IL-4 response by CD4 T cells in the draining lymph node.

DNA repair genes play a vital role in preventing carcinogenesis by maintaining genomic integrity. Polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequence of DNA repair genes are often reported to be associated with an increased risk for different cancers. The OGG1 gene encodes the enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase which removes oxidatively damaged bases of DNA. Several studies report that the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism increases the risk for cancers of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract. However, other studies provide evidence that such an association does not exist. A meta-analysis to assess the role of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the cancers of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract was therefore undertaken in order to resolve this ambiguity. Seventeen studies were recruited for this meta-analysis after screening 58 articles with a total of 5533 cases and 6834 controls for which the odds ratio with 95\u00a0% confidence interval was calculated. Begg's funnel test and Egger's test were performed for calculating publication bias. Our study reveals an association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and cancer susceptibility of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract (CG\u00a0+\u00a0GG vs CC; odds ratio, OR 1.22; 95\u00a0% CI 1.05-1.41; GG vs CG\u00a0+\u00a0CC; OR 1.36; 95\u00a0% CI 1.09-1.70; GG vs CC; OR 1.46; 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-1.92). Subgroup analysis based on cancer types and ethnicity also revealed the association of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism to the risk for upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract cancers among both the Asian and the Caucasian populations. No risk was however observed for smoking habits and OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism.

Other advantages of DNA barcoding include authentication and safety assessment of seafood, wildlife forensics, conservation genetics and detection of invasive alien species (IAS). Global DNA barcoding efforts in the marine habitat include MarBOL, CeDAMar, CMarZ, SHARK-BOL, etc. An overview on DNA barcoding of different marine groups ranging from the microbes to mammals is revealed.

We found that NF-\u03baB was activated within the hippocampus and cortex of AD subjects and that activated forms of NF-\u03baB negatively correlated with cognitive function monitored by Mini-Mental State Examination and global cognitive z score. Accordingly, NF-\u03baB activation was also observed in the hippocampus of a transgenic (5XFAD) mouse model of AD. It has been shown that peptides corresponding to the NF-\u03baB essential modifier (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) of I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1) or I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) specifically inhibit the induction of NF-\u03baB activation without inhibiting the basal NF-\u03baB activity. Interestingly, after intranasal administration, wild-type NBD peptide entered into the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal activation of NF-\u03baB, suppressed hippocampal microglial activation, lowered the burden of A\u03b2 in the hippocampus, attenuated apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, protected plasticity-related molecules, and improved memory and learning in 5XFAD mice.

However, relatively little is understood about how this coupling is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of NF-\u03baB signaling in osteoclasts via a novel activity of charged multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5) is a key determinant of systemic rates of bone turnover. A conditional deletion of CHMP5 in osteoclasts leads to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts coupled with exuberant bone formation by osteoblasts, resembling an early onset, polyostotic form of human Paget's disease of bone (PDB). These phenotypes are reversed by haploinsufficiency for Rank, as well as by antiresorptive treatments, including alendronate, zolendronate, and OPG-Fc. Accordingly, CHMP5-deficient osteoclasts display increased RANKL-induced NF-\u03baB activation and osteoclast differentiation. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that CHMP5 cooperates with the PDB genetic risk factor valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) to stabilize the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1), down-regulating ubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 via the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15. Thus, CHMP5 tunes NF-\u03baB signaling downstream of RANK in osteoclasts to dampen osteoclast differentiation, osteoblast coupling and bone turnover rates, and disruption of CHMP5 activity results in a PDB-like skeletal disorder.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Animals", "Base Sequence", "Bone Development", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA

a major regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses, is a potent strategy for the treatment of endotoxic sepsis. To inhibit NF-\u03baB functions, we designed the intra-nuclear transducible form of transcription modulation domain (TMD) of RelA (p65), called nt-p65-TMD, which can be delivered effectively into the nucleus without influencing the cell viability, and work as interactomic inhibitors via disruption of the endogenous p65-mediated transcription complex. nt-p65-TMD effectively inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or IL-6 from BV2 microglia cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). nt-p65-TMD did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling mediators such as ZAP-70, p38, JNK, or ERK involved in T cell activation, but was capable of suppressing the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB without the functional effect on that of NFAT upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. The transduced nt-p65-TMD in T cell did not affect the expression of CD69, however significantly inhibited the secretion of T cell-specific cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17A, or IL-10. Systemic administration of nt-p65-TMD showed a significant therapeutic effect on LPS-induced sepsis model by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Therefore, nt-p65-TMD can be a novel therapeutics for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, where a transcription factor has a key role in pathogenesis, and further allows us to discover new functions of p65 under normal physiological condition without genetic alteration.", "Keywords": ["Inflammation", "Intra-nucleus delivery", "NF-\u03baB", "RelA (p65)", "Sepsis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "NF-kappa B", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Recombinant Proteins", "Sepsis", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transcription Factor RelA", "Transcription, Genetic", "Transduction, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sung-Dong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "So Yeong", "Last Name": "Cheon", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Anesthesia and Pain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae-Yoon", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Bo-Young", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyunju", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bon-Nyeo", "Last Name": "Koo", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Anesthesia and Pain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Republic of Korea.

Different scientific evidences suggest that the entire human population descended from just several thousand African migrants. About 85,000 years ago, the first wave of human migration was out of Africa, that followed the coasts through the Middle East, into Southern Asia via Sri Lanka, and in due course around Indonesia and into Australia. Another wave of migration between 40,000 and 12,000 years ago brought humans northward into Europe. However, the frozen north limited human expansion in Europe, and created a land bridge, \"Bering land bridge\", connecting Asia with North America about 25,000 years ago. Although fossil data give the most direct information about our past, it has certain anomalies. So, molecular archeologists are now using different molecular markers to trace the \"most recent common ancestor\" and also the migration pattern of modern humans. In this study, we have studied the trend of molecular markers and also the methodologies implemented in the last decades (2003-2014). From our observation, we can say that D-loop region of mtDNA and Y chromosome based markers are predominant. Nevertheless, mtDNA, especially the D-loop region, has some unique features, which makes it a more effective marker for tracing prehistoric footprints of modern human populations. Although, natural selection should also be taken into account in studying mtDNA based human migration.

Here, we investigated, through DNA Barcoding and morphological assessment, the identification of 128 ornamental fish specimens exported from NE India from different exporters. The generated sequences were subjected to similarity match in BOLD-IDS as well as BLASTN, and analysed using MEGA5.2 for species identification through Neighbour-Joining (NJ) clustering, and K2P distance based approach. The analysis revealed straightforward identification of 84 specimens into 35 species, while 44 specimens were difficult to distinguish based on CO1 barcode alone. However, these cases were resolved through morphology, NJ and distanced based method and found to be belonging to 16 species. Among the 51 identified species, 14 species represented multiple trade names; 17 species belonged to threatened category.

HPV was detected in 37% of cases, with HPV-18 as the major high-risk sub-type. Although HPV presence did not seem to affect survival in overall UADT cancers, but was associated with a favourable prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters with different methylation profile and HPV presence. Among these, the CIMP-high subgroup exhibited the highest HPV positive cases (66%).

Surprisingly, epithelial IL-1\u03b2 is induced by DNA damage via an NF-\u03baB-independent mechanism. Tissue damage caused by gut barrier disruption is exacerbated in the absence of NF-\u03baB, with failure to express the endogenous IL-1\u03b2 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra upon four-allele loss. Antibody neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 prevents epithelial tight junction dysfunction and alleviates mucositis in \u03b2-TrCP-deficient mice. IL-1\u03b2 antagonists should thus be considered for prevention and treatment of severe morbidity associated with mucositis.", "Keywords": ["anakinra", "anti\u2013IL-1 preventive therapy", "cytotoxic side effects", "graft-vs.-host disease", "gut immunity"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "DNA Damage", "DNA Primers", "Interleukin-1beta", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitosis", "Mucositis", "NF-kappa B", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naama", "Last Name": "Kanarek", "Affiliation": "Lautenberg Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Sergei I", "Last Name": "Grivennikov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Leshets", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Audrey", "Last Name": "Lasry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irit", "Last Name": "Alkalay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elad", "Last Name": "Horwitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yoav D", "Last Name": "Shaul", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Stachler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Voronov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ron N", "Last Name": "Apte", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Pagano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eli", "Last Name": "Pikarsky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Karin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yinon", "Last Name": "Ben-Neriah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014Feb11"}, {"PMID": "24409929", "Title": "Unraveling the sequence information in COI barcode to achieve higher taxon assignment based on Indian freshwater fishes.", "Abstract": "Efficacy of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA barcode in higher taxon assignment is still under debate in spite of several attempts, using the conventional DNA barcoding methods, to assign higher taxa.

The congeneric and conspecific genetic divergences were calculated using Kimura's 2 parameter distance model followed by the construction of a Neighbor Joining tree using the MEGA 5.1. DNA barcoding principle at its first hand approach, led to the straightforward identification of 82% of the studied species with 2.9% (S.E=0.2) divergence between the nearest congeners. However, after validating some cases of synonymy and mislabeled sequences, 5% more species were found to be valid. Sequences submitted to the database under different names were found to represent single species. On the other hand, some sequences of the species like Barilius barna, Barilius bendelisis and Labeo bata were submitted to the database under a single name but were found to represent either some unexplored species or latent species. Overall, 87% of the available Indian freshwater fish barcodes were diagnosed as true species in parity with the existing checklist and can act as reference barcode for the particular taxa.

However, short fragments of DNA may be recovered, which would significantly improve many unresolved taxonomic conflicts. Here, we designed a mini-barcode for catfishes comprising several species and many cryptic taxa. We analysed a data set of 3048 publicly available COI barcode sequences representing 547 worldwide catfish species and performed 152 628 interspecies comparisons. A significantly more positively correlated interspecies distance was detected with transversion (0.78, P < 0.001) than with transition (0.70, P < 0.001). This suggested that transversions were better diagnostics for species identification. In the aligned data set, two transversion-rich fragments (53 bp and 119 bp) were identified. Transition/transversion bias value was 1.04 in 53-bp fragment, 1.23 in 119-bp fragment and 1.50 in full-length barcode. The interspecies distance with full-length barcode was 0.212 \u00b1 0.037, while that with 53-bp and 119-bp fragments was 0.325 \u00b1 0.039 and 0.218 \u00b1 0.045, respectively. Survey of 53-bp fragment showed a possibility of only 1144 barcodes, while that of 119-bp fragment showed >4 million barcodes. Thus, the 119-bp fragment is a viable mini-barcode for catfishes comprising >3000 extant species. Experiment with 82 archived catfishes showed successful recovery of this mini-barcode using the designed primer.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) acts as a scaffold by binding both protein kinase C\u03b8 (PKC\u03b8) and CARMA1, and is therefore essential for signaling to NF-\u03baB. In this article, we demonstrate the importance of PDK1 Thr(513) phosphorylation in regulating the intermolecular organization of PDK1 homodimers. Thr(513) is directly involved in heterotypic PDK1 homodimer formation, in which binding is mediated through the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domains. Upon activation, phosphorylated Thr(513) instead mediates homotypic intermolecular binding through the PH domains. Consequently, cell-permeable peptides with a Thr(513) to Ile derivative (protein transduction domain [PTD]-PDK1-Thr(513)-Ile) bound the kinase domain, whereas a Thr(513)-to-Asp peptide (PTD-PDK1-Thr(513)-Asp) bound the PH domain. PTD-PDK1-Thr(513)-Ile blocked binding between PDK1 and PKC\u03b8, phosphorylation of PKC\u03b8 Thr(538), and activation of both NF-\u03baB and AKT. In contrast, PTD-PDK1- Thr(513)-Asp selectively inhibited binding between PDK1 and CARMA1, and blocked TCR/CD28-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, Thr(513) phosphorylation regulates a critical intermolecular switch governing PDK1 homodimer structure and the capacity to interact with downstream signaling pathway components.

Therefore, utilization of such technique in association with the traditional morphotaxonomic description can resolve the species dilemma of this important group of sport fishes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Cyprinidae", "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic", "Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Boni A", "Last Name": "Laskar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}, {"First Name": "Maloyjo J", "Last Name": "Bhattacharjee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bishal", "Last Name": "Dhar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pradosh", "Last Name": "Mahadani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shantanu", "Last Name": "Kundu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sankar K", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23290966", "Title": "Combined action of nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors and TLR11/TLR12 heterodimers imparts resistance to Toxoplasma gondii in mice.", "Abstract": "\"Triple-defective\" (3d) mice carrying a mutation in UNC93B1, a chaperone for the endosomal nucleic acid-sensing (NAS) Toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, are highly susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii infection. However, none of the single or even the triple NAS-TLR-deficient animals recapitulated the 3d susceptible phenotype to experimental toxoplasmosis. Investigating this further, we found that while parasite RNA and DNA activate innate immune responses via TLR7 and TLR9, TLR11 and TLR12 working as heterodimers are required for sensing and responding to Toxoplasma profilin. Consequently, the triple TLR7/TLR9/TLR11-deficient mice are highly susceptible to T.\u00a0gondii infection, recapitulating the phenotype of 3d mice. Humans lack functional TLR11 and TLR12 genes.

However, in a phenomenon known as LPS tolerance, prolonged exposure to LPS reprograms the host response to subsequent LPS reexposure. Proinflammatory cytokine production is suppressed, while production of antimicrobial genes is increased. In vivo models suggest that LPS tolerance dramatically reduces susceptibility to septic shock, while keeping the capacity for clearance of certain pathogens intact. These observations imply that artificial induction of tolerance may be an attractive means to intervene in the progression of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms that govern the tolerogenic response remain poorly understood, hindering efforts to evaluate LPS tolerance induction as a therapeutic approach. Recent advances indicate that chromatin modifications and microRNA mediators may be particularly important in the tolerogenic response. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms to account for the phenomenon of LPS tolerance, with particular emphasis on the role of newly identified mediators.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Cell Nucleus", "Chromatin", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Histones", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "MicroRNAs", "NF-kappa B", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "Seeley", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032 sg2715@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23265943", "Title": "Association of mitochondrial D-loop mutations with GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms in oral carcinoma: a case control study from northeast India.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cancer cells.

TLR12 was sufficient for recognition of TgPRF by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), whereas TLR11 and TLR12 were both required in macrophages and conventional DCs. In contrast to TLR11, TLR12-deficient mice succumb rapidly to T.\u00a0gondii infection. TLR12-dependent induction of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b1 in pDCs led to production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells. Consistent with this observation, the partial resistance of Tlr11(-/-) mice is lost upon pDC or NK cell depletion. Thus, TLR12 is critical for the innate immune response to T.\u00a0gondii, and this TLR may promote host resistance by triggering pDC and NK cell function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Dendritic Cells", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Immunity, Innate", "Interferon-alpha", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-12", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Molecular Sequence Data", "NF-kappa B", "Profilins", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Sequence Alignment", "Toll-Like Receptors", "Toxoplasma", "Toxoplasmosis, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "A Alicia", "Last Name": "Koblansky", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dragana", "Last Name": "Jankovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hyunju", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Hieny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Waradon", "Last Name": "Sungnak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ramkumar", "Last Name": "Mathur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Hayden", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shizuo", "Last Name": "Akira", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Sher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Immunity", "PubDate": "2013Jan24"}]
