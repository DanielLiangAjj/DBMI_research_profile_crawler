Two groups of patients with PitNETs were sequenced: a prospective group of patients (n\u2009=\u200966) who consented to sequencing prior to surgery and a retrospective group (n\u2009=\u200926) comprised of aggressive/higher risk PitNETs. A higher mutational burden and fraction of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in the aggressive, treatment-refractory PitNETs compared to the benign tumors (p\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10 and p\u2009=\u20098.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9, respectively). Within the corticotroph lineage, a characteristic pattern of recurrent chromosomal LOH in 12 specific chromosomes was associated with treatment-refractoriness (occurring in 11 of 14 treatment-refractory versus 1 of 14 benign corticotroph PitNETs, p\u2009=\u20091.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Across the cohort, a higher fraction of LOH was identified in tumors with TP53 mutations (p\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). A machine learning approach identified loss of heterozygosity as the most predictive variable for aggressive, treatment-refractory behavior, outperforming the most common gene-level alteration, TP53, with an accuracy of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-0.96). Aggressive, treatment-refractory PitNETs are characterized by significant aneuploidy due to widespread chromosomal LOH, most prominently in the corticotroph tumors. This LOH predicts treatment-refractoriness with high accuracy and represents a novel biomarker for this poorly defined PitNET category.", "Keywords": ["Aggressive pituitary tumor", "Pituitary carcinoma", "Pituitary neuroendocrine tumor", "Treatment-refractory pituitary tumor"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Loss of Heterozygosity", "Pituitary Neoplasms", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Male", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Adult", "Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Mutation", "Prospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew L", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vasilisa A", "Last Name": "Rudneva", "Affiliation": "Marie-Jos\u00e9e and Henry R.

We found that \u03b1-MSH was highly expressed in the mouse heart with reduced ventricular levels after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Administration of a stable \u03b1-MSH analog protected mice against TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. In vitro experiments revealed that MC5-R in cardiomyocytes mediates the anti-hypertrophic signaling of \u03b1-MSH. Silencing of MC5-R in cardiomyocytes induced hypertrophy and fibrosis markers in vitro and aggravated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo. Conversely, pharmacological activation of MC5-R improved systolic function and reduced cardiac fibrosis in TAC-operated mice. In conclusion, \u03b1-MSH is expressed in the heart and protects against pathological cardiac remodeling by activating MC5-R in cardiomyocytes.

However, these neuronal cells encompass heterogeneous subpopulations that release \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, or both neurotransmitters, whose functions are poorly defined. Using conditional mutagenesis and chemogenetics, we show that blockade of the energy sensor mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in POMC neurons causes hyperphagia by mimicking a cellular negative energy state. This is associated with decreased POMC-derived anorexigenic \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and recruitment of POMC/GABAergic neurotransmission, which is restrained by cannabinoid type 1 receptor signaling. Electrophysiology and optogenetic studies further reveal that pharmacological blockade of mTORC1 simultaneously activates POMC/GABAergic neurons and inhibits POMC/glutamatergic ones, implying that the functional specificity of these subpopulations relies on mTORC1 activity. Finally, POMC neurons with different neurotransmitter profiles possess specific molecular signatures and spatial distribution.

The objective of this study was to measure the POMC prohormone and its processed peptide, \u03b2-endorphin (\u03b2-EP), in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and AgRP in CSF and plasma after calorie restriction to validate their utility as biomarkers of brain melanocortin activity. CSF and plasma were obtained from 10 lean and obese subjects after fasting (40 h) and refeeding (24 h), and from 8 obese subjects before and after 6 wk of dieting (800 kcal/day) to assess changes in neuropeptide and hormone levels. After fasting, plasma leptin decreased to 35%, and AgRP increased to 153% of baseline. During refeeding, AgRP declined as leptin increased; CSF \u03b2-EP increased, but POMC did not change. Relative changes in plasma and CSF leptin were blunted in obese subjects. After dieting, plasma and CSF leptin decreased to 46% and 70% of baseline, CSF POMC and \u03b2-EP decreased, and plasma AgRP increased. At baseline, AgRP correlated negatively with insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and positively with the Matsuda index.

In contrast, multiple enhancers drive similar expression patterns of some genes involved in embryonic development, suggesting regulatory redundancy. Work in Drosophila has indicated that functionally overlapping enhancers canalize development by buffering gene expression against environmental and genetic disturbances. However, little is known about regulatory redundancy in vertebrates and in genes mainly expressed during adulthood. Here we study nPE1 and nPE2, two phylogenetically conserved mammalian enhancers that drive expression of the proopiomelanocortin gene (Pomc) to the same set of hypothalamic neurons. The simultaneous deletion of both enhancers abolished Pomc expression at all ages and induced a profound metabolic dysfunction including early-onset extreme obesity. Targeted inactivation of either nPE1 or nPE2 led to very low levels of Pomc expression during early embryonic development indicating that both enhancers function synergistically. In adult mice, however, Pomc expression is controlled additively by both enhancers, with nPE1 being responsible for \u223c80% and nPE2 for \u223c20% of Pomc transcription. Consequently, nPE1 knockout mice exhibit mild obesity whereas nPE2-deficient mice maintain a normal body weight. These results suggest that nPE2-driven Pomc expression is compensated by nPE1 at later stages of development, essentially rescuing the earlier phenotype of nPE2 deficiency. Together, these results reveal that cooperative interactions between the enhancers confer robustness of Pomc expression against gene regulatory disturbances and preclude deleterious metabolic phenotypes caused by Pomc deficiency in adulthood. Thus, our study demonstrates that enhancer redundancy can be used by genes that control adult physiology in mammals and underlines the potential significance of regulatory sequence mutations in common diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Conserved Sequence", "Embryonic Development", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Evolution, Molecular", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Mammals", "Mice", "Neurons", "Phylogeny", "Pregnancy", "Pro-Opiomelanocortin", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel D", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Flavio S J", "Last Name": "de Souza", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenier\u00eda Gen\u00e9tica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Sofia", "Last Name": "Nasif", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenier\u00eda Gen\u00e9tica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Miho", "Last Name": "Yamashita", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rodrigo", "Last Name": "L\u00f3pez-Leal", "Affiliation": "Centro de Estudios Cient\u00edficos, Valdivia, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Veronica", "Last Name": "Otero-Corchon", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kana", "Last Name": "Meece", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Harini", "Last Name": "Sampath", "Affiliation": "Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Aaron J", "Last Name": "Mercer", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sharon L", "Last Name": "Wardlaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Marcelo", "Last Name": "Rubinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America; Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenier\u00eda Gen\u00e9tica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Malcolm J", "Last Name": "Low", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2015Feb"}, {"PMID": "25555215", "Title": "Differentiation of hypothalamic-like neurons from human pluripotent stem cells.", "Abstract": "The hypothalamus is the central regulator of systemic energy homeostasis, and its dysfunction can result in extreme body weight alterations.

In both diet-induced obese (DIO) and leptin-deficient mice, TTP2515 decreased food intake, weight gain, adiposity and respiratory quotient. TTP2515 potently suppressed food intake and weight gain in lean mice immediately after initiation of a high fat diet (HFD) but had no effect on these parameters in lean chow-fed mice. However, when tested in AgRP KO mice, TTP2515 also suppressed food intake and weight gain during HFD feeding. In several studies TTP2515 increased T4 but not T3 levels, however this was also observed in AgRP KO mice. TTP2515 also attenuated refeeding and weight gain after fasting, an effect not evident in AgRP KO mice when administered at moderate doses. This study shows that TTP2515 exerts many effects consistent with AgRP inhibition however experiments in AgRP KO mice indicate some off-target effects of this drug. TTP2515 was particularly effective during fasting and in mice with leptin deficiency, conditions in which AgRP is elevated, as well as during acute and chronic HFD feeding. Thus the usefulness of this drug in treating obesity deserves further exploration, to define the AgRP dependent and independent mechanisms by which TTP2515 exerts its effects on energy balance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adiposity", "Administration, Oral", "Agouti-Related Protein", "Animals", "Anti-Obesity Agents", "Diet, High-Fat", "Eating", "Energy Metabolism", "Humans", "Leptin", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Rats", "Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4", "Thyroxine", "Triiodothyronine", "Weight Gain", "alpha-MSH"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roxanne", "Last Name": "Dutia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrea J", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Modes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Rothlein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jane M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ye Edward", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jumana", "Last Name": "Ihbais", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sam F", "Last Name": "Victory", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Valcarce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharon L", "Last Name": "Wardlaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23403926", "Title": "pRb is an obesity suppressor in hypothalamus and high-fat diet inhibits pRb in this location.", "Abstract": "pRb is frequently inactivated in tumours by mutations or phosphorylation. Here, we investigated whether pRb plays a role in obesity. The Arcuate nucleus (ARC) in hypothalamus contains antagonizing POMC and AGRP/NPY neurons for negative and positive energy balance, respectively. Various aspects of ARC neurons are affected in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mouse model. Using this model, we show that HFD, as well as pharmacological activation of AMPK, induces pRb phosphorylation and E2F target gene de-repression in ARC neurons. Some affected neurons express POMC; and deleting Rb1 in POMC neurons induces E2F target gene de-repression, cell-cycle re-entry, apoptosis, and a hyperphagia-obesity-diabetes syndrome. These defects can be corrected by combined deletion of E2f1. In contrast, deleting Rb1 in the antagonizing AGRP/NPY neurons shows no effects. Thus, pRb-E2F1 is an obesity suppression mechanism in ARC POMC neurons and HFD-AMPK inhibits this mechanism by phosphorylating pRb in this location.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenylate Kinase", "Animals", "Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus", "Diet, High-Fat", "Dietary Fats", "Down-Regulation", "E2F1 Transcription Factor", "Female", "Hypothalamus", "Ideal Body Weight", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Obesity", "Phosphorylation", "Pro-Opiomelanocortin", "Retinoblastoma Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhonglei", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Genevieve", "Last Name": "Marcelin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frederick", "Last Name": "Bauzon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongbo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Siok Le", "Last Name": "Dun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongling", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaosong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Young-Hwan", "Last Name": "Jo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Wardlaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nae", "Last Name": "Dun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Streamson", "Last Name": "Chua", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The EMBO journal", "PubDate": "2013Mar20"}, {"PMID": "23118421", "Title": "Cerebrospinal fluid levels of leptin, proopiomelanocortin, and agouti-related protein in human pregnancy: evidence for leptin resistance.", "Abstract": "Leptin suppresses appetite by modulating the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides including proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP).
