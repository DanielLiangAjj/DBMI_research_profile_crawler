A population of neurons in the lateral central amygdala (CeAL) expressing corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) have been proposed to be key in processing threat of different intensities to mediate active fear expression. Here, we use in vivo fiber photometry to show that ELA results in sex-specific changes in the activity of CeAL CRF+ neurons, yielding divergent mechanisms underlying the augmented startle in ELA mice, a translationally relevant behavior indicative of heightened threat reactivity and hypervigilance. Further, chemogenic inhibition of CeAL CRF+ neurons selectively diminishes startle and produces a long-lasting suppression of threat reactivity. These findings identify a mechanism for sex-differences in susceptibility for anxiety following ELA and have broad implications for understanding the neural circuitry that encodes and gates the behavioral expression of fear.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Fear", "Neurons", "Mice", "Female", "Male", "Anxiety", "Central Amygdaloid Nucleus", "Reflex, Startle", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Behavior, Animal", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Camila", "Last Name": "Demaestri", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaux", "Last Name": "Pisciotta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Behavior, Barnard College of Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naira", "Last Name": "Altunkeser", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Georgia", "Last Name": "Berry", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Hyland", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jocelyn", "Last Name": "Breton", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Darling", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brenna", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Cellular and Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin G", "Last Name": "Bath", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA.

The goals of this study were two-fold; First, to test if male and female mice employed different coping strategies in response to threat learning using different conditioning parameters (low, medium, and high intensity foot shocks). Second, to test if ELA in the form of limited bedding and nesting (LBN) altered the behavioral response of mice to conditioning. Mice received 6 tone/foot-shock pairings at one of three different foot-shock intensities (0.35\u2009mA; 0.57\u2009mA; 0.7\u2009mA). Freezing, darting, and foot-shock reactivity were measured across trials. During conditioning, control-reared female mice exhibited significantly higher rates of darting behavior compared to control males at nearly all shock intensities tested. LBN rearing decreased the proportion of darting females to levels observed in males. Thus, ELA in the form of LBN significantly diminished the recruitment of active versus passive coping strategies in female mice but did not generally change male responding.

Depression is a complex disorder with varied symptoms across patients. However, feeling of sadness and decreased motivation, and diminished feeling of pleasure (anhedonia) appear to be core to most depressive pathology. Odorants are potent signals that serve a critical role in social interactions, avoiding danger, and consummatory behaviors. Diminished quality of olfactory function is associated with negative effects on quality of life leading to and aggravating the symptoms of depression. Odor hedonic value (I like or I dislike this smell) is a dominant feature of olfaction and guides approach or avoidance behavior of the odor source. The neural representation of the hedonic value of odorants is carried by the granule cells in the olfactory bulb, which functions to modulate the cortical relay of olfactory information. The granule cells of the olfactory bulb and those of the dentate gyrus are the two major populations of cells in the adult brain with continued neurogenesis into adulthood. In hippocampus, decreased neurogenesis has been linked to development or maintenance of depression symptoms. Here, we hypothesize that chronic mild stress can alter olfactory hedonics through effects on the olfactory bulb neurogenesis, contributing to the broader anhedonia phenotype in stress-associated depression. To test this, mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress and then tested on measures of depressive-like behaviors, odor hedonics, and measures of olfactory neurogenesis. Chronic unpredictable mild stress led to a selective effect on odor hedonics, diminishing attraction to pleasant but not unpleasant odorants, an effect that was accompanied by a specific decrease in adult neurogenesis and of the percentage of adult-born cells responding to pleasant odorants in the olfactory bulb.", "Keywords": ["adult neurogenesis", "chronic mild stress", "emotional alteration", "odor hedonics", "olfactory bulb"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Athanassi", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Neuropop Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Marine", "Last Name": "Breton", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Neuropop Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Chalen\u00e7on", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Neuropop Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "J\u00e9rome", "Last Name": "Brunelin", "Affiliation": "Centre Hospitalier Le Vinatier, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Didier", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Neuropop Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Bath", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Mandairon", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Neuropop Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 Jean Monnet, Bron, France."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37502995", "Title": "Early life adversity reduces affiliative behavior towards a distressed cagemate and leads to sex-specific alterations in corticosterone responses.", "Abstract": "Experiencing early life adversity (ELA) alters stress physiology and increases the risk for developing psychiatric disorders.

Neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes following ELA are multifaceted and are influenced heavily by the type of adversity experienced and sex of the individual experiencing ELA. It remains unclear what properties of ELA portend differential neurobiological risk and the basis of sex-differences for negative outcomes. Predictability of the postnatal environment has emerged as being a core feature supporting development, with the most salient signals deriving from parental care. Predictability of parental care may be a distinguishing feature of different forms of ELA, and the degree of predictability afforded by these manipulations may contribute to the diversity of outcomes observed across models. Further, questions remain as to whether differing levels of predictability may contribute to differential effects on neurodevelopment and expression of genes associated with risk for pathology. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in maternal behavior in mice would be contingent on the type of ELA experienced, directly comparing predictability of care in the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) and maternal separation (MS) paradigms. We then tested whether the predictability of the ELA environment altered the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), a sexually-dimorphic neuropeptide that regulates threat-related learning, in the amygdala of male and female mice. The LBN manipulation reliably increased the entropy of maternal care, a measure that indicates lower predictability between sequences of dam behavior. LBN and MS rearing similarly increased the frequency of nest sorties and licking of pups but had mixed effects on other aspects of dam-, pup-, and nest-related behaviors. Increased expression of Crh-related genes was observed in pups that experienced ELA, with gene expression measures showing a significant interaction with sex and type of ELA manipulation. Specifically, MS was associated with increased expression of Crh-related genes in males, but not females, and LBN primarily increased expression of these genes in females, but not males.

Four cell-specific sites of alternative splicing in Cacna1b that alter CaV2.2 channel function have been described in detail: three cassette exons (e18a, e24a, and e31a) and a pair of mutually exclusive exons (e37a/e37b).

ELS animals weighed significantly less than controls at every timepoint measured. Onset of vaginal opening was tracked from P21 to 40, and ELS was found to significantly delay the onset of vaginal opening. To test the impact of ELS on estrous cycle duration and regularity, vaginal cytology was assessed in independent groups of animals using either a continuous sampling (daily from P40 to P57) or random sampling approach (single swab at P35, P50, or P75). ELS did impact measures of estrous cycling, but these effects were dependent upon the sampling method used. We also tested the impact of ELS on anxiety-like behaviors over development and across the estrous cycle. We observed a developmental increase in anxiety-like behavior in control but not ELS mice. No effect of estrous cycle stage was found on anxiety-like behavior for either group of mice. Together these results provide evidence that ELS in the form of LB delays somatic and sexual development.

Until now, mouse models of depression have been largely unsuccessful at replicating the diverse symptomatology of this disease and the sex bias in vulnerability. From P4 to P11, a limited bedding model that leads to fragmented maternal care, was used to induce ELS. Early adolescent and young adult mice were tested on an array of assays to test for depressive-like behavior. This included our newly developed automated home cage behavioral recognition system, where the home cage behavior of ELS and control mice could be monitored over a continuous 5-10\u2009day span. ELS females, but not males, exhibited depressive-like behaviors on traditional assays. These effects emerged during adolescence and became more severe in adulthood. Using the novel home cage video monitoring method, we identified robust and continuous markers of depressive-like pathology in ELS females that phenocopy many of the behavioral characteristics of depression in humans. ELS effects on home cage behavior were rapidly rescued by ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant. Together, these findings highlight that limited bedding ELS (1) produces an early emerging, female-specific depressive phenotype that responds to a fast-acting antidepressant and (2) this model has the potential to inform sex-selective risk for the development of stress-induced mental illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Antidepressive Agents", "Behavior, Animal", "Depression", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Ketamine", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Sex Characteristics", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haley L", "Last Name": "Goodwill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela", "Last Name": "Manzano-Nieves", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Gallo", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hye-In", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Esther", "Last Name": "Oyerinde", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Serre", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin G", "Last Name": "Bath", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912, USA.

We tested the impact of a limited bedding paradigm of ELS (from P4-11) on contextual threat learning, context memory, footshock sensitivity, and anxietylike behavior, in adult male and female mice. To examine contextual threat learning, mice conditioned by context/footshock association were tested 24 hr later for the context memory. To determine the effect of ELS on footshock sensitivity, a separate cohort of mice were exposed to footshocks of increasing intensity (0.06 to 0.40 mA) and behavioral responses (jump and audible vocalization) were assessed by observers blind to treatment condition, sex, and cycle stage. ELS impaired context memory in female, but not male, mice. ELS increased footshock-induced threshold to vocalize, but not to jump, in both sexes. In female mice, this effect was most apparent during estrus. Decreased body weight, indicative of higher stress incurred by an individual mouse, correlated with increased threshold to jump in both sexes reared in ELS, and to audibly vocalize in ELS females. As ELS effects on shock sensitivity were present in both sexes, the contextual recall deficit in females was not likely driven by changes in the salience of aversive footshocks. No effects on anxietylike behavior, as measured in the elevated plus maze (EPM), were observed. More work is needed to better understand the impact of ELS on both somatic and gonadal development, and their potential contribution to threat learning.

The focus of the symposium was \"Stress and the Synapse: New Concepts and Methods\" and featured the work of several junior investigators. The presentations focused on the impact of various forms of stress (altered maternal care, binge alcohol drinking, chronic social defeat, and chronic unpredictable stress) on synaptic function, neurodevelopment, and behavioral outcomes. One of the goals of the symposium was to highlight the mechanisms accounting for how the nervous system responds to stress and their impact on outcome measures with converging effects on the development of pathological behavior. Dr. Kevin Bath's presentation focused on the impact of disruptions in early maternal care and its impact on the timing of hippocampus maturation in mice, finding that this form of stress drove accelerated synaptic and behavioral maturation, and contributed to the later emergence of risk for cognitive and emotional disturbance. Dr. Scott Russo highlighted the impact of chronic social defeat stress in adolescent mice on the development and plasticity of reward circuity, with a focus on glutamatergic development in the nucleus accumbens and mesolimbic dopamine system, and the implications of these changes for disruptions in social and hedonic response, key processes disturbed in depressive pathology. Dr. Kristen Pleil described synaptic changes in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis that underlie the behavioral consequences of allostatic load produced by repeated cycles of alcohol binge drinking and withdrawal. Dr. Eric Wohleb and Dr. Ron Duman provided new data associating decreased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and neurobiological changes in the synapses in response to chronic unpredictable stress, and highlighted the potential for the novel antidepressant ketamine to rescue synaptic and behavioral effects.

Even relatively brief periods of stress during the first 10\u00a0days of life in rodents can impact later behavioral regulation and the vulnerability to develop adult pathologies, in particular an impairment of cognitive functions and neurogenesis, but also modified social, emotional, and conditioned fear responses. The development of preclinical models of ELS exposure allows the examination of mechanisms and testing of therapeutic approaches that are not possible in humans. Here, we describe limited bedding and nesting (LBN) procedures, with models that produce altered maternal behavior ranging from fragmentation of care to maltreatment of infants. The purpose of this paper is to discuss important issues related to the implementation of this chronic ELS procedure and to describe some of the most prominent endpoints and consequences, focusing on areas of convergence between laboratories. Effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, gut axis and metabolism are presented in addition to changes in cognitive and emotional functions. Interestingly, recent data have suggested a strong sex difference in some of the reported consequences of the LBN paradigm, with females being more resilient in general than males. As both the chronic and intermittent variants of the LBN procedure have profound consequences on the offspring with minimal external intervention from the investigator, this model is advantageous ecologically and has a large translational potential. In addition to the direct effect of ELS on neurodevelopmental outcomes, exposure to adverse early environments can also have intergenerational impacts on mental health and function in subsequent generation offspring. Thus, advancing our understanding of the effect of ELS on brain and behavioral development is of critical concern for the health and wellbeing of both the current population, and for generations to come.", "Keywords": ["Developmental programing", "early life stress", "limited bedding and nesting", "maternal behavior", "mental health", "neonatal stress", "vulnerability"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue, White", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Bedding and Linens", "Behavior, Animal", "Child Abuse", "Cognition", "Emotions", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Humans", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Maternal Behavior", "Models, Animal", "Nesting Behavior", "Neurogenesis", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Reproducibility of Results", "Resilience, Psychological", "Rodentia", "Sex Factors", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire-Dominique", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "a Department of Psychiatry , McGill University, Douglas Mental Health University Institute , Montreal , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kevin G", "Last Name": "Bath", "Affiliation": "b Department of Neuroscience , Brown University , Providence , RI , USA."}, {"First Name": "Marian", "Last Name": "Joels", "Affiliation": "c Department Translational Neuroscience , Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center , Utrecht , The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Aniko", "Last Name": "Korosi", "Affiliation": "d Brain Plasticity Group , Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Muriel", "Last Name": "Larauche", "Affiliation": "e G.

Significant sex disparities have been identified for affective pathology, with females having an increased risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorder. However, the effects of early life stress (ELS) on cognitive development have not been as well characterized, especially in reference to sex specific impacts of ELS on cognitive abilities over development. In mice, fragmented maternal care resulting from maternal bedding restriction, was used to induce ELS. The development of spatial abilities were tracked using a novel object placement (NOP) task at several different ages across early development (P21, P28, P38, P50, and P75). Male mice exposed to ELS showed significant impairments in the NOP task compared with control reared mice at all ages tested. In female mice, ELS led to impaired NOP performance immediately following weaning (P21) and during peri-adolescence (P38), but these effects did not persist into early adulthood. Prior work has implicated impaired hippocampus neurogenesis as a possible mediator of negative outcomes in ELS males. In the hippocampus of behaviorally na\u00efve animals there was a significant decrease in expression of Ki-67 (proliferative marker) and doublecortin (DCX-immature cell marker) as mice aged, and a more rapid developmental decline in these markers in ELS reared mice.

In recent years, prenatal exposure to valproate has been associated with teratogenic effects, limiting its use in women that are pregnant or of childbearing age.

Animal models allow us to test hypotheses regarding the potential effects of postnatal valproate exposure on neurobehavioral development, as well as identify potential mechanisms mediating observed effects. Here, we tested the effect of early postnatal (P4-P11) valproate exposure (100mg/kg and 200mg/kg) on motor and affective development in two strains of mice, SVE129 and C57Bl/6N. We also assessed the effect of early valproate exposure on regional BDNF protein levels, a potential target of valproate, and mediator of neurodevelopmental outcomes. We found that early life valproate exposure led to significant motor impairments in both SVE129 and C57Bl/6N mice. Both lines of mice showed significant delays in weight gain, as well as impairments in the righting reflex (P7-8), wire hang (P17), open field (P12 and P21), and rotarod (P25 and P45) tasks. Interestingly, some of the early locomotor effects were strain- and dose-dependent. We observed no effects of valproate on early markers of anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, early life valproate exposure had significant effects on regional BDNF expression, leading to a near 50% decrease in BDNF levels in the cerebellum of both strains of mice, while not impacting hippocampal BDNF protein levels.

Choice can proceed reflexively from previous actions and their associated outcomes, as captured by \"model-free\" learning algorithms, or flexibly from prospective consideration of outcomes that might occur, as captured by \"model-based\" learning algorithms. However, differential contributions of dopamine to these systems are poorly understood. Dopamine is widely thought to support model-free learning by modulating plasticity in striatum. Model-based learning may also be affected by these striatal effects, or by other dopaminergic effects elsewhere, notably on prefrontal working memory function. Indeed, prominent demonstrations linking striatal dopamine to putatively model-free learning did not rule out model-based effects, whereas other studies have reported dopaminergic modulation of verifiably model-based learning, but without distinguishing a prefrontal versus striatal locus. To clarify the relationships between dopamine, neural systems, and learning strategies, we combine a genetic association approach in humans with two well-studied reinforcement learning tasks: one isolating model-based from model-free behavior and the other sensitive to key aspects of striatal plasticity. Prefrontal function was indexed by a polymorphism in the COMT gene, differences of which reflect dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified in the human BDNF gene (BDNF Val66Met) that leads to decreased BDNF secretion and impairments in specific forms of fear learning in adult humans and genetically modified mice containing this SNP. As the emergence of anxiety and other fear-related disorders peaks during adolescence, we sought to better understand the impact of this BDNF SNP on fear learning during the transition through adolescence in BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice. Previously, we have shown that contextual fear expression is temporarily suppressed in wild-type mice during a distinct period in adolescence, but re-emerges at later, postadolescent ages. Until recently, it was unclear whether BDNF-TrkB signaling is involved in the modulation of hippocampal-dependent contextual fear learning and memory during this adolescent period. Here we show that in BDNF Val66Met mice, the presence of the Met allele does not alter contextual fear expression during adolescence, but when previously conditioned BDNF(Met/Met) mice are tested in adulthood, they fail to display the delayed expression of contextual fear compared to wild-type BDNF(Val/Val) controls, indicating that the Met allele may permanently alter hippocampal function, leading to persistent functioning that is indistinguishable from the adolescent state. Conversely, truncated TrkB receptor (TrkB.T1)-deficient (TrkB.T1(-/-)) mice, a genetic mouse model with increased BDNF-TrkB signaling through full-length TrkB receptors, exhibit an accelerated expression of contextual fear during adolescence compared to wild-type controls.

Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011).
