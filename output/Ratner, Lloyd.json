Furthermore, pathologic alterations underlying this potential disparity have not been systematically studied. We performed a retrospective clinical-pathological study of kidney transplant recipients who received kidney allografts from either Black (n\u2009=\u2009407) or White (n\u2009=\u20091,494) donors at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from 2005 to 2018, with median follow-up of 4.5\u2009years post-transplantation. Black donor race was independently associated with allograft failure (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20091.34, p\u2009= 0.02) and recipients of kidney allografts from Black donors had a higher incidence of collapsing glomerulopathy [7.4% vs. 1.9%, OR\u2009=\u20094.17, p\u2009< 0.001].

These findings revealed that, compared with recipients of kidney allografts from White donors, recipients of kidneys from Black donors have modestly shorter allograft survival and a higher probability of developing collapsing glomerulopathy, which negatively impacts allograft outcome.

In a 25-center cohort of ILDKT recipients transplanted between September 24, 1997, and December 15, 2016, we compared mortality, DCGF, delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), and length of stay (LOS) between 234 older (age \u226560 years) and 1172 younger (age 18-59 years) recipients. To investigate whether the impact of age was different for ILDKT recipients compared to 17 542 CLDKT recipients, we used an interaction term to determine whether the relationship between posttransplant outcomes and transplant type (ILDKT vs CLDKT) was modified by age. Overall, older recipients had higher mortality (hazard ratio: 1.632.072.65, P < .001), lower DCGF (hazard ratio: 0.360.530.77, P = .001), and AR (odds ratio: 0.390.540.74, P < .001), and similar DGF (odds ratio: 0.461.032.33, P = .9) and LOS (incidence rate ratio: 0.880.981.10, P = 0.8) compared to younger recipients.

In this report, we explored the reasons behind this guarded outcome with a special focus on the role of alloimmunity. We initially assessed gene expression in 39 time-zero allograft biopsies using the Nanostring 770 genes PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. Subsequently, we studied 696 consecutive adult kidney allograft recipients that were grouped according to allograft type and histology at time-zero biopsy [DRTx/suboptimal histology (n\u2009=\u2009194), DRTx/optimal histology (n\u2009=\u2009166), and LRTx (n\u2009=\u2009336)]. Part-1: Several immune pathways were upregulated in time-zero biopsies from DRTx/suboptimal histology (n\u2009=\u200911) compared to LRTx (n\u2009=\u200917) but not to DRTx/optimal histology (n\u2009=\u200911). Part-2: Amongst the three groups of recipients, DRTx/suboptimal histology had the highest incidence of acute rejection episodes, most of which occurred during the first year after transplantation (early rejection). This increase was mainly attributed to T cell mediated rejection, while the incidence of antibody-mediated rejection was similar amongst the three groups. Importantly, early acute T cell mediated rejection was a strong independent predictor for allograft failure in DRTx/suboptimal histology (adjusted HR: 2.13, P\u2009=\u20090.005) but not in DRTx/optimal histology nor in LRTx. Our data highlight an increased baseline immunogenicity in DRTx/suboptimal histology compared to LRTx but not to DRTx/optimal histology. However, our results suggest that donor chronic histologic changes in DRTx may help transfer such increased baseline immunogenicity into clinically relevant acute rejection episodes that have detrimental effects on allograft survival. These findings may provide a rationale for enhanced immunosuppression in recipients of DRTx with baseline chronic histologic changes to minimize subsequent acute rejection and to prolong allograft survival.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Allografts", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Kidney Transplantation", "Pilot Projects", "Retrospective Studies", "Tissue Donors", "Transcriptome",

donor kidney transplant recipients (ILDKTr) have pre-existing donor-specific antibody (DSA) that, despite desensitization, may persist or reappear with resulting consequences, including delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR). To quantify the risk of DGF and AR in ILDKT and downstream effects, we compared 1406 ILDKTr to 17\u00a0542 compatible LDKT recipients (CLDKTr) using a 25-center cohort with novel SRTR linkage. We characterized DSA strength as positive Luminex, negative flow crossmatch (PLNF); positive flow, negative cytotoxic crossmatch (PFNC); or positive cytotoxic crossmatch (PCC). DGF occurred in 3.1% of CLDKT, 3.5% of PLNF, 5.7% of PFNC, and 7.6% of PCC recipients, which translated to higher DGF for PCC recipients (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.03 1.682.72 ). However, the impact of DGF on mortality and DCGF risk was no higher for ILDKT than CLDKT (p interaction\u00a0>\u00a0.1). AR developed in 8.4% of CLDKT, 18.2% of PLNF, 21.3% of PFNC, and 21.7% of PCC recipients, which translated to higher AR (aOR PLNF\u00a0=\u00a01.45 2.093.02 ; PFNC\u00a0=\u00a01.67 2.403.46 ; PCC\u00a0=\u00a01.48 2.243.37 ). Although the impact of AR on mortality was no higher for ILDKT than CLDKT (p interaction\u00a0=\u00a0.1), its impact on DCGF risk was less consequential for ILDKT (aHR\u00a0=\u00a01.34 1.621.95 ) than CLDKT (aHR\u00a0=\u00a01.96 2.292.67 ) (p interaction\u00a0=\u00a0.004).

Despite nearly three decades of progress in the field, an archaic regulatory framework has stymied US clinical practice. Current regulations do not reflect the state-of-the-art in clinical or technical practices. In the US, islets are considered biologic drugs and \"more than minimally manipulated\" human cell and tissue products (HCT/Ps). In contrast, across the world, human islets are appropriately defined as \"minimally manipulated tissue\" and not regulated as a drug, which has led to islet allotransplantation (allo-ITx) becoming a standard-of-care procedure for selected patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This regulatory distinction impedes patient access to islets for transplantation in the US. As a result only 11 patients underwent allo-ITx in the US between 2016 and 2019, and all as investigational procedures in the settings of a clinical trials. Herein, we describe the current regulations pertaining to islet transplantation in the United States. We explore the progress which has been made in the field and demonstrate why the regulatory framework must be updated to both better reflect our current clinical practice and to deal with upcoming challenges. We propose specific updates to current regulations which are required for the renaissance of ethical, safe, effective, and affordable allo-ITx in the United States.", "Keywords": ["clinical

recipients. Thus, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 29 hospitalized SOT recipients who received tocilizumab for severe COVID-19, compared to a matched control group who did not. Among a total of 117 total SOT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19, 29 (24.8%) received tocilizumab. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher among patients who received tocilizumab (41%) compared to those who did not (20%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). When compared to control patients matched by age, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and administration of high dose corticosteroids, there was no significant difference in mortality (41% vs 28%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.27), hospital discharge (52% vs 72%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.26), or secondary infections (34% vs 24%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.55). Among patients who received tocilizumab, there was also no difference in mortality based on the level of oxygen support (intubated vs not intubated) at the time of tocilizumab initiation. In this matched cohort study, tocilizumab appeared to be safe but was not associated with decreased 90-day mortality. Larger randomized studies are needed to identify whether there are subsets of SOT recipients who may benefit from tocilizumab for treatment of COVID-19.", "Keywords": ["clinical research/practice",

Therapeutic donor nephrectomy can be successfully utilized for a heterogenous cohort of disease processes as both treatment for the donor and to increase the number of suitable organs available for transplantation. We describe four cases of therapeutic donor nephrectomy that were performed at our institution. Of the four cases, two patients elected to undergo therapeutic donor nephrectomy as treatment for loin pain hematuria syndrome; one after blunt abdominal trauma that resulted in complete proximal ureteral avulsion; and the fourth after being diagnosed with a small renal mass. Based on our data presented to the United Network for Organ Sharing Board of Directors (UNOS) in December 2015, living donor evaluation has been made simpler for patients electing to undergo therapeutic donor nephrectomy.

Since the inception of these center metrics, 1-year posttransplant graft and patient survival have improved, and center variation has decreased, casting uncertainty on their clinical relevance. The SRTR has recently modified center evaluations by ranking centers into 5 tiers rather than 3 tiers in an attempt to discriminate between programs performing within a tight range, further exacerbating this uncertainty. The American Society of Transplantation/American Society of Transplant Surgeons convened an expert taskforce to examine both the utility and unintended consequences of transplant center metrics. Estimates of center variation in outcomes in adjacent tiers are imprecise and fleeting, but can result in consequential changes in clinician and center behavior.

In total, 102 patients underwent desensitization. Posttransplant, 51 patients received standard of care (SOC) and 51 received eculizumab. The primary end point was week 9 posttransplant treatment failure rate, a composite of: biopsy-proven acute AMR (Banff 2007 grade II or III; assessed by blinded central pathology); graft loss; death; or loss to follow-up. Eculizumab was well tolerated with no new safety concerns. No significant difference in treatment failure rate was observed between eculizumab (9.8%) and SOC (13.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.760). To determine whether data assessment assumptions affected study outcome, biopsies were reanalyzed by central pathologists using clinical information. The resulting treatment failure rates were 11.8% and 21.6% for the eculizumab and SOC groups, respectively (nominal P\u00a0=\u00a0.288). When reassessment included grade I AMR, the treatment failure rates were 11.8% (eculizumab) and 29.4% (SOC; nominal P\u00a0=\u00a0.048).

Our initial two patients were successfully treated with a combination of surgical intervention followed by drain placement, after the failure of conservative management. The latter two cases were successfully treated with prompt intra-abdominal drain placement, without dietary modifications. Our cohort challenges the standard of care for treatment of chylous ascites after LLDN. We believe that prompt diagnosis and placement of an intra-abdominal drain can be used safely in select patients that develop this complication. We hypothesize that continuously draining the lymphatic leak, thus avoiding the re-accumulation of ascites, allows bowel and mesentery to make contact and adhere to the retroperitoneal tissue. We believe that prompt, initial, percutaneous drain placement is a viable alternative to both conservative and reoperative management in the treatment of chylous ascites after LLDN and should be

To assess the reasons for and probability of organ discard we assembled a cohort of 212,305 deceased donor kidneys recovered for transplant from 2000-2015 in the SRTR registry that included 36,700 kidneys that were discarded. 'Biopsy Findings' (38.2%) was the most commonly reported reason for discard. The median Kidney Donor Risk Index of discarded kidneys was significantly higher than transplanted organs (1.78 vs 1.12), but a large overlap in the quality of discarded and transplanted kidneys was observed. Kidneys of donors who were older, female, Black, obese, diabetic, hypertensive or HCV-positive experienced a significantly increased odds of discard. Kidneys from donors with multiple unfavorable characteristics were more likely to be discarded, whereas unilaterally discarded kidneys had the most desirable donor characteristics and the recipients of their partner kidneys experienced a one-year death-censored graft survival rate over 90%. There was considerable geographic variation in the odds of discard across the United States, which further supports the notion that factors beyond organ quality contributed to kidney discard. Thus, while the discard of a small fraction of organs procured from donors may be inevitable, the discard of potentially transplantable kidneys needs to be avoided. This will require a better understanding of the factors contributing to organ discard in order to remove the disincentives to utilize less-than-ideal organs for transplantation.", "Keywords": ["allocation", "biopsy", "deceased donors", "kidney transplantation", "organ discard"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Biopsy", "Donor Selection", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Odds Ratio", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Tissue Donors", "Treatment Outcome", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA; The Columbia University Renal Epidemiology (CURE) Group, New York, New York, USA.

Here, we used postreperfusion biopsies from patients who received kidney allografts from deceased donors between 2006 and 2009 to assess the impact of ischemia-reperfusion damage and myeloid dendritic cell density on subsequent allograft rejection episodes. Histologic changes of severe ischemia-reperfusion damage in postreperfusion biopsies were found to be associated with subsequent rejection episodes and suboptimal allograft survival. Using BDCA-1 as a marker of myeloid dendritic cells, postreperfusion biopsies from deceased donors had lower dendritic cell density compared to postreperfusion biopsies from living donors or normal controls. This suggests a rapid emigration of donor dendritic cells out of the allograft. In our cohort, low dendritic cell density was associated with a subsequent increase in rejection episodes. However, it appears that the donor's cause of death also influenced dendritic cell density. Therefore, we assessed the additive impact of severe ischemia-reperfusion changes and low dendritic cell density on subsequent rejection. The aforementioned combination was a powerful and independent predictor of allograft rejection. Thus, our data highlight the prognostic value of histopathologic changes associated with ischemia-reperfusion in postreperfusion biopsies and suggest a rapid posttransplant emigration of myeloid dendritic cells out of the allograft to enhance alloimmunity.

Recently, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) issued 5-tier ratings evaluating centers based on risk-adjusted 1-year graft survival. Our primary aim was to examine the reliability of 5-tier ratings over time. Using 10 consecutive PSRs for adult kidney transplant centers from June 2012 to December 2016 (n\u00a0=\u00a0208), we applied 5-tier ratings to center outcomes and evaluated ratings over time. From the baseline period (June 2012), 47% of centers had at least a 1-unit tier change within 6 months, 66% by 1 year, and 94% by 3 years. Similarly, 46% of centers had at least a 2-unit tier change by 3 years. In comparison, 15% of centers had a change in the traditional 3-tier rating at 3 years. The 5-tier ratings at 4 years had minimal association with baseline rating (Kappa 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.002 to 0.158). Centers had a median of 3 different 5-tier ratings over the period (q1\u00a0=\u00a02, q3\u00a0=\u00a04). Findings were consistent for center volume, transplant rate, and baseline 5-tier rating.

of deceased donor kidneys remain the most common reason cited for kidney discard. To determine the value of renal allograft histology in predicting outcomes, we evaluated the significance of histologic findings, read by experienced renal pathologists, in 975 postreperfusion biopsy specimens collected from 2005 to 2009 after living donor (n=427) or deceased donor (n=548) renal transplant. We evaluated specimens for the degree of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and vascular disease; specimens with a score of 0 or 1 (scale, 0-3) for each parameter were considered optimal. Overall, 66.3% of living donor kidneys and 50.7% of deceased donor kidneys received an optimal histology score (P<0.001). Irrespective of donor status, suboptimal kidneys came from older donors with a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity and a higher mean kidney donor risk index (all P<0.001). Death-censored outcomes after transplant differed significantly between optimal and suboptimal kidneys only in the deceased donor transplants (P=0.02). Regardless of histologic classification, outcomes with deceased donor kidneys were inferior to outcomes with living donor kidneys. However, 73.2% of deceased donor kidneys with suboptimal histology remained functional at 5 years. Our findings suggest that histologic findings on postreperfusion biopsy associate with outcomes after deceased donor but not living donor renal transplants, thus donor death and organ preservation-related factors may be of greater prognostic importance. Discarding donated kidneys on the basis of histologic factors may be inappropriate and merits further study.", "Keywords": ["kidney histology", "post-reperfusion biopsy", "renal transplantation", "transplant outcomes", "transplant pathology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biopsy", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Transplantation", "Living Donors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reperfusion", "Transplants", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York; sm2206@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Campenot", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "Mariana C", "Last Name": "Chiles", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dominick", "Last Name": "Santoriello", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Bland", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "R John", "Last Name": "Crew", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Rosenstiel", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey", "Last Name": "Dube", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ibrahim", "Last Name": "Batal", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "Jai", "Last Name": "Radhakrishnan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "P Rodrigo", "Last Name": "Sandoval", "Affiliation": "Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Guarrera", "Affiliation": "Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "M Barry", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "Vivette", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Glen", "Last Name": "Markowitz", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28279437", "Title": "Coronary Plaque Characteristics in Hemodialysis-Dependent Patients as Assessed by Optical\u00a0Coherence Tomography.", "Abstract": "Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean calcium arcs in culprit (54.3\u00b0 vs 26.4\u00b0, p\u00a0= 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3\u00b0 vs 24.5\u00b0, p\u00a0= 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments (101.6\u00b0 vs 0\u00b0, p\u00a0= 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium >30\u00b0 within intima <0.5\u00a0mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 4.8%, p\u00a0<0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p\u00a0= 0.049) but no differences in medial calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Angina, Stable", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Stenosis", "Coronary Vessels", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Propensity Score", "Renal Dialysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vascular Calcification"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chee Yang", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; Department of Cardiology, National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Mitsuaki", "Last Name": "Matsumura", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Akiko", "Last Name": "Maehara", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wenbin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cheolmin Tetsumin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Myong Hwa", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; Department of Cardiology, National Center for Cardiovascular Disease, China Peking Union Medical College, Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yasir", "Last Name": "Parviz", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nisha B", "Last Name": "Jhalani", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ori", "Last Name": "Ben-Yehuda", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gregg W", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Shlofmitz", "Affiliation": "St. Francis Hospital and Heart Center, Roslyn, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tsunekazu", "Last Name": "Kakuta", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Tsuchiura Kyodo General Hospital, Tsuchiura, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Gary S", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ziad A", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Clinical Trials Center, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York; Division of Cardiology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Using gut organoids derived from human iPS cells, we show that FOXO1 inhibition using a dominant-negative mutant or lentivirus-encoded small hairpin RNA promotes generation of insulin-positive cells that express all markers of mature pancreatic \u03b2-cells, release C-peptide in response to secretagogues and survive in vivo following transplantation into mice.

We enrolled 47 first-time adult transplant recipients managed with ECSW into a 1-year study to evaluate changes in bone mass, microarchitecture, biomechanical competence, and remodeling with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and bone turnover markers obtained at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Compared with baseline, 12-month areal bone mineral density by DXA did not change significantly at the spine and hip, but it declined significantly at the 1/3 and ultradistal radii (2.2% and 2.9%, respectively; both P<0.001). HRpQCT of the distal radius revealed declines in cortical area, density, and thickness (3.9%, 2.1%, and 3.1%, respectively; all P<0.001), trabecular density (4.4%; P<0.001), and stiffness and failure load (3.1% and 3.5%, respectively; both P<0.05). Findings were similar at the tibia. Increasing severity of hyperparathyroidism was associated with increased cortical losses. However, loss of trabecular bone and bone strength were most severe at the lowest and highest PTH levels. In summary, ECSW was associated with preservation of bone mineral density at the central skeleton; however, it was also associated with progressive declines in cortical and trabecular bone density at the peripheral skeleton. Cortical decreases related directly to PTH levels, whereas the relationship between PTH and trabecular bone decreases was bimodal. Studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic agents that suppress PTH will prevent cortical and trabecular losses and post-transplant fractures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Bone Density", "Bone Diseases", "Bone Remodeling", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glucocorticoids", "Graft Rejection", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Radiography", "Risk Factors", "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sapna P", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Oakland, California;"}, {"First Name": "Lucas E", "Last Name": "Nikkel", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Kyle K", "Last Name": "Nishiyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Elzbieta", "Last Name": "Dworakowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Boutroy", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale U1033, University of Lyon, Lyon, France;"}, {"First Name": "X Sherry", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Thomas L", "Last Name": "Nickolas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and tln2001@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}, {"PMID": "23924169", "Title": "An update to managing renal transplant ischemia reperfusion injury: novel therapies in the pipeline.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Postoperative Complications", "Reperfusion Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Demetra S", "Last Name": "Tsapepas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, New-York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. det9021@nyp.org."}, {"First Name": "Jaclyn T", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Spencer T", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Hardy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplantation", "PubDate": "2013Sep-Oct"}, {"PMID": "23614480", "Title": "Managing renal transplant ischemia reperfusion injury: novel therapies in the pipeline.", "Abstract": "Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is an early, non-specific inflammatory response that follows perfusion of warm blood into a cold asanguinous organ following transplantation. The occurrence of IRI may have a pivotal impact on acute and long-term renal allograft function. Initially, IRI contributes to delayed graft function (DGF), a term typically defined as the need for dialysis within one wk after renal transplantation. DGF frequently leads to prolonged hospital stay, increased healthcare costs, and potentially worse prognosis. Strategies to prevent IRI have so far been fairly limited, poorly defined, inadequately studied, and mostly anecdotal. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing and novel therapies, which may mitigate IRI in renal transplantation. Agents currently in the pipeline include: Diannexin, which reduces endothelial cell injury by shielding phosphatidylserine; YSPSL, which mimics the binding portion of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 to competitively inhibit translocation of P-selectin and recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the surface of endothelial cells; and I5NP, a synthetic small interfering ribonucleic acid that results in the inhibition of p53 expression. These agents represent an exciting frontier in transplant pharmacotherapy; they are in various phases of investigation and may have broader benefits in reducing complications of DGF.", "Keywords": ["delayed graft function", "drug development", "ischemia/reperfusion injury", "organ protection and preservation", "renal transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Disease Management", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Postoperative Complications", "Prognosis", "Reperfusion Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaclyn T", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. jtp9002@nyp.org"}, {"First Name": "Demetra S", "Last Name": "Tsapepas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Spencer T", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Hardy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplantation", "PubDate": "2013Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "23283136", "Title": "Pancreas-kidney transplantation is associated with reduced fracture risk compared with kidney-alone transplantation in men with type 1 diabetes.", "Abstract": "Both type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease are associated with increased fracture risk, likely because of metabolic abnormalities that reduce bone strength. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation is a treatment of choice for patients with both disorders, yet the effects of simultaneous pancreas-kidney and kidney transplantation alone on post-transplantation fracture risk are unknown. From the United States Renal Data System, we identified 11,145 adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing transplantation, of whom 4933 had a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant and 6212 had a kidney-alone transplant between 2000 and 2006. Post-transplantation fractures resulting in hospitalization were identified from discharge codes. Time to first fracture was modeled and propensity score adjustment was used to balance covariates between groups. Fractures occurred in significantly fewer (4.7%) of pancreas-kidney compared with kidney-alone transplant (5.9%) cohorts. After gender stratification and adjustment for fracture covariates, pancreas-kidney transplantation was associated with a significant 31% reduction in fracture risk in men (hazard risk 0.69). Older age, white race, prior dialysis, and pre-transplantation fracture were also associated with increased fracture risk.
