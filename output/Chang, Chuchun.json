[{"PMID": "36787333", "Title": "Visualizing increased uptake of [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA in kidneys from obese high-fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice using PET/CT ex vivo.", "Abstract": "It is known that high-fat diet (HFD) and/or diabetes may influence substrate preferences and energy demands in the heart preceding diabetic cardiomyopathy. They may also induce structural glomerular changes causing diabetic nephropathy. PET/CT has been utilized to examine uptake of energy substrates, and to study metabolic changes or shifts before onset of metabolic disorders. However, conventional PET/CT scanning of organs with relatively low uptake, such as the kidney, in small animals in vivo may render technical difficulties. To address this issue, we developed a PET/CT ex vivo protocol with radiolabeled glucose and fatty acid analouges, [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA,to study substrate uptake in mouse kidneys. We also aimed to detect a possible energy substrate shift before onset of diabetic nephropathy. The ex vivo protocol reduced interfering background as well as interindividual variances. We found increased uptake of [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA in kidneys after HFD, compared to kidneys from young mice on standard chow. Levels of kidney triglycerides also increased on HFD. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, the enzyme responsible for release of fatty acids from circulating lipoproteins, is normally increased in postprandial mice kidneys. After long-term HFD, we found that LPL activity was suppressed, and could therefore not explain the increased levels of stored triglycerides. Suppressed LPL activity was associated with increased expression of angiopoietin-like protein4, an inhibitor of LPL. HFD did not alter the transcriptional control of some common glucose and fatty acid transporters that may mediate uptake of [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA. Performing PET/CT ex vivo reduced interfering background and interindividual variances. Obesity and insulin resistance induced by HFD increased the uptake of [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA and triglyceride accumulation in mouse kidneys. Increased levels of [18F]FDG and [18F]FTHA in obese insulin resistant mice could be used clinically as an indicator of poor metabolic control, and a complementary test for incipient diabetic nephropathy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Acids", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Glucose", "Kidney", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Obesity", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rakel", "Last Name": "Nyr\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biosciences/Physiological Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Henrik", "Last Name": "Scherman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Sciences, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Axelsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Sciences, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Chuchun L", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gunilla", "Last Name": "Olivecrona", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biosciences/Physiological Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Madelene", "Last Name": "Ericsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biosciences/Physiological Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "36396956", "Title": "Dietary long-chain omega 3 fatty acids modify sphingolipid metabolism to facilitate airway hyperreactivity.", "Abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are essential nutrients that can affect inflammatory responses. While n-3 PUFAs are generally considered beneficial for cardiovascular disease and obesity, the effects on asthma, the most common inflammatory lung disease are unclear. While prenatal dietary n-3 PUFAs decrease the risk for childhood wheezing, postnatal dietary n-3 PUFAs can worsen allergic airway inflammation. Sphingolipid metabolism is also affected by dietary n-3 PUFAs. Decreased sphingolipid synthesis leads to airway hyperreactivity, besides inflammation, a cardinal feature of asthma, and common genetic asthma risk alleles lead to lower sphingolipid synthesis. We investigated the effect of dietary n-3 PUFAs on sphingolipid metabolism and airway reactivity. Comparing a fish-oil diet with a high n-3 PUFA content (FO) to an isocaloric coconut oil-enriched diet (CO), we found an n-3 PUFA-dependent effect on increased airway reactivity, that was not accompanied by inflammation. Lung and whole blood content of dihydroceramides, ceramides, sphingomyelins, and glucosylceramides were lower in mice fed the n-3 PUFA enriched diet consistent with lower sphingolipid synthesis. In contrast, phosphorylated long chain bases such as sphingosine 1-phosphate were increased. These findings suggest that dietary n-3 PUFAs affect pulmonary sphingolipid composition to favor innate airway hyperreactivity, independent of inflammation, and point to an important role of n-3 PUFAs in sphingolipid metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Female", "Animals", "Mice", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Fatty Acids", "Diet", "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated", "Asthma", "Inflammation", "Sphingolipids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Heras", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rika", "Last Name": "Gomi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Madeline", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chuchun L", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition/Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Wasserman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anurag", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenzhu", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinghua", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, Drukier Institute for Children's Health, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uthra", "Last Name": "Balaji", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, Drukier Institute for Children's Health, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Perdita", "Last Name": "Permaul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ibrahim", "Last Name": "Janahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Sidra Hospital, Doha, Qatar."}, {"First Name": "Tilla S", "Last Name": "Worgall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Worgall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, 413 East 69th Street, Room 1200, New York, NY, 10021, USA. stw2006@med.cornell.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Nov17"}, {"PMID": "32966188", "Title": "Novel Approaches for Omega-3 Fatty Acid Therapeutics: Chronic Versus Acute Administration to Protect Heart, Brain, and Spinal Cord.", "Abstract": "This article reviews novel approaches for omega-3 fatty acid (FA) therapeutics and the linked molecular mechanisms in cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

Since cholesteryl ethers do not leave cells after uptake and are not hydrolyzed by mammalian cellular enzymes, these compounds can act as markers for cumulative cell uptakes of labeled particles. We have employed [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether to study the uptake and distribution of triglyceride-rich emulsion particles on animal models. However, questionable unexpected results compelled us to analyze the stability of these ethers. We tested the stability of two commercially available radiolabeled cholesteryl ethers - [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether and [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether from different suppliers, employing in vitro, in vivo and chemical model systems. Our results show that, among the two cholesteryl ethers tested, one ether was hydrolyzed to free cholesterol in vitro, in vivo and chemically under alkaline hydrolyzing agent. Free cholesterol, unlike cholesteryl ether, can then re-enter the circulation leading to confounding results. The other ether was not hydrolyzed to free cholesterol and remained as a stable ether. Hence, radiolabeled cholesteryl ethers should be analyzed for biological stability before utilizing them for in vitro or in vivo experiments.", "Keywords": ["CE, cholesteryl ester", "Cholesteryl ether", "FC, free cholesterol", "J774 A2 macrophages", "Soy oil emulsion", "TG, triglycerides", "TLC, thin layer chromatography", "Thin layer chromatography", "[3H]CEt-ARC, [3H] cholesteryl oleoyl ether-American Radiolabeled Chemicals", "[3H]CEt-PE, [3H] cholesteryl hexadecyl ether-PerkinElmer", "hrs, hours", "triDHA emulsion"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Denny Joseph", "Last Name": "Manual Kollareth", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chuchun L", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Inge H", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry and biophysics reports", "PubDate": "2018Mar"}, {"PMID": "24747115", "Title": "Incremental replacement of saturated fats by n-3 fatty acids in high-fat, high-cholesterol diets reduces elevated plasma lipid levels and arterial lipoprotein lipase, macrophages and atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice.", "Abstract": "Effects of progressive substitution of dietary n-3 fatty acids (FA) for saturated FA (SAT) on modulating risk factors for atherosclerosis have not been fully defined.

To determine how LpL affects the biology of adipose tissue, we created adipose-specific LpL knock-out (ATLO) mice, and we compared them with whole body LpL knock-out mice rescued with muscle LpL expression (MCK/L0) and wild type (WT) mice. ATLO LpL mRNA and activity were reduced, respectively, 75 and 70% in gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), 90 and 80% in subcutaneous tissue, and 84 and 85% in brown adipose tissue (BAT). ATLO mice had increased plasma TG levels associated with reduced chylomicron TG uptake into BAT and lung. ATLO BAT, but not GAT, had altered TG composition. GAT from MCK/L0 was smaller and contained less polyunsaturated fatty acids in TG, although GAT from ATLO was normal unless LpL was overexpressed in muscle. High fat diet feeding led to less adipose in MCK/L0 mice but TG acyl composition in subcutaneous tissue and BAT reverted to that of WT. Therefore, adipocyte LpL in BAT modulates plasma lipoprotein clearance, and the greater metabolic activity of this depot makes its lipid composition more dependent on LpL-mediated uptake. Loss of adipose LpL reduces fat accumulation only if accompanied by greater LpL activity in muscle. These data support the role of LpL as the \"gatekeeper\" for tissue lipid distribution.", "Keywords": ["Adipocyte", "Fatty Acid", "Hypertriglyceridemia", "Lipids", "Macrophages", "Obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipocytes", "Adipose Tissue", "Adipose Tissue, Brown", "Adipose Tissue, White", "Animals", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Chylomicrons", "Lipids", "Lipolysis", "Lipoprotein Lipase", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Phenotype", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Itsaso", "Last Name": "Garcia-Arcos", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yaeko", "Last Name": "Hiyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Konstantinos", "Last Name": "Drosatos", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kalyani G", "Last Name": "Bharadwaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yunying", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ni Huiping", "Last Name": "Son", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sheila M", "Last Name": "O'Byrne", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Chuchun L", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Manabu", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Jichii University, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032; Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Amsterdam, 1105AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Joseph C", "Last Name": "Obunike", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, New York City College of Technology, City University of New York, Brooklyn, New York 11201."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hiroaki", "Last Name": "Yagyu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Jichii University, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan."}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ira J", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.
