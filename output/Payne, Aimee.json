In this real-world observational study of 463 autoimmune subjects, we examined risk factors for poor B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We show a high frequency of inadequate anti-spike IgG responses to vaccination and boosting in the autoimmune population but minimal suppression of T cell responses. Low IgG responses in B cell-depleted multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects were associated with higher CD8 T cell responses. By contrast, subjects taking mycophenolate mofetil exhibited concordant suppression of B and T cell responses. Treatments with highest risk for low IgG anti-spike response included B cell depletion within the last year, fingolimod, and combination treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and belimumab. Our data show that the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, is the most effective vaccine in the autoimmune population. There was minimal induction of either disease flares or autoantibodies by vaccination and no significant effect of pre-existing anti-type I interferon antibodies on either vaccine response or breakthrough infections. The low frequency of breakthrough infections and lack of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths suggest that T cell immunity contributes to protection in autoimmune disease.", "Keywords": ["Autoimmune diseases",

The pathogenic roles for B cells include direct functions such as production of autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines and indirect functions via antigen presentation to T cells. The efficacy of B cell-depleting strategies varies across diseases and likely reflects the complexity of disease pathogenesis and relative contribution of B cell roles. Additionally, B cell-depleting therapies do not equally target all B cell subsets in all patients, and this likely explains some of the variability in responses. Recent reports of B cell depletion with novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell approaches in an expanding number of autoimmune diseases highlight the potential role of B cell depletion in resetting immune tolerance.

However, the spatial organization and viability of its bacterial components remain unclear. Here, we apply culturing, imaging, and molecular approaches to human and mouse skin samples, and find that the skin surface is colonized by fewer viable bacteria than predicted by bacterial DNA levels. Instead, viable skin-associated bacteria are predominantly located in hair follicles and other cutaneous invaginations. Furthermore, we show that the skin microbiome has a uniquely low fraction of viable bacteria compared to other human microbiome sites, indicating that most bacterial DNA on the skin surface is not associated with viable cells Additionally, a small number of bacterial families dominate each skin site and traditional sequencing methods overestimate both the richness and diversity of the skin microbiome. Finally, we performed an in vivo skin microbiome perturbation-recovery study using human volunteers. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that, while the skin microbiome is remarkably stable even in the wake of aggressive perturbation, repopulation of the skin surface is driven by the underlying viable population. Our findings help explain the dynamics of skin microbiome perturbation as bacterial DNA on the skin surface can be transiently perturbed but is replenished by a stable underlying viable population.

However, it is unclear whether multi-pathogenicity is mediated by individual or multiple autoantibody clones. Using an unbiased B cell culture screening approach, we generated a library of 11 human-derived AChR-specific recombinant monoclonal autoantibodies (mAb) and assessed their binding properties and pathogenic profiles using specialized cell-based assays. Five mAbs activated complement, three blocked \u03b1-bungarotoxin binding to the receptor, and seven induced antigenic modulation. Furthermore, two clonally related mAbs derived from one patient were each highly efficient at more than one of these mechanisms, demonstrating that pathogenic mechanisms are not mutually exclusive at the monoclonal level. Using novel Jurkat cell lines that individually express each monomeric AChR subunit (\u03b12\u03b2\u03b4\u03b5), these two mAbs with multi-pathogenic capacity were determined to exclusively bind the \u03b1-subunit of AChR, demonstrating an association between mAb specificity and pathogenic capacity. These findings provide new insight into the immunopathology of MG, demonstrating that single autoreactive clones can efficiently mediate multiple modes of pathology.

A small subset of patients (<10%) with MG, have autoantibodies targeting muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). MuSK MG patients respond well to CD20-mediated B cell depletion therapy (BCDT); most achieve complete stable remission. However, relapse often occurs. To further understand the immunomechanisms underlying relapse, we studied autoantibody-producing B cells over the course of BCDT. We developed a fluorescently labeled antigen to enrich for MuSK-specific B cells, which was validated with a novel Nalm6 cell line engineered to express a human MuSK-specific B cell receptor. B cells (\u2245 2.6 million) from 12 different samples collected from nine MuSK MG patients were screened for MuSK specificity. We successfully isolated two MuSK-specific IgG4 subclass-expressing plasmablasts from two of these patients, who were experiencing a relapse after a BCDT-induced remission. Human recombinant MuSK mAbs were then generated to validate binding specificity and characterize their molecular properties. Both mAbs were strong MuSK binders, they recognized the Ig1-like domain of MuSK, and showed pathogenic capacity when tested in an acetylcholine receptor\u00a0(AChR) clustering assay. The presence of persistent clonal relatives of these MuSK-specific B cell clones was investigated through B cell receptor repertoire tracing of 63,977 unique clones derived from longitudinal samples collected from these two patients. Clonal variants were detected at multiple timepoints spanning more than five years and reemerged after BCDT-mediated remission, predating disease relapse by several months. These findings demonstrate that a reservoir of rare pathogenic MuSK autoantibody-expressing B cell clones survive BCDT and reemerge into circulation prior to manifestation of clinical relapse. Overall, this study provides both a mechanistic understanding of MuSK MG relapse and a valuable candidate biomarker for relapse prediction.", "Keywords": ["Autoantibodies", "B cell depletion therapy", "B cells", "Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK)", "Myasthenia gravis", "Rituximab"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Myasthenia Gravis", "Autoantibodies", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Clone Cells", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miriam L", "Last Name": "Fichtner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 George Street - Room 353J, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth B", "Last Name": "Hoehn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Easton E", "Last Name": "Ford", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Mane-Damas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Sangwook", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Waters", "Affiliation": "Oxford Autoimmune Neurology Group, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Aimee S", "Last Name": "Payne", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa L", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Corey T", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Losen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Pilar", "Last Name": "Martinez-Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Nowak", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 George Street - Room 353J, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven H", "Last Name": "Kleinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 George Street - Room 353J, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin C", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 George Street - Room 353J, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. kevin.oconnor@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2022Oct28"}, {"PMID": "34756581", "Title": "Pemphigus and Pemphigoid: From Disease Mechanisms to Druggable Pathways.", "Abstract": "Pemphigus and pemphigoid are paradigms for understanding the mechanisms of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease in humans.

While there are various QOL measurement tools that can be used in this disease, few studies have assessed how a patient's change in disease severity can affect their QOL. This study aims to identify which disease severity index correlates best with the change in QOL. Fifty pemphigus patients completed QOL surveys with disease severity scored over two visits. QOL was assessed with the Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life (ABQOL), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Skindex-29, and Short Form Survey 36 (SF-36). Disease severity was scored with the Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) and Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS). Correlations between the change in QOL scores and change in disease severity were analyzed using Spearman's coefficient (r). The change in PDAI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.60-0.79) with changes in the ABQOL, Skindex-29 symptoms (Skindex-S), and Skindex-29 functioning (Skindex-F) subscales for all patients (n = 50). For patients with mucosal disease (n = 24), the change in PDAI showed a strong correlation with changes in the ABQOL and Skindex-S subscale. For patients without mucosal disease, the change in PDAI showed a strong correlation with the Skindex-S. The change in ABSIS showed a strong correlation with Skindex-S for all patients and patients with no mucosal involvement, but showed no strong correlations for patients with mucosal involvement. The changes in PDAI always had a stronger correlation than the changes in ABSIS scores to changes in the ABQOL, DLQI, and Skindex-29 subscales, except where the PDAI and ABSIS scores were about the same for the Skindex-S subscale in patients with no mucosal involvement (r = 0.76 and r = 0.77, respectively). PDAI is superior to ABSIS in its correlation with validated QOL tools.

"Objective: Current evidence has revealed a significant association between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and neurological diseases (ND), including stroke, but the incidence of BP autoantibodies in patients with stroke has not previously been investigated. Our study aimed to assess BP antigen-specific antibodies in stroke patients. Design: One hundred patients with stroke and 100 matched healthy controls were randomly selected for measurement of anti-BP180/BP230 IgG autoantibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), salt-split indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and immunoblotting against human cutaneous BP180 and BP180-NC16A. Results: Anti-BP180 autoantibodies were found in 14 (14.0%) patients with stroke and 5 (5.0%) of controls by ELISA (p < 0.05). Sera from 13 (13.0%) patients with stroke and 3 (3.0%) controls reacted with 180-kDa proteins from human epidermal extract (p < 0.05). 11 (11.0%) of stroke and 2 (2.0%) of control sera recognized the human recombinant full length BP180 and NC16A (p < 0.05). The anti-BP180-positive patients were significantly younger than the negative patients at the time of stroke (p < 0.001).

Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1-like (RPGRIP1L) is a ciliary protein required for ciliogenesis in many cell types, including epidermal keratinocytes. Here we report that RPGRIP1L is also involved in the maintenance of desmosomal junctions between keratinocytes. Genetically disrupting the Rpgrip1l gene in mice caused intraepidermal blistering, primarily between basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. This blistering phenotype was associated with aberrant expression patterns of desmosomal proteins, impaired desmosome ultrastructure, and compromised cell-cell adhesion in vivo and in vitro. We found that disrupting the RPGRIP1L gene in HaCaT cells, which do not form primary cilia, resulted in mislocalization of desmosomal proteins to the cytoplasm, suggesting a cilia-independent function of RPGRIP1L. Mechanistically, we found that RPGRIP1L regulates the endocytosis of desmogleins such that RPGRIP1L-knockdown not only induced spontaneous desmoglein endocytosis, as determined by AK23 labeling and biotinylation assays, but also exacerbated EGTA- or pemphigus vulgaris IgG-induced desmoglein endocytosis. Accordingly, inhibiting endocytosis with dynasore or sucrose rescued these desmosomal phenotypes. Biotinylation assays on cell surface proteins not only reinforced the role of RPGRIP1L in desmoglein endocytosis, but also suggested that RPGRIP1L may be more broadly involved in endocytosis. Thus, data obtained from this study advanced our understanding of the biological functions of RPGRIP1L by identifying its role in the cellular endocytic pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Line", "Desmogleins", "Desmosomes", "Endocytosis", "Epidermis", "Humans", "Intercellular Junctions", "Keratinocytes", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yeon Ja", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Laclef", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS UMR7622, Inserm U1156, IBPS-Laboratoire de Biologie du D\u00e9veloppement, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Abraham", "Last Name": "Andreu-Cervera", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS UMR7622, Inserm U1156, IBPS-Laboratoire de Biologie du D\u00e9veloppement, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xuming", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth R", "Last Name": "Snedecor", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ken-Ichi", "Last Name": "Takemaru", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chuan", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Science;

In the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and DSG1 autoantibodies are predominantly of the IgG4 subclass and less frequently of IgG1 and IgA subclasses, prompting us to investigate whether anti-DSG IgG4 B cells share lineages with IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2. Combining subclass-specific B cell deep sequencing with high-throughput antibody screening, we identified 80 DSG-reactive lineages from 4 PV patients. Most anti-DSG IgG4 B cells lacked clonal relationships to other subclasses and preferentially targeted DSG adhesion domains, whereas anti-DSG IgA frequently evolved from or to other subclasses and recognized a broader range of epitopes. Our findings suggest that anti-DSG IgG4 B cells predominantly evolve independently or diverge early from other subclasses and that IgA is most often not the origin of IgG autoreactivity in PV.

Starting with a CD4-based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that was previously used without toxicity in clinical trials, we optimized the vector backbone, promoter, HIV targeting moiety, and transmembrane and signaling domains to determine which components augmented the ability of T cells to control HIV replication. This re-engineered CAR was at least 50-fold more potent in vitro at controlling HIV replication than the original CD4 CAR, or a TCR-based approach, and substantially better than broadly neutralizing antibody-based CARs. A humanized mouse model of HIV infection demonstrated that T cells expressing optimized CARs were superior at expanding in response to antigen, protecting CD4 T cells from infection, and reducing viral loads compared to T cells expressing the original, clinical trial CAR. Moreover, in a humanized mouse model of HIV treatment, CD4 CAR T cells containing the 4-1BB costimulatory domain controlled HIV spread after ART removal better than analogous CAR T cells containing the CD28 costimulatory domain. Together, these data indicate that potent HIV-specific T cells can be generated using improved CAR design and that CAR T cells could be important components of an HIV cure strategy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Recoverin", "Signal Transduction", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel S", "Last Name": "Leibman", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Max W", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christoph T", "Last Name": "Ellebrecht", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Colby R", "Last Name": "Maldini", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Glover", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Center for AIDS Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Secreto", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Center for AIDS Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Kulikovskaya", "Affiliation": "Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Simon F", "Last Name": "Lacey", "Affiliation": "Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarah R", "Last Name": "Akkina", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yanjie", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Center for AIDS Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Farida", "Last Name": "Shaheen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Center for AIDS Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jianbin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Sangamo BioSciences Inc., Richmond, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Keith A", "Last Name": "Dufendach", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "Sangamo BioSciences Inc., Richmond, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Collman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Center for AIDS Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Aimee S", "Last Name": "Payne", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "James L", "Last Name": "Riley", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28697782", "Title": "Exploring intentions of physician-scientist trainees: factors influencing MD and MD/PhD interest in research careers.", "Abstract": "Prior studies have described the career paths of physician-scientist candidates after graduation, but the factors that influence career choices at the candidate stage remain unclear.

Glucocorticoids improve disease within days by increasing DSG3 gene transcription, although the mechanism for this observation remains unknown. Here, we show that DSG3 transcription in keratinocytes is regulated by Stat3. Treatment of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) with hydrocortisone or rapamycin, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, significantly increases DSG3 mRNA and protein expression and correspondingly reduces phospho-S727 Stat3. Stat3 inhibition or shRNA-knockdown also significantly increases DSG3 mRNA and protein levels. Hydrocortisone- or rapamycin-treated PHKs demonstrate increased number and length of desmosomes by electron microscopy and are resistant to PV IgG-induced loss of cell adhesion, whereas constitutive activation of Stat3 in PHKs abrogates DSG3 upregulation and inhibits hydrocortisone and rapamycin's therapeutic effects. Topical hydrocortisone, rapamycin, or Stat3 inhibitor XVIII prevents autoantibody-induced blistering in the PV passive transfer mouse model, correlating with increased epidermal DSG3 expression and decreased phospho-S727 Stat3. Our data indicate that glucocorticoids and rapamycin upregulate DSG3 transcription through inhibition of Stat3.

The Pathogenesis of Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Meeting, organized by the Departments of Dermatology in L\u00fcbeck and Marburg and the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Munich, was held in September 2016 in Munich. The meeting brought together basic scientists and clinicians from all continents dedicating their work to autoimmune blistering diseases. Considerable advances have been made in describing incidences and prevalences of these diseases and linking comorbidities with autoantibody reactivities and clinical variants, for example, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor-associated noninflammatory bullous pemphigoid. Although new entities are still being described, diagnosis of most autoimmune blistering diseases can now be achieved using standardized and widely available serological test systems. Various experimental mouse models of pemphigus and pemphigoid disease are increasingly being used to understand mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance and to evaluate more specific treatment approaches for these disorders, such as molecules that target autoreactive T and B cells and anti-inflammatory mediators, that is, dimethyl fumarate, phosphodiesterase 4, and leukotriene B4 inhibitors in pemphigoid disorders, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells in pemphigus. Very recent experimental data about the immunopathology and the determinants of autoantibody formation and keratinocyte susceptibility in pemphigus were discussed. With regard to cellular mechanisms leading to the loss of cell-cell adhesion, new ideas were shared in the field of signal transduction. Major steps were taken to put the various partly contradictory and controversial findings about the effects of pemphigus autoantibodies and other inflammatory mediators into perspective and broaden our view of the complex pathophysiology of this disease.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that amino acid residues predisposing VH1-46 Abs to Dsg3 reactivity reside in CDR2. However, somatic mutations only rarely promote Dsg3-VP6 cross-reactivity; most mutations abolish VP6 and/or Dsg3 reactivity. Nevertheless, functional testing identified two cross-reactive VH1-46 Abs that both disrupt keratinocyte adhesion and inhibit rotavirus replication, indicating the potential for VH1-46 Abs to have both pathologic autoimmune and protective immune functions. Taken together, these studies suggest that certain VH1-46 B cell populations may be predisposed to Dsg3-VP6 cross-reactivity, but multiple mechanisms prevent the onset of autoimmunity after rotavirus exposure.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antigens, Viral", "Autoantigens", "Capsid Proteins", "Cross Reactions", "Desmoglein 3", "Dual-Specificity Phosphatases", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Pemphigus", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Rotavirus Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104;"}, {"First Name": "Christoph T", "Last Name": "Ellebrecht", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104;"}, {"First Name": "Christoph M", "Last Name": "Hammers", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, 23538 L\u00fcbeck, Germany;"}, {"First Name": "Eric M", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104;"}, {"First Name": "Gopal", "Last Name": "Sapparapu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; and."}, {"First Name": "Crystal E", "Last Name": "Boudreaux", "Affiliation": "Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, Roanoke, VA 24016."}, {"First Name": "Sarah M", "Last Name": "McDonald", "Affiliation": "Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, Roanoke, VA 24016."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Crowe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; and."}, {"First Name": "Aimee S", "Last Name": "Payne", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; aimee.payne@uphs.upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2016Aug15"}, {"PMID": "27365313", "Title": "Reengineering chimeric antigen receptor T cells for targeted therapy of autoimmune disease.", "Abstract": "Ideally, therapy for autoimmune diseases should eliminate pathogenic autoimmune cells while sparing protective immunity, but feasible strategies for such an approach have been elusive.

F706 anti-Dsg3 IgG4 and F779 anti-Dsg3 IgG1, previously isolated as heterohybridomas, and Px43, a monovalent anti-Dsg3/Dsg1 IgG antibody isolated by phage display, were subcloned to obtain paired sets of IgG1 and IgG4 mAbs. Using ELISA and cell surface staining assays, F706 and F779 demonstrated similar antigen binding affinities of IgG1 and IgG4, whereas Px43 showed 3- to 8-fold higher affinity of IgG4 versus IgG1 by ELISA, but identical binding affinities to human skin, perhaps due to targeting of a quaternary epitope best displayed in tissues.

Serum veltuzumab levels were 22 and 29 \u03bcg/mL 2 weeks after the first dose of each cycle, and the drug remained detectable in the serum for longer than 3 months. Relapse and response to veltuzumab generally correlated with desmoglein 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay index values. Shortly after a relapse that occurred after a long-term remission, the patient demonstrated an elevated naive (CD19+CD27\u2212) to memory (CD19+CD27+) B-cell ratio of 19.5 and transitional (CD19+CD24+CD38+) B-cell frequency of 12.5%.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Subcutaneous veltuzumab may be a safe, effective, and more economical alternative to intravenous rituximab for PV therapy.

Here, we clone anti-Dsg3 antibodies (Abs) from four PV patients and identify pathogenic VH1-46 autoAbs from all four patients. Unexpectedly, VH1-46 autoAbs had relatively few replacement mutations. We reverted antibody somatic mutations to their germline sequences to determine the requirement of mutations for autoreactivity. Three of five VH1-46 germline-reverted Abs maintain Dsg3 binding, compared with zero of five non-VH1-46 germline-reverted Abs. Site-directed mutagenesis of VH1-46 Abs demonstrates that acidic amino-acid residues introduced by somatic mutation or heavy chain VDJ recombination are necessary and sufficient for Dsg3 binding. Our data suggest that VH1-46 autoantibody gene usage is commonly found in PV because VH1-46 Abs require few to no mutations to acquire Dsg3 autoreactivity, which may favour their early selection.

Previous studies suggest that PV pathogenesis involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent and -independent pathways. However, p38 is a difficult protein to study and therapeutically target because it has four isoforms and multiple downstream effectors. In this study, we identify MAPKAP (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein) kinase 2 (MK2) as a downstream effector of p38 signaling in PV and describe MK2-dependent and -independent mechanisms of blister formation using passive transfer of human anti-Dsg IgG4 mAbs to neonatal mice. In human keratinocytes, PV mAbs activate MK2 in a dose-dependent manner. MK2 is also activated in human pemphigus skin blisters, causing translocation of MK2 from the nucleus to the cytosol. Small-molecule inhibition of MK2 and silencing of MK2 expression block PV mAb-induced Dsg3 endocytosis in human keratinocytes. In addition, small-molecule inhibition and genetic deletion of p38\u03b1 and MK2 inhibit spontaneous but not induced suprabasal blisters by PV mAbs in mouse passive transfer models. Collectively, these data suggest that MK2 is a key downstream effector of p38 that can modulate PV autoantibody pathogenicity.

In all three cases, oral prednisone used in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) resulted in complete clinical remission, during which all pharmacotherapy was successfully discontinued. Resolution of the skin and mucosal blistering tended to occur quickly with prednisone, and after initiation of treatment with MMF, discontinuation of all pharmacotherapy was achieved within a range of 10 to 30\u2003months in the three patients. One patient experienced a recurrence of genital lesions 19\u2003months after discontinuation of therapy, but the condition remitted within 2\u2003weeks with topical corticosteroid therapy.
