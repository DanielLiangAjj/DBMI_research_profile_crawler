[{"PMID": "38755281", "Title": "Optical genome mapping unveils hidden structural variants in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Abstract": "While short-read sequencing currently dominates genetic research and diagnostics, it frequently falls short of capturing certain structural variants (SVs), which are often implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Optical genome mapping (OGM) is an innovative technique capable of capturing SVs that are undetectable or challenging-to-detect via short-read methods. This study aimed to investigate NDDs using OGM, specifically focusing on cases that remained unsolved after standard exome sequencing. OGM was performed in 47 families using ultra-high molecular weight DNA. Single-molecule maps were assembled de novo, followed by SV and copy number variant calling. We identified 7 variants of interest, of which 5 (10.6%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, located in BCL11A, OPHN1, PHF8, SON, and NFIA. We also identified an inversion disrupting NAALADL2, a gene which previously was found to harbor complex rearrangements in two NDD cases. Variants in known NDD genes or candidate variants of interest missed by exome sequencing mainly consisted of larger insertions (>\u20091kbp), inversions, and deletions/duplications of a low number of exons (1-4 exons). In conclusion, in addition to improving molecular diagnosis in NDDs, this technique may also reveal novel NDD genes which may harbor complex SVs often missed by standard sequencing techniques.", "Keywords": ["Copy number variants", "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "Optical genome mapping", "Structural variants", "Unsolved cases"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Female", "Male", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Chromosome Mapping", "Exome Sequencing", "Child", "Genomic Structural Variation", "Child, Preschool"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Statistical Genetics, Gertrude H.

The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants on chromosome X associated with ARHL through the analysis of data obtained from the UK Biobank. We performed association analysis between self-reported measures of HL and genotyped and imputed variants on chromosome X from \u223c460,000 white Europeans. We identified three loci associated with ARHL with a genome-wide significance level (p < 5 \u00d7 10-8), ZNF185 (rs186256023, p = 4.9 \u00d7 10-10) and MAP7D2 (rs4370706, p = 2.3 \u00d7 10-8) in combined analysis of males and females, and LOC101928437 (rs138497700, p = 8.9 \u00d7 10-9) in the sex-stratified analysis of males. In-silico mRNA expression analysis showed MAP7D2 and ZNF185 are expressed in mice and adult human inner ear tissues, particularly in the inner hair cells. We estimated that only a small amount of variation of ARHL, 0.4%, is explained by variants on the X chromosome.

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 15 novel risk loci and replicated the regions of three previously reported candidate genes. In this study, seven candidate genes from the GWAS were resequenced using single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs). smMIPs were used to capture the exonic regions and the 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTR). Discovered variants were tested for association with the disease using single variant and gene-based association analysis. The single variant results showed that 13 significant variants were associated with otosclerosis. Associated variants were found in five of the seven genes studied here, including AHSG, LINC01482, MARK3, SUPT3H and RELN. Conversely, burden testing did not show a major role of rare variants in the disease. In conclusion, this study was able to replicate five out of seven candidate genes reported in the previous GWAS.

These episodes include frequent falls due to imbalance, dilated pupils, vertigo, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus. Brain imaging was normal. A prolonged electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed interictal epileptiform discharges but failed to capture her clinical events. For several years, she was treated for presumed focal seizures with preserved awareness and trialed on adequate dosing of several antiepileptic medications without improvement. After 25\u00a0years, given the more prolonged nature of her episodes and the mild interictal cerebellar signs, empiric treatment with acetazolamide was initiated for a presumed diagnosis of EA. Acetazolamide treatment led to a dramatic reduction in event frequency and severity. The initial EA genetic panel was negative. Clinical exome sequence analysis revealed a novel pathogenic de novo missense variant in the HECW2 gene [c.3829\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009C;(p.Tyr1277His)], located in the HECT domain.

Although atypical Gaucher disease due to deficiency of saposin C is rare, it exhibits vast phenotypic heterogeneity.

We discuss extended analysis methods to consider, non-Mendelian inheritance models, mosaicism, dual/multiple diagnoses, periodic re-analysis, artificial intelligence tools, and deep phenotyping, in addition to integrating various omics methods to improve variant prioritization. Last, novel genomic technologies, including long-read sequencing, artificial long-read sequencing, and optical genome mapping are discussed. In conclusion, a more comprehensive molecular analysis and a timely re-analysis of unsolved cases are imperative to improve diagnostic rates. In addition, our current understanding of the human genome is still limited due to restrictions in technologies. Novel technologies are now available that improve upon some of these limitations and can capture all human genomic variation more accurately.

We ascertained 56 small families mainly of Yoruba ethno-lingual ancestry in or near Ibadan, Nigeria, that had at least one individual with nonsyndromic, severe-to-profound, prelingual-onset, bilateral hearing loss not attributed to nongenetic factors. We performed a combination of exome and Sanger sequencing analyses to evaluate both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. No biallelic pathogenic variants were identified in GJB2, a common cause of deafness in many populations. Potential causative variants were identified in genes associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (CIB2, COL11A1, ILDR1, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, and WFS1), nonsyndromic hearing loss or Usher syndrome (CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, and USH2A), and other syndromic forms of hearing loss (CHD7, OPA1, and SPTLC1). Several rare mitochondrial variants, including m.1555A>G, were detected in the gene MT-RNR1 but not in control Yoruba samples. Overall, 20 (33%) of 60 independent cases of hearing loss in this cohort of families were associated with likely causal variants in genes reported to underlie deafness in other populations. None of these likely causal variants were present in more than one family, most were detected as compound heterozygotes, and 77% had not been previously associated with hearing loss. These results indicate an unusually high level of genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss in Ibadan, Nigeria and point to challenges for molecular genetic screening, counseling, and early intervention in this population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Genetic Loci", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Indigenous Peoples", "Male", "Nigeria"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adebolajo", "Last Name": "Adeyemo", "Affiliation": "Institute of Child Health, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. aadeyemo@com.ui.edu.ng."}, {"First Name": "Rabia", "Last Name": "Faridi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Parna", "Last Name": "Chattaraj", "Affiliation": "Otolaryngology Branch, NIDCD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rizwan", "Last Name": "Yousaf", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Risa", "Last Name": "Tona", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Okorie", "Affiliation": "Institute of Child Health, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}, {"First Name": "Thashi", "Last Name": "Bharadwaj", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Gertrude H.

DNA samples from a South African family presenting with progressive, autosomal dominant non-syndromic HI were subjected to whole-exome sequencing, and a novel monoallelic variant in REST [c.1244GC; p.(C415S)], was identified as the putative causative variant. The co-segregation of the variant was confirmed with Sanger Sequencing. The variant is absent from databases, 103 healthy South African controls, and 52 South African probands with isolated HI. In silico analysis indicates that the p.C415S variant in REST substitutes a conserved cysteine and results in changes to the surrounding secondary structure and the disulphide bonds, culminating in alteration of the tertiary structure of REST. Localization studies using ectopically expressed GFP-tagged Wild type (WT) and mutant REST in HEK-293 cells show that WT REST localizes exclusively to the nucleus; however, the mutant protein localizes throughout the cell. Additionally, mutant REST has an impaired ability to repress its known target AF1q. The data demonstrates that the identified mutation compromises the function of REST and support its implication in HI.

OGDHL expression is restricted mainly to the brain in humans. Here, we report nine individuals from eight unrelated families carrying bi-allelic variants in OGDHL with a range of neurological and neurodevelopmental phenotypes including epilepsy, hearing loss, visual impairment, gait ataxia, microcephaly, and hypoplastic corpus callosum. The variants include three homozygous missense variants (p.Pro852Ala, p.Arg244Trp, and p.Arg299Gly), three compound heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (p.Arg673Gln/p.Val488Val, p.Phe734Ser/p.Ala327Val, and p.Trp220Cys/p.Asp491Val), one homozygous frameshift variant (p.Cys553Leufs\u221716), and one homozygous stop-gain variant (p.Arg440Ter). To support the pathogenicity of the variants, we developed a novel CRISPR-Cas9-mediated tissue-specific knockout with cDNA rescue system for dOgdh, the Drosophila ortholog of human OGDHL. Pan-neuronal knockout of dOgdh led to developmental lethality as well as defects in Krebs cycle metabolism, which was fully rescued by expression of wild-type dOgdh. Studies using the Drosophila system indicate that p.Arg673Gln, p.Phe734Ser, and p.Arg299Gly are severe loss-of-function alleles, leading to developmental lethality, whereas p.Pro852Ala, p.Ala327Val, p.Trp220Cys, p.Asp491Val, and p.Arg244Trp are hypomorphic alleles, causing behavioral defects. Transcript analysis from fibroblasts obtained from the individual carrying the synonymous variant (c.1464T>C [p.Val488Val]) in family 2 showed that the synonymous variant affects splicing of exon 11 in OGDHL. Human neuronal cells with OGDHL knockout exhibited defects in mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essential role of OGDHL in mitochondrial metabolism in humans.

We sequenced the coding, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR regions of ACAN in 1497 unrelated otosclerosis cases and 1437 matched controls from six different subpopulations. The association between variants in ACAN and the disease risk was tested through single variant and gene-based association tests. After correction for multiple testing, 14 variants were significantly associated with otosclerosis, ten of which represented independent association signals. Eight variants showed a consistent association across all subpopulations. Allelic odds ratios of the variants identified four predisposing and ten protective variants. Gene-based tests showed an association of very rare variants in the 3'-UTR with the phenotype. The associated exonic variants are all located in the CS domain of ACAN and include both protective and predisposing variants with a broad spectrum of effect sizes and population frequencies. This includes variants with strong effect size and low frequency, typical for monogenic diseases, to low effect size variants with high frequency, characteristic for common complex traits. This single-gene allelic spectrum with both protective and predisposing alleles is unique in the field of complex diseases. In conclusion, these findings are a significant advancement to the understanding of the etiology of otosclerosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "5' Untranslated Regions", "Aggrecans", "Disease Susceptibility", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Otosclerosis", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Allan Thomas", "Last Name": "H\u00f8jland", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Lisse J M", "Last Name": "Tavernier", "Affiliation": "Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Neurology, Gertrude H.

Of genetic HI cases, 30% are syndromic and 70% are nonsyndromic. For nonsyndromic (NS) HI, 77% of the cases are due to autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance. ARNSHI is usually congenital/prelingual, severe-to-profound, affects all frequencies and is not progressive. Thus far, 73 ARNSHI genes have been identified. Populations with high rates of consanguinity have been crucial in the identification of ARNSHI genes, and 92% (67/73) of these genes were identified in consanguineous families. Recent changes in genomic technologies and analyses have allowed a shift towards ARNSHI gene discovery in outbred populations. The latter is crucial towards understanding the genetic architecture of ARNSHI in diverse and understudied populations.

Investigation of novel HI genes and variants will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and to aid genetic diagnosis. We performed exome sequencing and analysis using DNA samples from affected members of two large families from Ghana and Pakistan, segregating autosomal-dominant (AD) non-syndromic HI (NSHI). Using in silico approaches, we modeled and evaluated the effect of the likely pathogenic variants on protein structure and function. We identified two likely pathogenic variants in SLC12A2, c.2935G>A:p.(E979K) and c.2939A>T:p.(E980V), which segregate with NSHI in a Ghanaian and Pakistani family, respectively. SLC12A2 encodes an ion transporter crucial in the homeostasis of the inner ear endolymph and has recently been reported to be implicated in syndromic and non-syndromic HI. Both variants were mapped to alternatively spliced exon 21 of the SLC12A2 gene. Exon 21 encodes for 17 residues in the cytoplasmatic tail of SLC12A2, is highly conserved between species, and preferentially expressed in cochlear tissues. A review of previous studies and our current data showed that out of ten families with either AD non-syndromic or syndromic HI, eight (80%) had variants within the 17 amino acid residue region of exon 21 (48 bp), suggesting that this alternate domain is critical to the transporter activity in the inner ear. The genotypic spectrum of SLC12A2 was expanded and the involvement of SLC12A2 in ADNSHI was confirmed.

A total of 39 families with syndromic and non-syndromic ID were analyzed using exome sequencing, which revealed a variant in a known ID gene in 27 families. Notably, 75% of these variants in known ID genes were de novo or suspected de novo (64% autosomal dominant; 11% X-linked) and 25% were inherited (14% autosomal recessive; 7% X-linked; and 4% autosomal dominant). A dual molecular diagnosis was suggested in two families (5%). Via additional analysis and molecular testing, we identified three cases with an abnormal molecular karyotype, including chr21q22.12q22.2 uniparental disomy with a mosaic interstitial 2.7\u00a0Mb deletion covering DYRK1A and KCNJ6.

The variants identified, i.e., the missense [NM_016929.5:c.224T>C; p.(L75P)] and the splicing (NM_016929.5:c.63+1G>A), were validated using Sanger sequencing in all seven available family members and co-segregated with hearing impairment (HI) in the three hearing impaired family members.

Five dystrophin PEs with characteristics of poison exons were identified and categorized as the possible poison exon group. The comparative analysis of each essential splicing signal among different groups of dystrophin PEs and dystrophin CEs revealed that the possible poison exon group had a stronger 3' ss compared to any other group. As for auxiliary SREs, different groups of dystrophin PEs were found to have a smaller density of diverse types of exonic splicing enhancers and a higher density of several types of exonic splicing silencers compared to dystrophin CEs. In addition, the possible poison exon group had a smaller density of 3' ss intronic splicing silencers compared to dystrophin CEs.

By performing exome sequencing in two families with congenital nonsyndromic profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), we identified autosomal dominantly inherited missense variants [p.(Asn283Ser); p.(Thr116Ile)] in GREB1L, a neural crest regulatory molecule. The p.(Thr116Ile) variant was also associated with bilateral cochlear aplasia and cochlear nerve aplasia upon temporal bone imaging, an ultra-rare phenotype previously seen in patients with de novo GREB1L variants. An important role of GREB1L in normal ear development has also been demonstrated by greb1l-/- zebrafish, which show an abnormal sensory epithelia innervation. Last, we performed a review of all disease-associated variation described in GREB1L, as it has also been implicated in renal, bladder and genital malformations. We show that the spectrum of features associated with GREB1L is broad, variable and with a high level of reduced penetrance, which is typically characteristic of neurocristopathies. So far, seven GREB1L variants (14%) have been associated with ear-related abnormalities. In conclusion, these results show that autosomal dominantly inherited variants in GREB1L cause profound SNHL. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the phenotypic spectrum associated with GREB1L variants and strengthen the evidence of the involvement of GREB1L in human hearing.", "Keywords": ["GREB1L", "autosomal dominant inheritance", "cochlear aplasia", "cochlear nerve aplasia", "exome sequencing", "neural crest", "neurocristopathy", "profound nonsyndromic hearing impairment"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Child, Preschool", "Exome", "Female", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Humans", "Kidney", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation, Missense", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neural Crest", "Pedigree", "Exome Sequencing", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Khurram", "Last Name": "Liaqat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schatteman", "Affiliation": "Department of ENT, St-Augustinus Hospital Antwerp, 2610 Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Thashi", "Last Name": "Bharadwaj", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Nasir", "Affiliation": "Synthetic Protein Engineering Lab (SPEL), Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 443-749, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Anushree", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Van Camp", "Affiliation": "Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp & Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes", "PubDate": "2020Jun23"}, {"PMID": "32493431", "Title": "Transcriptional profiling of multiple system atrophy cerebellar tissue highlights differences between the parkinsonian and cerebellar sub-types of the disease.", "Abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare adult-onset neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, with no effective therapeutic options, and no cure. Limited work to date has attempted to characterize the transcriptional changes associated with the disease, which presents as either predominating parkinsonian (MSA-P) or cerebellar (MSC-C) symptoms. We report here the results of RNA expression profiling of cerebellar white matter (CWM) tissue from two independent cohorts of MSA patients (n\u2009=\u200966) and healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200966). RNA samples from bulk brain tissue and from oligodendrocytes obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) were sequenced. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and were examined before and after stratifying by MSA clinical sub-type.We detected the highest number of DEGs in the MSA-C group (n\u2009=\u2009747) while only one gene was noted in MSA-P, highlighting the larger dysregulation of the transcriptome in the MSA-C CWM. Results from both bulk tissue and LCM analysis showed a downregulation of oligodendrocyte genes and an enrichment for myelination processes with a key role noted for the QKI gene. Additionally, we observed a significant upregulation of neuron-specific gene expression in MSA-C and enrichment for synaptic processes. A third cluster of genes was associated with the upregulation of astrocyte and endothelial genes, two cell types with a key role in inflammation processes. Finally, network analysis in MSA-C showed enrichment for \u03b2-amyloid related functional classes, including the known Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes, APP and PSEN1.This is the largest RNA profiling study ever conducted on post-mortem brain tissue from MSA patients. We were able to define specific gene expression signatures for MSA-C highlighting the different stages of the complex neurodegenerative cascade of the disease that included alterations in several cell-specific transcriptional programs.

Somatic mosaic pathogenic variants associated with hemimegalencephaly, which is similar to MPPH, have also been observed. A Hungarian Roma family with two half-siblings, which present with intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, epilepsy, brain malformations, and megalencephaly was studied.

We identified a 12-year-old Caucasian/Hispanic male with the classical clinical characteristics of PMLD with lack of myelination of the subcortical white matter, and absence of the splenium of corpus callosum. Exome sequencing in the trio revealed novel compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in SNAP29 (p.Leu119AlafsX15, c.354DupG and p.0?, c.2T\u2009>\u2009C). Quantitative analysis of the patient's blood cells through RNA sequencing identified a significant decrease in SNAP29 mRNA expression, while western blot analysis on fibroblast cells revealed a lack of protein expression compared to parental and control cells. Mutations in SNAP29 have previously been associated with cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (CEDNIK) syndrome. Typical skin features described in CEDNIK syndrome, such as generalized ichthyosis and keratoderma, were absent in our patient. Moreover, the early onset nystagmus and leukodystrophy were consistent with a PMLD diagnosis.

For Europeans, Finns have the lowest prevalence due to ARNSHI PLP variants with 9.5 affected per 100,000 individuals. For East Asians, Latinos, non-Finish Europeans, and South Asians, ARNSHI prevalence due to PLP variants ranges from 17.1 to 33.7 affected per 100,000 individuals. ARNSHI variants that were previously reported in a single ancestry or family were observed in additional populations, e.g., USH1C p.(Q723*) reported in a Chinese family was the most prevalent pathogenic variant observed in gnomAD for African/African Americans.

Therefore, screening patients with congenital deafness for SAN dysfunction in this province could ensure adequate follow-up and prevent cardiac failure associated with SAN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Deafness", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pakistan", "Pedigree", "Prognosis", "Sinoatrial Node"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khurram", "Last Name": "Liaqat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed Irfan", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, HBS Medical College, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shabir", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Imen", "Last Name": "Chakchouk", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Nasir", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Anushree", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Izoduwa", "Last Name": "Abbe", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Umair", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Ansar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Irfan", "Last Name": "Ullah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Khadim", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Nickerson", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. sleal@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2019Feb"}, {"PMID": "30461122", "Title": "Mutational and phenotypic spectra of KCNE1 deficiency in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome and Romano-Ward Syndrome.", "Abstract": "KCNE1 encodes a regulatory subunit of the KCNQ1 potassium channel-complex. Both KCNE1 and KCNQ1 are necessary for normal hearing and cardiac ventricular repolarization. Recessive variants in these genes are associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (JLNS1 and JLNS2), a cardio-auditory syndrome characterized by congenital profound sensorineural deafness and a prolonged QT interval that can cause ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Some normal-hearing carriers of heterozygous missense variants of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 have prolonged QT intervals, a dominantly inherited phenotype designated Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), which is also associated with arrhythmias and elevated risk of sudden death. Coassembly of certain mutant KCNE1 monomers with wild-type KCNQ1 subunits results in RWS by a dominant negative mechanism. This paper reviews variants of KCNE1 and their associated phenotypes, including biallelic truncating null variants of KCNE1 that have not been previously reported. We describe three homozygous nonsense mutations of KCNE1 segregating in families ascertained ostensibly for nonsyndromic deafness: c.50G>A (p.Trp17*), c.51G>A (p.Trp17*), and c.138C>A (p.Tyr46*). Some individuals carrying missense variants of KCNE1 have RWS. However, heterozygotes for loss-of-function variants of KCNE1 may have normal QT intervals while biallelic null alleles are associated with JLNS2, indicating a complex genotype-phenotype spectrum for KCNE1 variants.", "Keywords": ["Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome", "KCNE1", "KCNQ1", "Romano-Ward syndrome", "deafness", "prolonged-QT"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Codon, Nonsense", "Deafness", "Female", "Heart Ventricles", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Jervell-Lange Nielsen Syndrome", "Long QT Syndrome", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated", "Romano-Ward Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rabia", "Last Name": "Faridi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Risa", "Last Name": "Tona", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Brofferio", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hoa", "Affiliation": "Auditory Development and Restoration Program, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rafal", "Last Name": "Olszewski", "Affiliation": "Auditory Development and Restoration Program, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Z K", "Last Name": "Assir", "Affiliation": "Allama Iqbal Medical Research Centre, Jinnah Hospital Complex, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Akhtar A", "Last Name": "Bandesha", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Department, The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Asma A", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "National Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Atteeq U", "Last Name": "Rehman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Brewer", "Affiliation": "Audiology Unit, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheikh", "Last Name": "Riazuddin", "Affiliation": "Allama Iqbal Medical Research Centre, Jinnah Hospital Complex, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Boyden", "Affiliation": "Section on Genetics of Communication Disorders, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas B", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}], "Journal": "Human mutation", "PubDate": "2019Feb"}, {"PMID": "30395363", "Title": "FAM92A Underlies Nonsyndromic Postaxial Polydactyly in Humans and an Abnormal Limb and Digit Skeletal Phenotype in Mice.", "Abstract": "Polydactyly is a common congenital anomaly of the hand and foot. Postaxial polydactyly (PAP) is characterized by one or more posterior or postaxial digits. In a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), we performed genomewide genotyping, linkage analysis, and exome and Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense variant (c.478C>T, p.[Arg160*]) in the FAM92A gene within the mapped region on 8q21.13-q24.12 that segregated with the PAPA phenotype. We found that FAM92A is expressed in the developing mouse limb and E11.5 limb bud including the progress zone and the apical ectodermal ridge, where it strongly localizes at the cilia level, suggesting an important role in limb patterning. The identified variant leads to a loss of the FAM92A/Chibby1 complex that is crucial for ciliogenesis and impairs the recruitment and the colocalization of FAM92A with Chibby1 at the base of the cilia. In addition, we show that Fam92a-/- homozygous mice also exhibit an abnormal digit morphology, including metatarsal osteomas and polysyndactyly, in addition to distinct abnormalities on the deltoid tuberosity of their humeri.

In this study, we utilized genome-wide genotyping, Sanger and exome sequencing to identify 163 DNA variants in 41 previously reported HL genes segregating in 321 Pakistani families. Of these, 70 (42.9%) variants identified in 29 genes are novel. As expected from genetic studies of disorders segregating in consanguineous families, the majority of affected individuals (94.4%) are homozygous for HL-associated variants, with the other variants being compound heterozygotes. The five most common HL genes in the Pakistani population are SLC26A4, MYO7A, GJB2, CIB2 and HGF, respectively. Our study provides a profile of the genetic etiology of HL in Pakistani families, which will allow for the development of more efficient genetic diagnostic tools, aid in accurate genetic counseling, and guide application of future gene-based therapies. These findings are also valuable in interpreting pathogenicity of variants that are potentially associated with HL in individuals of all ancestries.

Two known variants: c.250delC (p.Leu84*) and c.380\u2009A\u2009>\u2009G (p.Tyr127Cys) were also observed in two families and a single family, respectively. Nucleotides c.452G and c.*16\u2009+\u20091G and amino-acid residue p.Gly151 are under strong evolutionary conservation. In silico bioinformatics analyses predicted these variants to be damaging. The splice site variant (c.*16\u2009+\u20091\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A) is predicted to affect pre-mRNA splicing and a loss of the 5' donor splice site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Further analysis supports the activation of a cryptic splice site approximately 357-bp downstream, leading to an extended 3'-UTR with additional regulatory motifs. In conclusion, we identified two novel variants in LHFPL5, including a unique 3'-UTR splice site variant that is predicted to impact pre-mRNA splicing and regulation through an extended 3'-UTR.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "RNA Splice Sites"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khurram", "Last Name": "Liaqat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Ilene", "Last Name": "Chiu", "Affiliation": "Bobby R Alford Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Imen", "Last Name": "Chakchouk", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paula B", "Last Name": "Andrade-Elizondo", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shabir", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Shoaib", "Last Name": "Nawaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Ansar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Nasim", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Sulman", "Last Name": "Basit", "Affiliation": "Center for Genetics and Inherited Diseases, Taibah University, Almadinah Almunawwarah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. sleal@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2018Nov"}, {"PMID": "30167849", "Title": "Novel candidate genes and variants underlying autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorders with intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Identification of Mendelian genes for neurodevelopmental disorders using exome sequencing to study autosomal recessive (AR) consanguineous pedigrees has been highly successful.

612530). Within this group, a predominant phenotype of developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, distinct dysmorphology, and brain anomalies on magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography has emerged. Previous reports of patients with de novo deletions at 1q41-q42 have led to the identification of an evolving smallest region of overlap which has included several potentially causal genes including DISP1, TP53BP2, and FBXO28. In a recent report, a cohort of patients with de novo mutations in WDR26 was described that shared many of the clinical features originally described in the 1q41-q42 microdeletion syndrome (MDS). Here, we describe a novel germline FBXO28 frameshift mutation in a 3-year-old girl with intractable epilepsy, ID, DD, and other features which overlap those of the 1q41-q42 MDS. Through a familial whole-exome sequencing study, we identified a de novo FBXO28 c.972_973delACinsG (p.Arg325GlufsX3) frameshift mutation in the proband. The frameshift and resulting premature nonsense mutation have not been reported in any genomic database. This child does not have a large 1q41-q42 deletion, nor does she harbor a WDR26 mutation. Our case joins a previously reported patient also in whom FBXO28 was affected but WDR26 was not. These findings support the idea that FBXO28 is a monogenic disease gene and contributes to the complex neurodevelopmental phenotype of the 1q41-q42 gene deletion syndrome.", "Keywords": ["1q41q42", "F-Box protein 28", "FBXO28", "SCF complex", "WDR26", "chromosome 1q41-q42 deletion syndrome", "dominant negative", "intellectual disability", "seizures"], "MeSH terms": ["Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Child, Preschool", "Chromosome Deletion", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1", "Developmental Disabilities", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Exome", "Female", "Frameshift Mutation", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Prognosis", "SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Balak", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Newell", "Last Name": "Belnap", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Keri", "Last Name": "Ramsey", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Shelagh", "Last Name": "Joss", "Affiliation": "West of Scotland Genetics Service, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Koen", "Last Name": "Devriendt", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Genetics (Centrum Menselijke Erfelijkheid), University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Marcus", "Last Name": "Naymik", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Wayne", "Last Name": "Jepsen", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Ashley L", "Last Name": "Siniard", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Szabolcs", "Last Name": "Szelinger", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Richholt", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Tyler", "Last Name": "Izatt", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Madison", "Last Name": "LaFleur", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Panieh", "Last Name": "Terraf", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Lorida", "Last Name": "Llaci", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "De Both", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Ignazio S", "Last Name": "Piras", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Sampathkumar", "Last Name": "Rangasamy", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "Huentelman", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Vinodh", "Last Name": "Narayanan", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD), Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Until recently, the cause of many epileptic encephalopathies was unknown. Whole exome or whole genome sequencing has led to the identification of several causal genes in individuals with epileptic encephalopathy, and the list of genes has now expanded greatly. Genetic testing with epilepsy gene panels is now done quite early in the evaluation of children with epilepsy, following brain imaging, electroencephalogram, and metabolic profile. Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE1; OMIM #308350) is the earliest of these age-dependent encephalopathies, manifesting as tonic spasms, myoclonic seizures, or partial seizures, with severely abnormal electroencephalogram, often showing a suppression-burst pattern. In this case study, we describe a 33-month-old female child with severe, neonatal onset epileptic encephalopathy. An infantile epilepsy gene panel test revealed 2 novel heterozygous variants in the MECP2 gene; a 70-bp deletion resulting in a frameshift and truncation (p.Lys377ProfsX9) thought to be pathogenic, and a 6-bp in-frame deletion (p.His371_372del), designated as a variant of unknown significance. Based on this test result, the diagnosis of atypical Rett syndrome (RTT) was made. Family-based targeted testing and segregation analysis, however, raised questions about the pathogenicity of these specific MECP2 variants. Whole exome sequencing was performed in this family trio, leading to the discovery of a rare, de novo, missense mutation in GNAO1 (p. Leu284Ser). De novo, heterozygous mutations in GNAO1 have been reported to cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-17 (EIEE17; OMIM 615473). The child's severe phenotype, the family history and segregation analysis of variants and prior reports of GNAO1-linked disease allowed us to conclude that the GNAO1 mutation, and not the MECP2 variants, was the cause of this child's neurological disease. With the increased use of genetic panels and whole exome sequencing, we will be confronted with lists of gene variants suspected to be pathogenic or of unknown significance.

The crucial function of Greb1l in craniofacial development is also evidenced in knockout mice, which develop severe craniofacial abnormalities. In addition, we show that Greb1l-/- zebrafish exhibit a loss of abnormal sensory epithelia innervation. An important role for Greb1l in sensory epithelia innervation development is supported by the eighth cranial nerve deficiencies seen in both affected subjects. In conclusion, we demonstrate that GREB1L is a key player in early inner ear and eighth cranial nerve development. Abnormalities in cochleovestibular anatomy can provide challenges for cochlear implantation. Combining a molecular diagnosis with imaging techniques might aid the development of individually tailored therapeutic interventions in the future.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals",

To achieve a better understanding of the pathways modulated by rs17070145 and its associated functional variant(s), we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-sequencing to investigate the effect of rs17070145 genotypes on whole transcriptome expression in the human hippocampus (HP) of 22 neuropathologically normal individuals, with a specific focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) and at the pyramidal cells (PC) of CA1 and CA3 sub-regions. Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data within the HP based on the rs17070145 genotype revealed an overexpression of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, potentially driven by the T/T genotype. The most important contribution comes from genes dysregulated within the DG region. Other genes significantly dysregulated, and not involved in the MAPK pathway (Adj P\u2009<\u20090.01 and Fold Change\u2009>\u2009|1.00|) were: RSPO4 (HP); ARC, DUSP5, DNAJB5, EGR4, PPP1R15A, WBP11P1, EGR1, GADD45B (DG); CH25H, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, TNFSF9, and NPAS4 (PC). Several evidences suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway is linked with memory and learning processes. In non-neuronal cells, the KIBRA protein is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (involved in the MAPK signaling) in cells as well as in vitro. Several of the other dysregulated genes are involved in memory and learning processes, as well as in Alzheimer's Disease.

To study the mechanism of hearing impairment resulting from CABP2 loss of function, we disrupted Cabp2 in mice (Cabp2LacZ/LacZ ). CaBP2 was expressed by cochlear hair cells, preferentially in inner hair cells (IHCs), and was lacking from the postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Cabp2LacZ/LacZ mice displayed intact cochlear amplification but impaired auditory brainstem responses. Patch-clamp recordings from Cabp2LacZ/LacZ IHCs revealed enhanced Ca2+-channel inactivation.

As this is seen as inadequate, there is a need for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB2 with our panel leads to a diagnosis in 25%-30% of patients. Our data show that after GJB2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC1, MYO15A, and MYO7A (3.1%). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants.

It may be the result of an acquired insult to the brain, such prenatal or perinatal brain injury (congenital infection or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy), or be a part of a genetic syndrome. There are over 1000 conditions listed in OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) where microcephaly is a key finding; many of these are associated with specific somatic features and non-CNS anomalies. The term primary microcephaly is used when microcephaly and delayed development are the primary features, and they are not part of another recognized syndrome. In this case report, we present the clinical features of siblings (brother and sister) with primary microcephaly and delayed development, and subtle dysmorphic features. Both children had brain MRI studies that showed periventricular and subcortical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, without signs of white matter volume loss, and no parenchymal calcifications by CT scan. The family was enrolled in a research study for whole exome sequencing of probands and parents.

Proper development and life-long function of these structures involves a highly complex coordinated system of spatial and temporal gene expression. The characterization of the inner ear transcriptome is likely important for the functional study of auditory and vestibular components, yet, primarily due to tissue unavailability, detailed expression catalogues of the human inner ear remain largely incomplete. We report here, for the first time, comprehensive transcriptome characterization of the adult human cochlea, ampulla, saccule and utricle of the vestibule obtained from patients without hearing abnormalities. Using RNA-Seq, we measured the expression of >50,000 predicted genes corresponding to approximately 200,000 transcripts, in the adult inner ear and compared it to 32 other human tissues. First, we identified genes preferentially expressed in the inner ear, and unique either to the vestibule or cochlea. Next, we examined expression levels of specific groups of potentially interesting RNAs, such as genes implicated in hearing loss, long non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes and transcripts subject to nonsense mediated decay (NMD). We uncover the spatial specificity of expression of these RNAs in the hearing/balance system, and reveal evidence of tissue specific NMD. Lastly, we investigated the non-syndromic deafness loci to which no gene has been mapped, and narrow the list of potential candidates for each locus. These data represent the first high-resolution transcriptome catalogue of the adult human inner ear. A comprehensive identification of coding and non-coding RNAs in the inner ear will enable pathways of auditory and vestibular function to be further defined in the study of hearing and balance.

This revealed a de novo, heterozygous, frame-shift mutation in the Caveolin1 gene (CAV1) (p.Phe160X). Mutations in CAV1, encoding the main component of the caveolae in plasma membranes, cause Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 3 (BSCL). Although BSCL is recessive, heterozygous carriers either show a reduced phenotype of partial lipodystrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or no phenotype. To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this syndrome in more depth, we performed next generation RNA sequencing of peripheral blood, which showed several dysregulated pathways in the patient that might be related to the phenotypic progeroid features (apoptosis, DNA repair/replication, mitochondrial). Secondly, we found a significant down-regulation of known Cav1 interaction partners, verifying the dysfunction of CAV1. Other known progeroid genes and lipodystrophy genes were also dysregulated. Next, western blotting of lysates of cultured fibroblasts showed that the patient shows a significantly decreased expression of wild-type CAV1 protein, demonstrating a loss-of-function mutation, though her phenotype is more severe that other heterozygotes with similar mutations. This phenotypic variety could be explained by differences in genetic background. Indications for this are supported by additional rare variants we found in AGPAT2 and LPIN1 lipodystrophy genes. CAV1, AGPAT2 and LPIN1 all play an important role in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in adipose tissue, and the defective function in different parts of this pathway, though not all to the same extend, could contribute to a more severe lipoatrophic phenotype in this patient. In conclusion, we report, for the first time, an association of CAV1 dysfunction with a syndrome of severe premature aging and lipodystrophy. This may contribute to a better understanding of the aging process and pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to premature aging.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acyltransferases", "Caveolin 1", "Child, Preschool", "Codon, Nonsense", "Female", "Fetal Growth Retardation", "Frameshift Mutation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Lipodystrophy, Congenital Generalized", "Phenotype", "Phosphatidate Phosphatase", "Progeria", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Rare Childhood Disorders, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States of America;

dosage compensatory mechanism by inactivation of one copy of X in cells. Random XCI of one of the parental chromosomes results in an approximately equal proportion of cells expressing alleles from either the maternally or paternally inherited active X, and is defined by the XCI ratio. Skewed XCI ratio is suggestive of non-random inactivation, which can play an important role in X-linked genetic conditions. Current methods rely on indirect, semi-quantitative DNA methylation-based assay to estimate XCI ratio. Here we report a direct approach to estimate XCI ratio by integrated, family-trio based whole-exome and mRNA sequencing using phase-by-transmission of alleles coupled with allele-specific expression analysis. We applied this method to in silico data and to a clinical patient with mild cognitive impairment but no clear diagnosis or understanding molecular mechanism underlying the phenotype. Simulation showed that phased and unphased heterozygous allele expression can be used to estimate XCI ratio. Segregation analysis of the patient's exome uncovered a de novo, interstitial, 1.7 Mb deletion on Xp22.31 that originated on the paternally inherited X and previously been associated with heterogeneous, neurological phenotype. Phased, allelic expression data suggested an 83\u223620 moderately skewed XCI that favored the expression of the maternally inherited, cytogenetically normal X and suggested that the deleterious affect of the de novo event on the paternal copy may be offset by skewed XCI that favors expression of the wild-type X.

Genetic risk loci for NME previously were identified in pug dogs, particularly associated with the dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II complex on chromosome 12, but have not been investigated in other susceptible breeds. We sought to evaluate Maltese and Chihuahua dogs, in addition to pug dogs, to identify novel or shared genetic risk factors for NME development. Genome-wide association testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Maltese dogs with NME identified 2 regions of genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4 (chr4:74522353T>A, p\u200a=\u200a8.1\u00d710-7) and 15 (chr15:53338796A>G, p\u200a=\u200a1.5\u00d710-7). Haplotype analysis and fine-mapping suggests that ILR7 and FBXW7, respectively, both important for regulation of immune system function, could be the underlying associated genes. Further evaluation of these regions and the previously identified DLA II locus across all three breeds, revealed an enrichment of nominal significant SNPs associated with chromosome 15 in pug dogs and DLA II in Maltese and Chihuahua dogs. Meta-analysis confirmed effect sizes the same direction in all three breeds for both the chromosome 15 and DLA II loci (p\u200a=\u200a8.6\u00d710-11 and p\u200a=\u200a2.5\u00d710-7, respectively). This suggests a shared genetic background exists between all breeds and confers susceptibility to NME, but effect sizes might be different among breeds. In conclusion, we identified the first genetic risk factors for NME development in the Maltese, chromosome 4 and chromosome 15, and provide evidence for a shared genetic risk between breeds associated with chromosome 15 and DLA II.

The screening of seven candidate genes, failed to reveal any disease-causing mutations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2", "Consanguinity", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Genetic Linkage", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Pedigree", "Tunisia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohamed", "Last Name": "Ali Mosrati", "Affiliation": "Microorganisms and Biomolecules Laboratory, Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariem", "Last Name": "Ben Saiid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mounira", "Last Name": "Aifa-Hmani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Fransen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Malek", "Last Name": "Mneja", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abdelmonem", "Last Name": "Ghorbel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Van Camp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saber", "Last Name": "Masmoudi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "23208854", "Title": "A sensitive and specific diagnostic test for hearing loss using a microdroplet PCR-based approach and next generation sequencing.", "Abstract": "Implementing DNA diagnostics in clinical practice for extremely heterogeneous diseases such as hearing loss is challenging, especially when attempting to reach high sensitivity and specificity in a cost-effective fashion. Next generation sequencing has enabled the development of such a test, but the most commonly used genomic target enrichment methods such as hybridization-based capture suffer from restrictions. In this study, we have adopted a new flexible approach using microdroplet PCR-based technology for target enrichment, in combination with massive parallel sequencing to develop a DNA diagnostic test for autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss. This approach enabled us to identify the genetic basis of hearing loss in 9 of 24 patients, a success rate of 37.5%. Our method also proved to have high sensitivity and specificity. Currently, routine molecular genetic diagnostic testing for deafness is in most cases only performed for the GJB2 gene and a positive result is typically only obtained in 10-20% of deaf children. Individuals with mutations in GJB2 had already been excluded in our selected set of 24 patients. Therefore, we anticipate that our deafness test may lead to a genetic diagnosis in roughly 50% of unscreened autosomal recessive deafness cases. We propose that this diagnostic testing approach represents a significant improvement in clinical practice as a standard diagnostic tool for children with hearing loss.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Connexin 26", "Connexins", "Deafness", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Mutation", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Manou", "Last Name": "Sommen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason J", "Last Name": "Corneveaux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Reiman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole J", "Last Name": "Hackett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charlotte", "Last Name": "Claes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathleen", "Last Name": "Claes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Bitner-Glindzicz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Coucke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Van Camp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Huentelman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.
