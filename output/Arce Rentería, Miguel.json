However, cognitive function does not lend itself to direct comparison across diverse populations without careful consideration of the best practices for such comparisons. This perspective discusses theoretical and methodological considerations and offers a set of recommended best practices for conducting cross-national comparisons of risk factor associations using HCAP data. Because existing and planned HCAP studies provide cognition data representing an estimated 75% of the global population \u226565 years of age, these recommended best practices will support high-quality comparative analyses of cognitive aging around the world. The principles described in this perspective are applicable to any researcher aiming to integrate or compare harmonized data on cognitive outcomes and their risk and protective factors across diverse populations.", "Keywords": ["cognitive function", "cognitive impairment", "cross-cultural research", "cross-national comparisons", "harmonization", "measurement"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cognition", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lindsay C", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard N", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Brice\u00f1o", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miguel Arce", "Last Name": "Renter\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Meijer", "Affiliation": "Center for Economic and Social Research, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Langa", "Affiliation": "Survey Research Center, University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinkook", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Economic and Social Research, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alden L", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}], "Journal": "Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "38096115", "Title": "Neurocognitive, Sociocultural, and Psychological Factors Impacting Medication Beliefs Among HIV-Seropositive Latinx Adults.", "Abstract": "Among Latinx people living with HIV (PLWH), neurocognitive (NC) function, culture, and mental health impact medication adherence.

This is especially relevant for Latinx PLWH who are disproportionately impacted by HIV, given that sociocultural factors may uniquely impact HIV-related NC and psychological sequelae. This study investigated the associations between neurocognition, sociocultural factors, mental health, health beliefs, and health attitudes among Latinx HIV-seropositive adults. Within a sample of 100 Latinx PLWH, better verbal learning and executive functioning abilities were associated with more positive attitudes about the benefits of medications and memory for medications. In terms of sociocultural factors, higher English language competence was related to better self-reported memory for medications, and overall, higher US acculturation was associated with more positive attitudes toward health professionals. Depressive symptomatology was negatively associated with attitudes toward medications and health professionals, as well as with self-reported memory for medications. These findings highlight the important interplay between NC, sociocultural, psychological factors, and health beliefs among Latinx PLWH.

Baseline PENK-A was measured in a nested case-control study of 462 participants who developed cognitive impairment over 4.7\u2009years, and 556 controls.

We identified DCDC2 gene significantly associated with episodic memory (Pmeta\u00a0=\u00a03.3 x 10-8 ) among non-carriers of APOE \u03b54 (N\u00a0=\u00a024,941). Brain transcriptomics revealed an association between episodic memory maintenance and (1) increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DCDC2 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a03.8 x 10-4 ) and (2) lower burden of pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks (paired helical fragment tau P\u00a0=\u00a0.003, and amyloid beta load P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Additional transcriptomics results comparing AD and cognitively healthy brain samples showed a downregulation of DCDC2 levels in superior temporal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and inferior frontal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.013). Our work identified DCDC2 gene as a novel predictor of memory maintenance.", "Keywords": ["apolipoprotein E stratified analyses", "brain transcriptomics", "episodic memory trajectories (EMTs)",

older adults.", "Abstract": "The brain signature concept aims to characterize brain regions most strongly associated with an outcome of interest. Brain signatures derive their power from data-driven searches that select features based solely on performance metrics of prediction or classification. This approach has important potential to delineate biologically relevant brain substrates for prediction or classification of future trajectories. Recent work has used exploratory voxel-wise or atlas-based searches, with some using machine learning techniques to define salient features. These have shown undoubted usefulness, but two issues remain. The preponderance of recent work has been aimed at categorical rather than continuous outcomes, and it is rare for non-atlas reliant voxel-based signatures to be reported that would be useful for modelling and hypothesis testing. We describe a cross-validated signature region model for structural brain components associated with baseline and longitudinal episodic memory across cognitively heterogeneous populations including normal, mild impairment and dementia. We used three non-overlapping cohorts of older participants: from the UC Davis Aging and Diversity cohort (n\u2009=\u2009255; mean age 75.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1 years; 128 cognitively normal, 97 mild cognitive impairment, 30 demented and seven unclassified); from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 (n\u2009=\u2009379; mean age 75.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2; 82 cognitively normal, 176 mild cognitive impairment, 121 Alzheimer's dementia); and from ADNI2/GO (n\u2009=\u2009680; mean age 72.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1; 220 cognitively normal, 381 mild cognitive impairment and 79 Alzheimer's dementia). We used voxel-wise regression analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons, to generate an array of regional masks corresponding to different association strength levels of cortical grey matter with baseline memory and brain atrophy with memory change. Cognitive measures were episodic memory using Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales instruments for UC Davis and ADNI-Mem for ADNI 1 and ADNI2/GO. Performance metric was the adjusted R2 coefficient of determination of each model explaining outcomes in two cohorts other than where it was computed. We compared within-cohort performances of signature models against each other and against other recent signature models of episodic memory. Findings were: (i) two independently generated signature region of interest models performed similarly in a third separate cohort; (ii) a signature region of interest generated in one imaging cohort replicated its performance level when explaining cognitive outcomes in each of other, separate cohorts; and (iii) this approach better explained baseline and longitudinal memory than other recent theory-driven and data-driven models. This suggests our approach can generate signatures that may be easily and robustly applied for modelling and hypothesis testing in mixed cognition cohorts.", "Keywords": ["brain signature", "cross-validation", "episodic memory", "grey matter density", "longitudinal atrophy"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Computer Simulation", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Neuroimaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Fletcher", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Gavett", "Affiliation": "School of Psychological Science, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Crane", "Affiliation": "University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anja", "Last Name": "Soldan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Hohman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Farias", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Widaman", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Education, UC Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Groot", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Miguel Arce", "Last Name": "Renteria", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "DeCarli", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Mungas", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2021May07"}, {"PMID": "33784376", "Title": "Longitudinal Relationship of Leisure Activity Engagement With Cognitive Performance Among Non-Demented, Community-Dwelling Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Leisure activity engagement (LAE) may reduce the risk of incident dementia.

Currently, we have a limited understanding of the degree to which cognitive difficulties observed in HIV+ High-ELS samples reflect underlying neural abnormalities rather than increases in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Here, we utilized a behavioral marker of cognitive function, reaction time intra-individual variability (RT-IIV), which is sensitive to both brain volume reductions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, to elucidate the unique contributions of brain volume abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptoms to cognitive difficulties in HIV+ High-ELS adults. We assessed the relation of RT-IIV to neuropsychiatric symptom levels and total gray and white matter volumes in 44 HIV+ adults (26 with high ELS). RT-IIV was examined during a working memory task. Self-report measures assessed current neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify total gray and white matter volumes. Compared to Low-ELS participants, High-ELS participants exhibited elevated RT-IIV, elevated neuropsychiatric symptoms, and reduced gray and white matter volumes. Across the entire sample, RT-IIV was significantly associated with gray and white matter volumes, whereas significant associations with neuropsychiatric symptoms were not observed. In the High-ELS group, despite the presence of elevated neuropsychiatric symptom levels, brain volume reductions explained more than 13% of the variance in RT-IIV, whereas neuropsychiatric symptoms explained less than 1%. Collectively, these data provide evidence that, in HIV+ High-ELS adults, ELS-related cognitive difficulties (as indexed by RT-IIV) exhibit strong associations with global brain volumes, whereas ELS-related elevations in neuropsychiatric symptoms appear to contribute minimally to these cognitive difficulties. Such findings support a growing body of evidence indicating that high ELS exposure is a significant risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV+ adults. Further, these data highlight the need to better understand how ELS-related pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to volumetric and other neural abnormalities in HIV+ individuals.", "Keywords": ["adverse childhood experiences", "childhood abuse", "childhood trauma", "gray matter", "reaction time variability", "subjective cognitive complaints", "white matter"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uraina S", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Arce Renter\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Fordham University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rachal R", "Last Name": "Hegde", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Morgello", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "28988793", "Title": "The Combined Roles of Nonsomatic Depressive Symptomatology, Neurocognitive Function, and Current Substance Use in Medication Adherence in Adults Living With HIV Infection.", "Abstract": "Depression, global neurocognitive (GNC) function, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are each associated with medication adherence in persons living with HIV (PLWH).

Concurrently, the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive (NC) impairment remains high. This study examined the effects of age and ethnicity on NC function in HIV-positive adults. The sample (N = 126; 84 Latina/o and 42 Non-Hispanic White) completed a comprehensive NC battery. Global NC and domain average demographically-corrected t-scores were generated. There were no significant differences between Younger (<50 years) Latina/os and non-Hispanic Whites on Global NC function or NC domains (all p's >.10), with generally small effect sizes. Older Latina/os (\u226550 years) were significantly more impaired than Older Non-Hispanic Whites on processing speed and learning, with trends in Global NC function and memory. Further, effect sizes fell within the medium to large range (Cohen's d's = .49-1.15). This study suggests that older Latina/os are at potentially greater risk for NC impairment, particularly in processing speed and learning, when compared to similarly-aged non-Hispanic whites.", "Keywords": ["AIDS", "HAND", "HIV", "Hispanics", "Latina/os", "aging", "cognition", "health disparities", "neurocognitive", "neuropsychological impairment"], "MeSH terms": ["Acculturation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "HIV Seropositivity", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica Rivera", "Last Name": "Mindt", "Affiliation": "a Fordham University, Latino American Latino Studies Institute at Fordham University, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Miranda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alyssa", "Last Name": "Arentoft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Desiree", "Last Name": "Byrd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Monzones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Armando", "Last Name": "Fuentes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Arias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Miguel Arce", "Last Name": "Renter\u00eda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ana", "Last Name": "Rosario", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Morgello", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Behavioral medicine (Washington, D.C.)", "PubDate": "2014"}]
