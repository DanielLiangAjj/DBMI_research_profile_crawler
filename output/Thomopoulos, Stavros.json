[{"PMID": "38941456", "Title": "Python tooth-inspired fixation device for enhanced rotator cuff repair.", "Abstract": "Rotator cuff repair surgeries fail frequently, with 20 to 94% of the 600,000 repairs performed annually in the United States resulting in retearing of the rotator cuff. The most common cause of failure is sutures tearing through tendons at grasping points. To address this issue, we drew inspiration from the specialized teeth of snakes of the Pythonoidea superfamily, which grasp soft tissues without tearing. To apply this nondamaging gripping approach to the surgical repair of tendon, we developed and optimized a python tooth-inspired device as an adjunct to current rotator cuff suture repair and found that it nearly doubled repair strength. Integrated simulations, 3D printing, and ex vivo experiments revealed a relationship between tooth shape and grasping mechanics, enabling optimization of the clinically relevant device that substantially enhances rotator cuff repair by distributing stresses over the attachment footprint. This approach suggests an alternative to traditional suturing paradigms and may reduce the risk of tendon retearing after rotator cuff repair.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Rotator Cuff", "Boidae", "Rotator Cuff Injuries", "Tooth", "Suture Techniques", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Humans", "Printing, Three-Dimensional"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Iden", "Last Name": "Kurtaliaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ethan D", "Last Name": "Hoppe", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuxuan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Ju", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob A", "Last Name": "Sandler", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donghwan", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lester J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvio Torres", "Last Name": "Betancur", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Effiong", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liana", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sohil", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Birman", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, St. Louis, MO 65409, USA."}, {"First Name": "William N", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "Genin", "Affiliation": "NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2024Jun28"}, {"PMID": "38657023", "Title": "The subacromial bursa modulates tendon healing after rotator cuff injury in rats.", "Abstract": "Rotator cuff injuries result in more than 500,000 surgeries annually in the United States, many of which fail. These surgeries typically involve repair of the injured tendon and removal of the subacromial bursa, a synovial-like tissue that sits between the rotator cuff and the acromion. The subacromial bursa has been implicated in rotator cuff pathogenesis and healing. Using proteomic profiling of bursa samples from nine patients with rotator cuff injury, we show that the bursa responds to injury in the underlying tendon. In a rat model of supraspinatus tenotomy, we evaluated the bursa's effect on the injured supraspinatus tendon, the uninjured infraspinatus tendon, and the underlying humeral head. The bursa protected the intact infraspinatus tendon adjacent to the injured supraspinatus tendon by maintaining its mechanical properties and protected the underlying humeral head by maintaining bone morphometry. The bursa promoted an inflammatory response in injured rat tendon, initiating expression of genes associated with wound healing, including Cox2 and Il6. These results were confirmed in rat bursa organ cultures. To evaluate the potential of the bursa as a therapeutic target, polymer microspheres loaded with dexamethasone were delivered to the intact bursae of rats after tenotomy. Dexamethasone released from the bursa reduced Il1b expression in injured rat supraspinatus tendon, suggesting that the bursa could be used for drug delivery to reduce inflammation in the healing tendon.

Gli1+ cells have been described as putative stem cells in several tissues and are presumed to play critical roles in tissue formation and maintenance. For example, the enthesis, a fibrocartilage tissue that connects tendon to bone, is mineralized postnatally by a pool of Gli1+ progenitor cells. These cells are regulated by hedgehog signaling, but it is unclear if TGF\u03b2 signaling, necessary for tenogenesis, also plays a role in their behavior. To examine the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in Gli1+ cell function, the receptor for TGF\u03b2, TbR2, was deleted in Gli1-lineage cells in mice at P5. Decreased TGF\u03b2 signaling in these cells led to defects in tendon enthesis formation by P56, including defective bone morphometry underlying the enthesis and decreased mechanical properties. Immunohistochemical staining of these Gli1+ cells showed that loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. In\u00a0vitro experiments using Gli1+ cells isolated from mouse tail tendons demonstrated that TGF\u03b2 controls cell proliferation and differentiation through canonical and non-canonical pathways and that TGF\u03b2 directly controls the tendon transcription factor scleraxis by binding to its distant enhancer.

Prior efforts to broadly suppress this inflammatory response have been largely unsuccessful. Recent studies have shown that selective inhibition of\u00a0IkappaB kinase beta\u00a0(IKK-\u03b2), an upstream activator of\u00a0nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells\u00a0(NF-\u03baB) signaling, mitigates the early inflammatory response and leads to improved tendon healing outcomes. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that oral treatment with the IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor ACHP (2-amino-6-[2-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl]-4-piperidin-4-yl nicotinenitrile an inhibitor) will modulate the postoperative inflammatory response and improve intrasynovial flexor tendon healing. To test this hypothesis, the flexor digitorum profundus tendon of 21 canines was transected and repaired within the intrasynovial region and assessed after 3 and 14 days. Histomorphometry, gene expression analyses, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polarized light imaging\u00a0were used to examine ACHP-mediated changes. ACHP led to reduction in phosphorylated p-65, indicating that NF-\u03baB activity was suppressed. ACHP enhanced expression of inflammation-related genes at 3 days and suppressed expression of these genes at 14 days. Histomorphometry revealed enhanced cellular proliferation and neovascularization in ACHP-treated tendons compared with time-matched controls. These findings demonstrate that ACHP effectively suppressed NF-\u03baB signaling and modulated early inflammation, leading to increased cellular proliferation and neovascularization without stimulating the formation of fibrovascular adhesions. Together, these data suggest that ACHP treatment accelerated the inflammatory and proliferative phases of tendon healing following intrasynovial flexor tendon repair.

Although numerous studies have been performed to identify suturing strategies that reduce this risk by balancing forces across sutures, none have accounted for how the viscoelastic nature of tendon influences load sharing. With the aim of providing insight into this problem, we studied how tendon viscoelasticity, tendon stiffness, and suture anchor spacing affect this balancing of forces across sutures. Results from a model of a three-row sutured re-attachment demonstrated that optimized distributions of suture stiffnesses and of the spacing of suture anchors can balance the forces across sutures to within a few percent, even when accounting for tendon viscoelasticity.

Herein, this study established an injury model to the Achilles entheses of neonatal mice to study the effectiveness of early-age enthesis healing. Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed an atypical process that did not involve inflammation or angiogenesis. Instead, healing was mediated by secretion of collagen types I and II by resident cells, which formed a permanent hypocellular and avascular scar. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the cellular response to injury, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and cell death, varied between the tendon and cartilage ends of the enthesis. Single-molecule in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays verified these differences. Finally, gait analysis showed that these processes effectively restored function of the injured leg.

In contrast, well-vascularized extrasynovial flexor tendons possess high levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes and have a markedly improved healing capacity. This study was designed to compare the metabolic profiles of the two types of tendons and to evaluate the impact of metabolic reprogramming on early intrasynovial tendon healing in a clinically relevant canine model. Results showed that healthy intrasynovial tendons expressed higher levels of PDK1 and GAPDH and lower levels of SCX and IGF1 than did extrasynovial tendons. PDK1 encodes a subtype of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) that inhibits OXPHOS. Consistently, ATP production via glycolysis was favored in intrasynovial tendon cells whereas OXPHOS was the preferred pathway in extrasynovial tendon cells. Inhibition of glycolysis in vitro increased SCX expression in intrasynovial tendon cells. Therefore, dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK1 inhibitor, was used in vivo to shift intrasynovial tendon ATP production from glycolysis to OXPHOS. Oral DCA administration reduced serum lactate concentration and increased acetyl-CoA content in repaired intrasynovial tendons and led to reduced TLR4 and IL1B and increased IGF1, SCX, and TGFB3 expressions in treated intrasynovial tendons compared to controls.

In order to address this knowledge gap, stress relaxation and creep tests at various stress (5-35 MPa) and strain (5-20%) levels were performed with individual collagen fibrils (average diameter of fully hydrated fibrils: 253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021 nm) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The experimental results showed that the time-dependent mechanical behavior of fully hydrated individual collagen fibrils reconstituted from Type I calf skin collagen, is described by strain-dependent stress relaxation and stress-dependent creep functions in both the heel-toe and the linear regimes of deformation in monotonic stress-strain curves. The adaptive quasilinear viscoelastic (QLV) model, originally developed to capture the nonlinear viscoelastic response of collagenous tissues, provided a very good description of the nonlinear stress relaxation and creep behavior of the collagen fibrils. On the other hand, the nonlinear superposition (NSP) model fitted well the creep but not the stress relaxation data. The time constants and rates extracted from the adaptive QLV and the NSP models, respectively, pointed to a faster rate for stress relaxation than creep. This nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of individual collagen fibrils agrees with prior studies of macroscale collagenous tissues, thus demonstrating consistent time-dependent behavior across length scales and tissue hierarchies.

Here, a biocompatible, graded, 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl chitosan (BGC) bioadhesive designed to meet these needs is presented. Although 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl chitosan (DP-chitosan) bioadhesives are biocompatible, their adhesion strength is low; soluble oxidants or cross-linking agents can be added for higher bonding strength, but this sacrifices biocompatibility. These challenges are overcome by developing a periodate-modified ion exchange resin-bead filtration system that oxidizes catechol moieties to quinones and filters off the activating agent and resin.

Integrating experiments, simulations, and previously unexplored imaging that enabled simultaneous observation of mineralized and unmineralized tissues, we identified putative mechanisms of enthesis toughening in a mouse model and then manipulated these mechanisms via in vivo control of mineralization and architecture.

BtxA mice exhibited abnormalities in gait compared to controls through 10 weeks of age, but these differences did not persist into adulthood. BtxA shoulders had decreased bone volume (-9%) and abnormal trabecular microstructure compared to controls. Histomorphometry analysis demonstrated that BtxA shoulders had higher murine shoulder arthritis scale scores (+30%), and therefore more shoulder OA compared to controls. Articular cartilage of BtxA shoulders demonstrated stiffening of the tissue. Compared with controls, articular cartilage from BtxA shoulders had 2-fold and 10-fold decreases in Dkk1 and BMP2 expression, respectively, and 3-fold and 14-fold increases in Col10A1 and BGLAP expression, respectively, consistent with established models of OA.

However, etiological studies are difficult to perform in patients due to the long duration of disease onset and progression. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of altered joint loading on the rotator cuff. Mice were subjected to one of three load-dependent rotator cuff tendinopathy models: underuse loading, achieved by injecting botulinum toxin-A into the supraspinatus muscle; overuse loading, achieved using downhill treadmill running; destabilization loading, achieved by surgical excision of the infraspinatus tendon. All models were compared to cage activity animals. Whole joint function was assessed longitudinally using gait analysis. Tissue-scale structure and function were determined using microCT, tensile testing, and histology. The molecular response of the supraspinatus tendon and enthesis was determined by measuring the expression of 84 wound healing-associated genes. Underuse and destabilization altered forepaw weight-bearing, decreased tendon-to-bone attachment strength, decreased mineral density of the humeral epiphysis, and reduced tendon strength. Transcriptional activity of the underuse group returned to baseline levels by 4 weeks, while destabilization had significant upregulation of inflammation, growth factors, and extracellular matrix remodeling genes. Surprisingly, overuse activity caused changes in walking patterns, increased tendon stiffness, and primarily suppressed expression of wound healing-related genes.

A common way to estimate cellular volume fraction is to image cells in thin, planar histologic sections, and then invoke either the Delesse or the Glagolev principle to estimate the volume fraction from the measured area fraction. The Delesse principle relies upon the observation that for randomly aligned, identical features, the expected value of the observed area fraction of a phase equals the volume fraction of that phase, and the Glagolev principle relies on a similar observation for random rather than planar sampling. These methods are rigorous for analysis of a polished, opaque rock sections and for histologic sections that are thin compared to the characteristic length scale of the cells.

Cx43-deficient mice also exhibited reduced ability to complete a treadmill running protocol but no apparent deficits in daily activity, metabolic indexes, shoulder muscle size, grip strength, and major trabecular bone properties of the adjacent humeral head. To examine enthesis mechanoresponsiveness, young adult mice were subjected to modest treadmill exercise. Gja1 deficiency in the tendon and enthesis reduced entheseal anabolic responses to treadmill exercise: WT mice had increased expression of Sox9, Ihh, and Gli1 and increased Brdu incorporation, whereas Cx43-deficient mice showed no changes or decreased levels with exercise. Collectively, the results demonstrated an essential role for Cx43 in postnatal tendon enthesis formation, function, and response to loading; results further provided evidence implicating a link between Cx43 function and the hedgehog signaling pathway. \u00a9 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["CONNEXIN 43", "ENTHESIS", "GAP JUNCTION", "GLI1", "TENDON"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Connexin 43", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Mice", "Muscles", "Tendons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea G", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Civitelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Bone and Mineral Disease, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "35019292", "Title": "Pulsed Electrical Stimulation Enhances Body Fluid Transport for Collagen Biomineralization.", "Abstract": "Mechanical loads from physiologic activities such as walking and running generate bioelectricity in bones. By mimicking bioelectricity, external electrical stimulations have also been used therapeutically to stimulate bone-forming cells and, thus, to promote bone regeneration. However, little is known about the physicochemical mechanism(s) by which electrical stimulations drives calcium phosphate mineralization of collagen. Here, we showed that, during in vitro collagen mineralization in the absence of cells, application of pulsed electrical stimulation significantly enhanced the transport of ionic body fluid components through a micrometer-scale channel (\u223c100-200 \u03bcm gap space between the inner surfaces of tube-like collagen scaffolds and a cathode placed inside the collagen scaffolds).

Although single-camera techniques excel at estimating deformation on a surface parallel to the imaging plane, they are prone to artifact for 3D motion because they cannot distinguish between out-of-plane motion and in-plane dilatation. Multiview (e.g., stereo) camera systems overcome this via a three-step process consisting of: (1) independent surface registration, (2) triangulation to estimate surface displacements, and (3) deformation estimation. However, existing methods are prone to errors associated with numerical differentiation when computing estimating strain fields from displacement fields unless regularization schemes are used. Such regularization schemes can introduce inaccuracy into strain estimation. Inspired by previous work which combined registration and deformation estimation into a single step for 2D images and 3D imaging stacks, we developed a theory for simultaneous image registration, 3D triangulation, and deformation estimation in a multiview system. The deformation estimation does not require numerical differentiation of displacement fields to estimate strain fields.

At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis (CatK, Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts (Col1, Osc). Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation (Mmp3, Mmp13).

Murine animal models are now widely used to study tendon disorders and evaluate novel treatments for tendinopathies; however, determining the mechanical properties of mouse tendons has been challenging. In this study, a new system was developed for tendon mechanical testing that includes 3D-printed fixtures that exactly match the anatomies of the humerus and calcaneus to mechanically test supraspinatus tendons and Achilles tendons, respectively. These fixtures were developed using 3D reconstructions of native bone anatomy, solid modeling, and additive manufacturing.

For example, nearly all rotator cuff repairs performed on elderly patients with massive tears ultimately result in recurrence of tearing. These high failure rates have been attributed to stress concentrations that arise due to the mechanical mismatch between tendon and bone. Although recent studies have identified potential adhesives with mechanical properties tuned to alleviate these stress concentrations, and thereby delay the onset of failure, resistance to the progression of failure has not been studied. Here, we refined the space of adhesive material properties that can improve surgical attachment by considering the fracture process. Using cohesive zone modelling and physiologically relevant values of mode I and mode II adhesive fracture toughnesses, we predicted the maximum displacement and strength at failure of idealized, adhesively bonded tendon-to-bone repairs. Repair failure occurred due to excessive relative displacement of the tendon and bone tissues for strong and compliant adhesives. The failure mechanism shifted to rupture of the entire repair for stiffer adhesives below a critical shear strength.

However, it is currently unknown whether this response is a reaction to or a driver of pathology. Therefore, we aimed to understand the clinically relevant involvement of the NF-\u03baB pathway in tendinopathy, to determine its potential causative roles in tendon degeneration, and to test its potential as a therapeutic candidate. Transcriptional profiling of early rotator cuff tendinopathy identified increases in NF-\u03baB signaling, including increased expression of the regulatory serine kinase subunit IKK\u03b2, which plays an essential role in inflammation. Using cre-mediated overexpression of IKK\u03b2 in tendon fibroblasts, we observed degeneration of mouse rotator cuff tendons and the adjacent humeral head. These changes were associated with increases in proinflammatory cytokines and innate immune cells within the joint. Conversely, genetic deletion of IKK\u03b2 in tendon fibroblasts partially protected mice from chronic overuse-induced tendinopathy.

Surgical repair of ruptured or lacerated tendons often lead to complications such as adhesions, repair site gapping, and repair site rupture. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have shown promise for enhancing tendon repair, as they have the capacity to differentiate into tendon fibroblasts and augment the healing response. Furthermore, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been shown to promote tendon regeneration via the stimulation of endogenous tendon stem cells. Here, we evaluated the potential of CTGF to promote tenogenic differentiation of ASCs in vitro. Gene and protein expression, cell proliferation, and FAK and ERK1/2 signaling were assessed. CTGF increased tenogenic genes in mouse ASCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Western blot and immunostaining analyses demonstrated increases in tenogenic protein expression in CTGF-treated ASCs at all timepoints studied. CTGF increased ASC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. CTGF induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 within 5\u2009min and FAK within 15\u2009min; both signals persisted for 120\u2009min. Blocking FAK and ERK1/2 pathways by selective inhibitors SCH772984 and PF573228, respectively, attenuated the CTGF-induced tenogenic differentiation and proliferation of ASCs. These results suggest that CTGF induces tenogenic differentiation of ASCs via the FAK and ERK1/2 pathway.

We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21\u202fdays by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk.

To minimize these complications, we sought to reduce the incidence of gapping and to facilitate the initiation of early motion by improving the time zero structural properties of repair. The Winters-Gelberman 8-strand repair technique was modified by adding surface lock loops and by using Fiberwire suture material. Forty-eight canine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were transected and repaired with one of three 8-strand techniques (Pennington modified Kessler, half hitch loops, or surface locking Kessler) using either 3-0 Supramid or 4-0 Fiberwire suture. Biomechanical testing was performed to determine the physiologic and failure mode properties of the repairs. The surface locking Kessler technique improved repair maximum load, load necessary to create a 2 mm repair site gap, and yield force compared to the modified Kessler and half hitch loop techniques. Fiberwire suture improved maximum load, the load necessary to create a 2 mm repair site gap, stiffness, and yield force compared to Supramid suture. Failure occurred by both suture pull out and by suture breakage in the modified Kessler, Supramid suture repair group. Failure occurred consistently by suture breakage in the surface locking Kessler, Supramid suture repair group. These results reveal that a novel locking Kessler repair is significantly stronger than the current state-of-the art flexor tendon suture repair technique.

Although the tissue-level mechanical behavior of collagenous tissues is well understood, the response of collagen at the nanometer length scales to cyclical loading remains elusive. To address this major gap, we cyclically stretched individual reconstituted collagen fibrils, with average diameter of 145\u202f\u00b1\u202f42\u202fnm, to small and large strains in the partially hydrated conditions of 60% relative humidity. It is shown that cyclical loading results in large steady-state hysteresis that is reached immediately after the first loading cycle, followed thereafter by limited accumulation of inelastic strain and constant initial elastic modulus. Cyclic loading above 20% strain resulted in 70% increase in tensile strength, from 638\u202f\u00b1\u202f98\u202fMPa to 1091\u202f\u00b1\u202f110\u202fMPa, and 70% increase in toughness, while maintaining the ultimate tensile strain of collagen fibrils not subjected to cyclic loading. Throughout cyclic stretching, the fibrils maintained a steady-state hysteresis, yielding loss coefficients that are 5-10 times larger than those of known homogeneous materials in their modulus range, thus establishing damping of nanoscale collagen fibrils as a major component of damping in tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: It is shown that steady-state energy dissipation occurs in individual collagen fibrils that are the building blocks of hard and soft tissues. To date, it has been assumed that energy dissipation in tissues takes place mainly at the higher length scales of the tissue hierarchy due to interactions between collagen fibrils and fibers, and in limited extent inside collagen fibrils. It is shown that individual collagen fibrils need only a single loading cycle to assume a highly dissipative, steady-state, cyclic mechanical response. Mechanical cycling at large strains leads to 70% increase in mechanical strength and values exceeding those of engineering steels. The same cyclic loading conditions also lead to 70% increase in toughness and loss properties that are 5-10 times higher than those of engineering materials with comparable stiffness.", "Keywords": ["Energy dissipation", "Hysteresis", "Large deformation", "Recovery", "Strengthening"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cattle", "Elastic Modulus", "Fibrillar Collagens", "Mammals", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Aerospace Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debashish", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Aerospace Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Aerospace Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea G", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 60613, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "Genin", "Affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA; NSF Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "Orthopedic Surgery, Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ioannis", "Last Name": "Chasiotis", "Affiliation": "Aerospace Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "PubDate": "2018Oct15"}, {"PMID": "30106830", "Title": "Enthesis Repair: Challenges and Opportunities for Effective Tendon-to-Bone Healing.", "Abstract": "On May 22, 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) hosted a roundtable on \"Innovative Treatments for Enthesis Repair.\" A summary of the roundtable discussion, as well as a list of the extramural participants, can be found at https://www.niams.nih.gov/about/meetings-events/roundtables/roundtable-innovative-treatments-enthesis-repair.

ASCs were applied to the repair surface via cell sheets and CTGF was delivered to the repair center via porous sutures. The effect of the combined treatment was assessed fourteen days after repair in a canine flexor tendon injury model. CTGF, either alone or with ASCs, reduced inflammatory (IL1B and IL6) and matrix degrading (MMP3 and MMP13) gene expression, while increasing anti-inflammatory gene (IL4) expression and collagen synthesis compared to control repairs. The combined treatment was more effective than CTGF treatment alone, reducing the inflammatory IFNG and scar-associated COL3A1 gene expression and increasing CD146+ tendon stem/progenitor cells at the tendon surface and interior along the core suture tracks.

Calcium phosphate nucleation in collagenous structures follows distinctly different patterns in highly confined gap regions (nanoscale confinement) than in less confined extrafibrillar spaces (microscale confinement). Although the mechanism(s) driving these differences are still largely unknown, differences in the free energy for nucleation may explain these two mineralization behaviors. Here, we report on experimentally obtained nucleation energy barriers to intra- and extrafibrillar mineralization, using in situ X-ray scattering observations and classical nucleation theory. Polyaspartic acid, an extrafibrillar nucleation inhibitor, increases interfacial energies between nuclei and mineralization fluids. In contrast, the confined gap spaces inside collagen fibrils lower the energy barrier by reducing the reactive surface area of nuclei, decreasing the surface energy penalty. The confined gap geometry, therefore, guides the two-dimensional morphology and structure of bioapatite and changes the nucleation pathway by reducing the total energy barrier.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Phosphates", "Cattle", "Fibrillar Collagens", "Minerals", "Models, Molecular", "Peptides", "Protein Conformation", "Scattering, Small Angle", "Thermodynamics", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Doyoon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Byeongdu", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "X-ray Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, 60439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young-Shin", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA. ysjun@seas.wustl.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2018Mar06"}, {"PMID": "29427745", "Title": "Enhanced tendon-to-bone repair through adhesive films.", "Abstract": "Tendon-to-bone surgical repairs have unacceptably high failure rates, possibly due to their inability to recreate the load transfer mechanisms of the native enthesis.

However, these approaches have not achieved consistent functional improvements in large animal trials due to deleterious inflammatory reactions to delivery materials and insufficient induction of targeted biological healing responses. In this study, we achieved porous suture-based sustained delivery of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) into flexor tendons in a clinically relevant canine model. Repairs with CTGF-laden sutures were mechanically competent and did not show any evidence of adhesions or other negative inflammatory reactions based on histology, gene expression, or proteomics analyses at 14 days following repair. CTGF-laden sutures induced local cellular infiltration and a significant biological response immediately adjacent to the suture, including histological signs of angiogenesis and collagen deposition. There were no evident widespread biological effects throughout the tendon substance. There were significant differences in gene expression of the macrophage marker CD163 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL2L1; however, these differences were not corroborated by proteomics analysis. In summary, this study provided encouraging evidence of sustained delivery of biologically active CTGF from porous sutures without signs of a negative inflammatory reaction. With the development of a safe and effective method for generating a positive local biological response, future studies can explore additional methods for enhancing intrasynovial tendon repair. \u00a9 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Interface tissue engineering represents an integrative strategy for regenerating the native enthesis by functionally connecting soft and hard tissues and thereby improving clinical outcome. This review focuses on integrative and cell-instructive scaffold designs that target the healing of the two most commonly injured soft tissue-bone junctions: tendon-bone interface (e.g., rotator cuff) and ligament-bone interface (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament). The inherent connectivity between soft and hard tissues is instrumental for musculoskeletal motion and is therefore a key design criterion for soft tissue regeneration. To this end, scaffold design for soft tissue regeneration have progressed from single tissue systems to the emerging focus on pre-integrated and functional composite tissue units. Specifically, a multifaceted, bioinspired approach has been pursued wherein scaffolds are tailored to stimulate relevant cell responses using spatially patterned structural and chemical cues, growth factors, and/or mechanical stimulation. Moreover, current efforts to elucidate the essential scaffold design criteria via strategic biomimicry are emphasized as these will reduce complexity in composite tissue regeneration and ease the related burden for clinical translation. These innovative studies underscore the clinical relevance of engineering connective tissue integration and have broader impact in the formation of complex tissues and total joint regeneration. \u00a9 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Tensile tests performed at varying angles relative to the dominant fiber direction confirmed that mineral cross-linked PLGA nanofibers without adhering to them. Peel tests revealed that fracture toughness increased with mineralization time up to a peak value, then subsequently decreased with increasing mineralization time back to the baseline toughness of unmineralized scaffolds.

Clinicians often rely on direct measures of rotator cuff tear size and muscle degeneration from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine whether the rotator cuff tear is repairable. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between gene expression changes in rotator cuff muscle degeneration to standard data available to clinicians. Radiographic assessment of preoperative rotator cuff tear severity was completed for 25 patients with varying magnitudes of rotator cuff tears. Tear width and retraction were measured using MRI, and Goutallier grade, tangent (tan) sign, and Thomazeau grade were determined. Expression of myogenic-, adipogenic-, atrophy-, and metabolism-related genes in biopsied muscles were correlated with tear width, tear retraction, Goutallier grade, tan sign, and Thomazeau grade. Tear width positively correlated with Goutallier grade in both the supraspinatus (r\u2009=\u20090.73) and infraspinatus (r\u2009=\u20090.77), along with tan sign (r\u2009=\u20090.71) and Thomazeau grade (r\u2009=\u20090.68). Decreased myogenesis (Myf5), increased adipogenesis (CEBP\u03b1, Lep, Wnt10b), and decreased metabolism (PPAR\u03b1) correlated with radiographic assessments. Gene expression changes suggest that rotator cuff tears lead to a dramatic molecular response in an attempt to maintain normal muscle tissue, increase adipogenesis, and decrease metabolism. Fat accumulation and muscle atrophy appear to stem from endogenous changes rather than from changes mediated by infiltrating cells. Results suggest that chronic unloading of muscle, induced by rotator cuff tear, disrupts muscle homeostasis. \u00a9 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A high compliance zone near the mineralized gradient of the attachment was clearly identified and highlighted the lack of correlation between mineral distribution and strain on the low-mineral end of the attachment.

In this study, the influence of imbalanced muscular loading on joint development was studied using localized chemical denervation of hip stabilizing muscle groups in neonatal mice. It was hypothesized that imbalanced muscle loading, targeting either gluteal muscles or quadriceps muscles, would lead to bilateral hip joint asymmetry, as measured by acetabular coverage, femoral head volume and bone morphometry, and femoral-acetabular shape. The contralateral hip joints as well as age-matched, uninjected mice were used as controls. Altered bone development was analyzed using micro-computed tomography, histology, and image registration techniques at postnatal days (P) 28, 56, and 120. This study found that unilateral muscle unloading led to reduced acetabular coverage of the femoral head, lower total volume, lower bone volume ratio, and lower mineral density, at all three time points. Histologically, the femoral head was smaller in unloaded hips, with thinner triradiate cartilage at P28 and thinner cortical bone at P120 compared to contralateral hips. Morphological shape changes were evident in unloaded hips at P56. Unloaded hips had lower trabecular thickness and increased trabecular spacing of the femoral head compared to contralateral hips. The present study suggests that decreased muscle loading of the hip leads to altered bone and joint shape and growth during postnatal maturation.

The best estimate available for a composite containing multiple classes of inclusions arises from the Kanaun-Jeulin approach.

Here, we present an estimate for composites containing multiple classes of aligned ellipsoidal inclusions that lies within known three-point bounds at relatively higher volume fractions of inclusions and that is applicable to many engineering and biological composites.", "Keywords": ["Tendon-to-bone insertion site", "composite materials", "enthesis", "homogenization methods"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Saadat", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Birman", "Affiliation": "Engineering Education Center, Missouri University of Science and Technology, St. Louis, MO 63131, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "Genin", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the mechanics and physics of solids", "PubDate": "2015Sep01"}, {"PMID": "26855755", "Title": "Tunability of collagen matrix mechanical properties via multiple modes of mineralization.", "Abstract": "Functionally graded, mineralized collagen tissues exist at soft-to-hard material attachments throughout the body.

In this study, spatial control of mineralization was achieved in collagen matrices using simulated body fluids (SBFs). Based upon previous observations of poor bonding between reconstituted collagen and HA deposited using SBF, we hypothesized that mineralizing collagen in the presence of fetuin (which inhibits surface mineralization) would lead to more mineral deposition within the scaffold and therefore a greater increase in stiffness and toughness compared with collagen mineralized without fetuin. We tested this hypothesis through integrated synthesis, mechanical testing and modelling of graded, mineralized reconstituted collagen constructs. Results supported the hypothesis, and further suggested that mineralization on the interior of reconstituted collagen constructs, as promoted by fetuin, led to superior bonding between HA and collagen.

However, model identification is challenging because the Fung QLV model's 'box'-shaped relaxation spectrum, predominant in biomechanics applications, can provide an excellent fit even when it is not a reasonable representation of a material's relaxation spectrum. Here, we present a robust and simple discrete approach for identifying a material's temporal relaxation spectrum from stress-relaxation data in an unbiased way. Our 'discrete QLV' (DQLV) approach identifies ranges of time constants over which the Fung QLV model's typical box spectrum provides an accurate representation of a particular material's temporal relaxation spectrum, and is effective at providing a fit to this model. The DQLV spectrum also reveals when other forms or discrete time constants are more suitable than a box spectrum.

Tears are typically repaired by suturing the tendon back to its bony attachment. Unfortunately, the structural (e.g., aligned collagen) and compositional (e.g., a gradient in mineral) elements that produce a robust attachment in the healthy tissue are not regenerated during healing, and the repair is prone to failure. Two features of the failed healing response are deposition of poorly aligned scar tissue and loss of bone at the repair site. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to improve tendon-to-bone healing by promoting aligned collagen deposition and increased bone formation using a biomimetic scaffold seeded with pluripotent cells. An aligned nanofibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold with a gradient in mineral content was seeded with adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and implanted at the repair site of a rat rotator cuff model. In one group, cells were transduced with the osteogenic factor bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). The healing response was examined in four groups (suture only, acellular scaffold, cellular scaffold, and cellular BMP2 scaffold) using histologic, bone morphology, and biomechanical outcomes at 14, 28, and 56 days. Histologically, the healing interface was dominated by a fibrovascular scar response in all groups. The acellular scaffold group showed a delayed healing response compared to the other groups. When examining bone morphology parameters, bone loss was evident in the cellular BMP2 group compared to other groups at 28 days. When examining repair-site mechanical properties, strength and modulus were decreased in the cellular BMP2 groups compared to other groups at 28 and 56 days. These results indicated that tendon-to-bone healing in this animal model was dominated by scar formation, preventing any positive effects of the implanted biomimetic scaffold. Furthermore, cells transduced with the osteogenic factor BMP2 led to impaired healing, suggesting that this growth factor should not be used in the tendon-to-bone repair setting.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Bone-Implant Interface", "Cells, Cultured", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Guided Tissue Regeneration", "Male", "Materials Testing", "Nanofibers", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stem Cells", "Tendon Injuries", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Lipner", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis , St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis , St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Leonardo", "Last Name": "Cavinatto", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis , St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Wenying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "3 School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta, Georgia ."}, {"First Name": "Necat", "Last Name": "Havlioglu", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Pathology, John Cochran VA Medical Center , St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Younan", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "5 The Wallace H.

The mechanical properties of suitable adhesives were identified using a shear lag model. Examination of the design space for an optimal adhesive demonstrated requirements for strong adhesion and low stiffness to maximize the strength of the adhesive-coated suture repair construct. To experimentally assess the model, we evaluated single strands of sutures coated with highly flexible cyanoacrylates (Loctite 4903 and 4902), cyanoacrylate (Loctite QuickTite Instant Adhesive Gel), rubber cement, rubber/gasket adhesive (1300 Scotch-Weld Neoprene High Performance Rubber & Gasket Adhesive), an albumin-glutaraldehyde adhesive (BioGlue), or poly(dopamine). As a clinically relevant proof-of-concept, cyanoacrylate-coated sutures were then used to perform a clinically relevant flexor digitorum tendon repair in cadaver tissue. The repair performed with adhesive-coated suture had significantly higher strength compared to the standard repair without adhesive. Notably, cyanoacrylate provides strong adhesion with high stiffness and brittle behavior, and is therefore not an ideal adhesive for enhancing suture repair.

This tissue modulates the transfer of muscle forces between two materials, i.e. tendon and bone, with vastly different mechanical properties. The enthesis for many tendons consists of a mineralized graded fibrocartilage that develops postnatally, concurrent with epiphyseal mineralization. Although it is well described that the mineralization and development of functional maturity requires muscle loading, the biological factors that modulate enthesis development are poorly understood. By genetically demarcating cells expressing Gli1 in response to Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, we discovered a unique population of Hh-responsive cells in the developing murine enthesis that were distinct from tendon fibroblasts and epiphyseal chondrocytes. Lineage-tracing experiments revealed that the Gli1 lineage cells that originate in utero eventually populate the entire mature enthesis. Muscle paralysis increased the number of Hh-responsive cells in the enthesis, demonstrating that responsiveness to Hh is modulated in part by muscle loading. Ablation of the Hh-responsive cells during the first week of postnatal development resulted in a loss of mineralized fibrocartilage, with very little tissue remodeling 5 weeks after cell ablation. Conditional deletion of smoothened, a molecule necessary for responsiveness to Ihh, from the developing tendon and enthesis altered the differentiation of enthesis progenitor cells, resulting in significantly reduced fibrocartilage mineralization and decreased biomechanical function.

Recent work has also suggested that bone acts as an endocrine organ that can influence the development of other organs. Connexin43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein that transduces mechanical signals, is an important determinant of cortical bone modeling. Using an osteoblast/osteocyte-specific ablation of the Cx43 gene (Gja1) driven by the 2.3-kb Col1 \u03b11 promoter (cKO) in the mouse, in this study we confirmed reduced cortical bone thickness and density with expanded bone marrow cavity in the cKO humerus. Surprisingly, Gja1 deletion in bone cells also affected skeletal muscle development, resulting in lower fast muscle weight, grip strength, and maximum absolute and specific tetanic forces (60% to 80%, 85%, and 50%, respectively, of WT mice). The normally fast twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle exhibited increased slow twitch fibers in cKO mice. These muscle defects were accompanied by a 40% to 60% reduction in mRNA abundance for genes encoding osteocalcin in the humerus, relative to WT mice. Accordingly, both carboxylated and undercarboxylated isoforms of osteocalcin were reduced by over 30% in the circulation of cKO mice. Moreover, the active, undercarboxylated isoform of osteocalcin (glu-OC) promoted myotube formation in C2C12 myoblast cultures, and glu-OC injections to cKO mice rescued EDL muscle cross-sectional area and grip strength in vivo. These findings demonstrate that Cx43 in osteoblasts/osteocytes indirectly modulates skeletal muscle growth and function, potentially via an endocrine effect of glu-OC.", "Keywords": ["BONE-MUSCLE INTERACTIONS", "CONNEXIN43", "GAP JUNCTION", "OSTEOCALCIN"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Connexin 43", "Energy Metabolism", "Gene Deletion", "Homeostasis", "Insulin", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Osteoblasts", "Osteocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Grimston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Civitelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25165601", "Title": "Simple and accurate methods for quantifying deformation, disruption, and development in biological tissues.", "Abstract": "When mechanical factors underlie growth, development, disease or healing, they often function through local regions of tissue where deformation is highly concentrated.

The strain estimation technique improves accuracy relative to other state-of-the-art algorithms by directly estimating strain fields without first estimating displacements, resulting in a very simple method and low computational cost. The technique for identifying local elevation of strain enables for the first time the successful identification of the onset and consequences of local strain concentrating features such as cracks and tears in a highly strained tissue.

Removal of loads leads to malformed bones and impaired musculoskeletal function due to changes in bone (re)modeling. In the current study, the development of a mineralized junction at the interface between muscle and bone was examined under normal and impaired loading conditions. Unilateral mouse rotator cuff muscles were paralyzed using botulinum toxin A at birth. Control groups consisted of contralateral shoulders injected with saline and a separate group of normal mice. It was hypothesized that muscle unloading would suppress bone formation and enhance bone resorption at the enthesis, and that the unloading-induced bony defects could be rescued by suppressing osteoclast activity. In order to modulate osteoclast activity, mice were injected with the bisphosphonate alendronate. Bone formation was measured at the tendon enthesis using alizarin and calcein fluorescent labeling of bone surfaces followed by quantitative histomorphometry of histologic sections. Bone volume and architecture was measured using micro computed tomography. Osteoclast surface was determined via quantitative histomorphometry of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase stained histologic sections. Muscle unloading resulted in delayed initiation of endochondral ossification at the enthesis, but did not impair bone formation rate. Unloading led to severe defects in bone volume and trabecular bone architecture. These defects were partially rescued by suppression of osteoclast activity through alendronate treatment, and the effect of alendronate was dose dependent. Similarly, bone formation rate was increased with increasing alendronate dose across loading groups. The bony defects caused by unloading were therefore likely due to maintained high osteoclast activity, which normally decreases from neonatal through mature timepoints.

This unique tissue cannot be reconstructed following injury, leading to high incidence of recurrent failure and stressing the need for new clinical approaches. This review describes the current understanding of the development and function of the attachment site between tendon and bone. The embryonic attachment unit, namely, the tip of the tendon and the bone eminence into which it is inserted, was recently shown to develop modularly from a unique population of Sox9- and Scx-positive cells, which are distinct from tendon fibroblasts and chondrocytes. The fate and differentiation of these cells is regulated by transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, respectively. Muscle loads are then necessary for the tissue to mature and mineralize. Mineralization of the attachment unit, which occurs postnatally at most sites, is largely controlled by an Indian hedgehog/parathyroid hormone-related protein feedback loop. A number of fundamental questions regarding the development of this remarkable attachment system require further study.

Previous attempts to improve tendon healing have focused on the later stages of healing (i.e., proliferation and matrix synthesis). The early inflammatory phase of tendon healing, however, is not fully understood and its modulation during healing has not yet been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to characterize the early inflammatory phase of flexor tendon healing with the goal of identifying inflammation-related targets for future treatments. Canine flexor tendons were transected and repaired using techniques identical to those used clinically. The inflammatory response was monitored for 9 days. Temporal changes in immune cell populations and gene expression of inflammation-, matrix degradation-, and extracellular matrix-related factors were examined. Gene expression patterns paralleled changes in repair-site cell populations. Of the observed changes, the most dramatic effect was a greater than 4,000-fold up-regulation in the expression of the pro-inflammatory factor IL-1\u03b2. While an inflammatory response is likely necessary for healing to occur, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may result in collateral tissue damage and impaired tendon healing.

The disparate mechanical properties of the two tissues make it difficult to achieve direct surgical repair of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Healing after surgical repair typically does not regenerate the natural attachment, a complex tissue that connects tendon and bone across a gradient in both mineral content and cell phenotypes. To facilitate the regeneration of the attachment, our groups have developed a nanofiber-based scaffold with a graded mineral coating to mimic the mineral composition of the native tendon-to-bone insertion. In the present work, we evaluated the ability of this scaffold to induce graded osteogenesis of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Results from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining indicated that cell proliferation was negatively correlated with the mineral content. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase staining, an indicator of osteogenesis, was positively correlated with the mineral content. Likewise, runt-related transcription factor 2 (an early marker of osteoblast differentiation) and osteocalcin (a late marker of osteoblast differentiation) immunostaining were both positively correlated with the mineral content.

However, in a developing neonatal mouse, the mineralization of soft tissues progresses despite greatly reduced average mechanical stresses. In adults, these reduced loads would likely lead to bone loss. Although biochemical factors may partly explain these different responses, it is unclear how mineralization is initiated in low load environments. We present here the effect of morphometric data and initial modeling supporting a hypothesis that mechanical factors across several length scales amplify stresses, and we suggest that these stresses are of a level adequate to contribute to mechanical signaling for initiation of mineralization at the developing tendon-to-bone enthesis. A mineral gradient is evident across the insertion from the onset of mineralization. This grading maintains a constant size from early postnatal time points to adulthood. At the tissue level, this grading contributes to reduced stresses in an adult animal and to a minor elevation of stresses in a neonatal animal. At the cellular level, stress concentrations around mineralizing chondrocytes are enhanced in neonatal animals compared with adult animals. The enhancement of stresses around cells at early time points may serve to amplify and transduce low loads in order to initiate mineralization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Bone and Bones", "Cell Size", "Humeral Head", "Mice", "Minerals", "Models, Biological", "Muscles", "Stress, Mechanical", "Tendons", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanxin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea G", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Birman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Thomopoulos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "Genin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "PubDate": "2014Oct"}, {"PMID": "24352669", "Title": "Modelling the mechanics of partially mineralized collagen fibrils, fibres and tissue.", "Abstract": "Progressive stiffening of collagen tissue by bioapatite mineral is important physiologically, but the details of this stiffening are uncertain. Unresolved questions about the details of the accommodation of bioapatite within and upon collagen's hierarchical structure have posed a central hurdle, but recent microscopy data resolve several major questions. These data suggest how collagen accommodates bioapatite at the lowest relevant hierarchical level (collagen fibrils), and suggest several possibilities for the progressive accommodation of bioapatite at higher hierarchical length scales (fibres and tissue). We developed approximations for the stiffening of collagen across spatial hierarchies based upon these data, and connected models across hierarchies levels to estimate mineralization-dependent tissue-level mechanics. In the five possible sequences of mineralization studied, percolation of the bioapatite phase proved to be an important determinant of the degree of stiffening by bioapatite. The models were applied to study one important instance of partially mineralized tissue, which occurs at the attachment of tendon to bone. All sequences of mineralization considered reproduced experimental observations of a region of tissue between tendon and bone that is more compliant than either tendon or bone, but the size and nature of this region depended strongly upon the sequence of mineralization.

They are abundant in adults, easy to access, and are therefore an ideal cell source for tendon tissue engineering. Despite this potential, the molecular cues necessary for tenogenic differentiation of ASCs are unknown. Unlike other bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), BMP12, BMP13, and BMP14 have been reported to be less osteo-chondrogenic and to induce tendon rather than bone formation in vivo. This study investigated the effects of BMP12 and BMP14 on ASC differentiation in vitro. In canine ASCs, BMP12 effectively increased the expression of the tendon markers scleraxis and tenomodulin at both mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with these results, BMP12 induced scleraxis promoter driven-GFP and tenomodulin protein expression in mouse ASCs. Although BMP12 also enhanced the expression of the cartilage matrix gene aggrecan in ASCs, the resulting levels remained considerably lower than those detected in tendon fibroblasts. In addition, BMP12 reduced expression of the bone marker osteocalcin, but not the osteogenic transcription factor runx-2. BMP14 exhibited similar, but marginally less potent and selective effects, compared to BMP12. BMPs are known to signal through the canonical Smad pathway and the non-canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. BMP12 triggered robust phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 but not Smad2/3 or p38 MAPK in ASCs. The effect was likely conveyed by type I receptors ALK2/3/6, as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 was blocked by the ALK2/3/6 inhibitor LDN-193189 but not by the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB-505124. Moreover, ALK6 was found to be the most abundant type I receptor in ASCs, with mRNA expression 100 to 10,000 times that of any other type I receptor.
