Loss or disruption of the blood pressure circadian rhythm has been linked to adverse health outcomes, for example, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. However, the current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches lack sufficient attention to the circadian rhythmicity of blood pressure. Sleep patterns, hormone release, eating habits, digestion, body temperature, renal and cardiovascular function, and other important host functions as well as gut microbiota exhibit circadian rhythms, and influence circadian rhythms of blood pressure. Potential benefits of nonpharmacologic interventions such as meal timing, and pharmacologic chronotherapeutic interventions, such as the bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications, have recently been suggested in some studies. However, the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm-mediated blood pressure regulation and the efficacy of chronotherapy in hypertension remain unclear.

review summarizes recent literature addressing the association of short sleep duration, shift work, and obstructive sleep apnea with hypertension risk, blood pressure (BP) levels, and 24-hour ambulatory BP. Observational studies demonstrate that subjectively assessed short sleep increases hypertension risk, though conflicting results are observed in studies of objectively assessed short sleep. Intervention studies demonstrate that mild and severe sleep restriction are associated with higher BP. Rotating and night shift work are associated with hypertension as shift work may exacerbate the detrimental impact of short sleep on BP. Further, studies demonstrate that shift work may increase nighttime BP and reduce BP control in patients with hypertension. Finally, moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, particularly resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea is also associated with abnormal 24-hour ambulatory BP profiles, including higher daytime and nighttime BP, nondipping BP, and a higher morning surge. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment may lower BP and improve BP dipping. In conclusion, efforts should be made to educate patients and health care providers about the importance of identifying and treating sleep disturbances for hypertension prevention and management. Empirically supported sleep health interventions represent a critical next step to advance this research area and establish causality.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "health behavior",

Likelihood of OSA was determined using the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Global sleep quality, habitual sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and midsleep time were obtained from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Nocturnal hypertension was defined as mean asleep SBP \u2265120\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or diastolic BP \u226570\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Nondipping SBP was defined as a decline in awake-to-asleep SBP <10%. Among 702 participants, the prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP was 41.3% and 32.5%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment including cardiovascular risk factors, the prevalence ratios (PRs) for nocturnal hypertension and nondipping SBP associated with high versus low likelihood of OSA were 1.32 (95% CI, 1.00-1.75) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02-1.68), respectively.

We examined the association between perceived stress levels assessed annually for up to 13\u00a0years and incident hypertension in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based cohort of blacks. Methods and Results Analyses included 1829 participants without hypertension at baseline (Exam 1, 2000-2004). Incident hypertension was defined as blood pressure\u2265140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or antihypertensive medication use at Exam 2 (2005-2008) or Exam 3 (2009-2012). Each follow-up interval at risk of hypertension was categorized as low, moderate, or high perceived stress based on the number of annual assessments between exams in which participants reported \"a lot\" or \"extreme\" stress over the previous year (low, 0 high stress ratings; moderate, 1 high stress rating; high, \u22652 high stress ratings). During follow-up (median, 7.0\u00a0years), hypertension incidence was 48.5%. Hypertension developed in 30.6% of intervals with low perceived stress, 34.6% of intervals with moderate perceived stress, and 38.2% of intervals with high perceived stress. Age-, sex-, and time-adjusted risk ratios (95% CI) associated with moderate and high perceived stress versus low perceived stress were 1.19 (1.04-1.37) and 1.37 (1.20-1.57), respectively (P trend<0.001). The association was present after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and baseline stress (P trend=0.001).

Many individuals without LVH have a left ventricular mass that exceeds the level predicted by their sex, body size, and cardiac workload, a condition called inappropriate left ventricular mass (iLVM). We investigated the association of iLVM with CVD events and all-cause mortality among blacks. Methods and Results We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based cohort of blacks. The current analysis included 4424 participants without CVD and with an echocardiogram at baseline. Among this cohort, the prevalence of iLVM was 13.8%. There were 262 CVD events and 419 deaths over a median follow-up of 9.7\u00a0years (maximum, 12\u00a0years). Compared with participants without iLVM, participants with iLVM had a higher rate of CVD events and all-cause mortality. After multivariable adjustment, including for the presence of LVH, iLVM was associated with an increased risk of CVD events (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.62). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.98-1.70). Among participants without and with LVH, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of iLVM for CVD events were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.68-3.81) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.74-2.00), respectively (Pinteraction=0.029); and for all-cause mortality, the hazard ratios were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.81-1.89) and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.86-1.85), respectively (Pinteraction=0.664).

We conducted an open-label, parallel-arm, non-randomized, matched before-after study in individuals with OSA who were starting CPAP use (n = 12) and who were not (n = 12) to examine the effects of CPAP on total body composition (via air displacement plethysmography) including fat and fat-free mass. CPAP users (n = 12) were studied at baseline and after 8 weeks of CPAP use, and 12 age- and sex-matched non-CPAP OSA controls were studied at baseline and after an 8 week period. Statistically significant group x time interactions were seen for body weight, fat-free mass, and fat-mass, such that body weight and fat-free mass were increased, and fat mass decreased, at 8-week follow-up in the CPAP group compared to baseline. Body weight and body composition measures were unchanged in the non-CPAP control group. These findings are consistent with prior studies showing CPAP-induced weight gain, and suggest that weight gain observed following CPAP may be driven primarily by increases in fat-free mass.

We used sickle cell trait ( SCT ) and \u03b1+thalassemia, genetic variants conferring partial protection against malaria, as tools to test this hypothesis. Methods and Results Study sites were Kilifi, Kenya, which has malaria transmission, and Nairobi, Kenya, and Jackson, Mississippi, where there is no malaria transmission. The primary outcome was 24-hour systolic BP. Prevalent hypertension, diagnosed using European Society of Hypertension thresholds was a secondary outcome. We performed regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We studied 1127 participants in Kilifi, 516 in Nairobi, and 651 in Jackson. SCT frequency was 21% in Kilifi, 16% in Nairobi, and 9% in Jackson. SCT was associated with -2.4 (95% CI , -4.7 to -0.2) mm\u00a0Hg lower 24-hour systolic BP in Kilifi but had no effect in Nairobi/Jackson. The effect of SCT in Kilifi was limited to 30- to 59-year-old participants, among whom it was associated with -6.1\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg ( CI , -10.5 to -1.8) lower 24-hour systolic BP. In pooled analysis allowing interaction by site, the effect of SCT on 24-hour systolic BP in Kilifi was -3.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg ( CI , -6.9 to -0.1), increasing to -5.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg ( CI , -9.5 to -0.9) when replacing estimated glomerular filtration rate with urine albumin to creatinine ratio as a covariate. In Kilifi, the prevalence ratio for hypertension was 0.86 ( CI , 0.76-0.98) for SCT and 0.89 ( CI , 0.80-0.99) for \u03b1+thalassemia.

Invasive coronary revascularization procedures are commonly used to reduce secondary ACS risk and may reduce patients' EST, as revascularized patients often report being \"cured.\" We assessed ACS patients' initial threat perceptions during emergency department (ED) evaluation and followed them for 1 month for PTSD symptoms (specific for ACS, by telephone). We compared PTSD symptoms in participants who were revascularized (n = 65), catheterized but not revascularized (n = 35), and medically managed (n = 43).

Although the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute increased funding of career development grants, only a small number of early-career American College of Cardiology members have benefited as funding of the entire cohort has decreased. Personal\u00a0motivation, institutional support, and collaborators continued to be positive influential factors. Surprisingly, mentoring ceased to correlate positively with obtaining external grants. The totality of findings suggests that the\u00a0status of early-career academic cardiologists remains challenging; therefore, the authors recommend a set of\u00a0attainable solutions.", "Keywords": ["cardiology profession", "clinician-scientist", "early-career academic cardiologist", "mentoring", "physician-scientist"], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiologists", "Cardiology", "Career Choice", "Humans", "Mentors", "Research Support as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carl W", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physiology, Texas A&M University College of Medicine and Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology-Temple Region, Baylor Scott & White Health, Temple, Texas.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of physical activity with incident hypertension among African Americans. We studied 1311 participants without hypertension at baseline enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based study of African Americans residing in Jackson, Mississippi. Overall physical activity, moderate-vigorous physical activity, and domain-specific physical activity (work, active living, household, and sport/exercise) were assessed by self-report during the baseline examination (2000-2004). Incident hypertension, assessed at examination 2 (2005-2008) and examination 3 (2009-2013), was defined as the first visit with systolic/diastolic blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm\u2009Hg or self-reported antihypertensive medication use. Over a median follow-up of 8.0 years, there were 650 (49.6%) incident hypertension cases. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for incident hypertension comparing participants with intermediate and ideal versus poor levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity were 0.84 (0.67-1.05) and 0.76 (0.58-0.99), respectively (P trend=0.038). A graded, dose-response association was also present for sport/exercise-related physical activity (Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 versus Quartile 1: 0.92 [0.68-1.25], 0.87 [0.67-1.13], 0.75 [0.58-0.97], respectively; P trend=0.032). There were no statistically significant associations observed for overall physical activity, or work, active living, and household-related physical activities.

Because of improved outcomes in both congenital and adult transplant recipients, the number of male and female patients of childbearing age who desire pregnancy has also increased within this population. While there have been many successful pregnancies in post-cardiac transplant patients reported in the literature, long-term outcome data is limited. Decisions regarding the optimal timing and management of pregnancy in male and female post-cardiac transplant patients are challenging and should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers. Pregnant patients will need to be counseled and monitored carefully for complications including rejection, graft dysfunction, and infection. This review focuses on preconception counseling for both male and female cardiac transplant recipients. The maternal and fetal risks during pregnancy and the postpartum period, including risks to the fetus fathered by a male cardiac transplant recipient will be reviewed. It also provides a brief summary of our own transplant experience and recommendations for overall management of pregnancy in the post-cardiac transplant recipient.", "Keywords": ["heart transplant", "pregnancy"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Breast Feeding", "Decision Making", "Directive Counseling", "Female", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Pregnancy, High-Risk", "Prognosis", "Survivors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marwah", "Last Name": "Abdalla", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Donna M", "Last Name": "Mancini", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.
