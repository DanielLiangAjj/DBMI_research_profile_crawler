The predictive mechanisms used by the cerebellum cover not only sensorimotor functions but also reward-related tasks. Cerebellar circuits appear to encode temporal difference error and reward prediction error. From a chemical standpoint, cerebellar catecholamines modulate the rate of cerebellar-based cognitive learning, and mediate cerebellar contributions during complex behaviours. Reward processing and its associated emotions are tuned by the cerebellum which operates as a controller of adaptive homeostatic processes based on interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs. Lobules VI-VII/areas of the vermis are candidate regions for the cortico-subcortical signaling pathways associated with loss aversion and reward sensitivity, together with other nodes of the limbic circuitry. There is growing evidence that the cerebellum works as a hub of regional dysconnectivity across all mood states and that mental disorders involve the cerebellar circuitry, including mood and addiction disorders, and impaired eating behaviors where the cerebellum might be involved in longer time scales of prediction as compared to motor operations. Cerebellar patients exhibit aberrant social behaviour, showing aberrant impulsivity/compulsivity. The cerebellum is a master-piece of reward mechanisms, together with the striatum, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Critically, studies on reward processing reinforce our view that a fundamental role of the cerebellum is to construct internal models, perform predictions on the impact of future behaviour and compare what is predicted and what actually occurs.", "Keywords": ["Addiction", "Ataxias", "Catecholamines", "Cerebellum", "Emotions", "Mood", "Predictions", "Reward", "Social interactions"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Manto", "Affiliation": "Service de Neurologie, M\u00e9diath\u00e8que Jean Jacquy, CHU-Charleroi, 6000, Charleroi, Belgium. mario.manto@ulb.be."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Adamaszek", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Cognitive Neurorehabilitation, Klinik Bavaria Kreischa, 01731, Kreischa, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Apps", "Affiliation": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Carlson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98108, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Guarque-Chabrera", "Affiliation": "\u00c1rea de Psicobiolog\u00eda, Facultat de Ci\u00e8ncies de La Salut, Universitat Jaume I, 12071, Castell\u00f3n de La Plana, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Elien", "Last Name": "Heleven", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Psychology and Center for Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1050, Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Shinji", "Last Name": "Kakei", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Jissen Women's University, Tokyo, 191-8510, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kamran", "Last Name": "Khodakhah", "Affiliation": "Dominick Purpura Department of Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Ying R", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Center, Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, 77030 TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mati", "Last Name": "Joshua", "Affiliation": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Miquel", "Affiliation": "\u00c1rea de Psicobiolog\u00eda, Facultat de Ci\u00e8ncies de La Salut, Universitat Jaume I, 12071, Castell\u00f3n de La Plana, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Mitoma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Education, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Noga", "Last Name": "Larry", "Affiliation": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Julie Anne", "Last Name": "P\u00e9ron", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology Laboratory, Department of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Geneva, 1205, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Jasmine", "Last Name": "Pickford", "Affiliation": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dennis J L G", "Last Name": "Schutter", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Helmholtz Institute, Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 1, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Manpreet K", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis, 2230 Stockton Blvd, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tommy", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75235, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hirokazu", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Information Technology, Tokyo City University, Tokyo, 158-8557, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75235, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Van Overwalle", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Psychology and Center for Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1050, Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Kunihiko", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75235, USA."}], "Journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "PubDate": "2024May20"}, {"PMID": "38765931", "Title": "Validation of a New Patient-Reported Outcome Measure of the Functional Impact of Essential Tremor on Activities of Daily Living.", "Abstract": "The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) is a popular scale for essential tremor (ET), but its activities of daily living (ADL) and performance (P) subscales are based on a structured interview and physical exam.

Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, and simultaneous motion tracking in the Grid2dupE3 mouse model to investigate whether and how neuronal activity in the olivocerebellum determines the frequency of essential tremor. We report that tremor frequency was encoded by the temporal coherence of population neuronal firing within the olivocerebellums of these mice, leading to frequency-dependent cerebellar oscillations and tremors. This mechanism was precise and generalizable, enabling us to use optogenetic stimulation of the deep cerebellar nuclei to induce frequency-specific tremors in wild-type mice or alter tremor frequencies in tremor mice. In patients with ET, we showed that deep brain stimulation of the thalamus suppressed tremor symptoms but did not eliminate cerebellar oscillations measured by electroencephalgraphy, indicating that tremor-related oscillations in the cerebellum do not require the reciprocal interactions with the thalamus. Frequency-disrupting transcranial alternating current stimulation of the cerebellum could suppress tremor amplitudes, confirming the frequency modulatory role of the cerebellum in patients with ET.

We performed a survey of biological and social factors in SCA6 patients enrolled in the SCA6 Network at the University of Chicago. AAO of ataxia symptoms and patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of ataxia were used as primary outcome measures.

In this study, we identified 553 patients carrying biallelic RFC1 expansions and measured the repeat expansion size in 392 cases. Pearson's coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between the repeat size and age at disease onset. A Cox model with robust cluster standard errors was adopted to describe the effect of repeat size on age at disease onset, on age at onset of each individual symptoms, and on disease progression. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to analyse the relationship between phenotype and repeat size. We performed multivariate linear regression to assess the association of the repeat size with the degree of cerebellar atrophy. Meiotic stability was assessed by Southern blotting on first-degree relatives of 27 probands. Finally, somatic instability was investigated by optical genome mapping on cerebellar and frontal cortex and unaffected peripheral tissue from four post-mortem cases. A larger repeat size of both smaller and larger allele was associated with an earlier age at neurological onset [smaller allele hazard ratio (HR) = 2.06, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.53, P < 0.001] and with a higher hazard of developing disabling symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia (smaller allele HR = 3.40, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.71, P = 0.002) or loss of independent walking (smaller allele HR = 2.78, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.60; P < 0.001) earlier in disease course.

We compared total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was unknown.

Yet, evidence for the role of the cerebellum in reward learning in humans is lacking. Moreover, open questions remain about which specific aspects of reward learning the cerebellum may contribute to. Here we address this gap through an investigation of multiple forms of reward learning in individuals with cerebellum dysfunction, represented by cerebellar ataxia cases. Nineteen participants with cerebellar ataxia and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed two separate tasks that required learning about reward contingencies from trial-and-error. To probe the selectivity of reward learning processes, the tasks differed in their underlying structure: while one task measured incremental reward learning ability alone, the other allowed participants to use an alternative learning strategy based on episodic memory alongside incremental reward learning. We found that individuals with cerebellar ataxia were profoundly impaired at reward learning from trial-and-error feedback on both tasks, but retained the ability to learn to predict reward based on episodic memory. These findings provide evidence from humans for a specific and necessary role for the cerebellum in incremental learning of reward associations based on reinforcement.

Recent research shows that sensorimotor cough dysfunction is associated with airway invasion and dysphagia in other neurological conditions and may increase the risk of pneumonia. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize sensorimotor cough function and its relationship with ataxia severity. Thirty-seven participants with cerebellar ataxia completed voluntary and/or reflex cough testing. Ataxia severity was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Linear multilevel models revealed voluntary cough peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) estimates of 2.61\u00a0L/s and cough expired volume (CEV) estimates of 0.52\u00a0L. Reflex PEFR (1.82\u00a0L/s) and CEV (0.34\u00a0L) estimates were lower than voluntary PEFR and CEV estimates. Variability was higher for reflex PEFR (15.74% coefficient of variation [CoV]) than voluntary PEFR (12.13% CoV). 46% of participants generated at least two, two-cough responses following presentations of reflex cough stimuli. There was a small inverse relationship between ataxia severity and voluntary PEFR (\u03b2 = -0.05, 95% CI: -0.09 - -0.01\u00a0L) and ataxia severity and voluntary CEV (\u03b2 = -0.01, 95% CI: -0.02 - -0.004\u00a0L/s).

Clinically, patients exhibit various combinations of a vestibulocerebellar syndrome, a cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome and a cerebellar motor syndrome which will be discussed throughout this chapter. Cerebellar patients show abnormal Bereitschaftpotentials (BPs) and mismatch negativity. Cerebellar EEG is now being applied in cerebellar disorders to unravel impaired electrophysiological patterns associated within disorders of the cerebellar cortex. Eyeblink conditioning is significantly impaired in cerebellar disorders: the ability to acquire conditioned eyeblink responses is reduced in hereditary ataxias, in cerebellar stroke and after tumor surgery of the cerebellum. Furthermore, impaired eyeblink conditioning is an early marker of cerebellar degenerative disease. General rules of motor control suggest that optimal strategies are needed to execute voluntary movements in the complex environment of daily life. A high degree of adaptability is required for learning procedures underlying motor control as sensorimotor adaptation is essential to perform accurate goal-directed movements. Cerebellar patients show impairments during online visuomotor adaptation tasks. Cerebellum-motor cortex inhibition (CBI) is a neurophysiological biomarker showing an inverse association between cerebellothalamocortical tract integrity and ataxia severity. Ataxic gait is characterized by increased step width, reduced ankle joint range of motion, increased gait variability, lack of intra-limb inter-joint and inter-segmental coordination, impaired foot ground placement and loss of trunk control.

Molecular mechanisms of ET remain poorly understood. Clinical data suggest the importance of the cerebellum in disease pathophysiology, and pathological studies indicate Purkinje Cells (PCs) incur damage. Our recent cerebellar cortex and PC-specific transcriptome studies identified alterations in calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways that included ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) in ET. RyR1 is an intracellular Ca2+ release channel located on the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), and in cerebellum is predominantly expressed in PCs. Under stress conditions, RyR1 undergoes several post-translational modifications (protein kinase A [PKA] phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation), coupled with depletion of the channel-stabilizing binding partner calstabin1, which collectively characterize a \"leaky channel\" biochemical signature. In this study, we found markedly increased PKA phosphorylation at the RyR1-S2844 site, increased RyR1 oxidation and nitrosylation, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex in postmortem ET cerebellum. Decreased calstabin1-RyR1-binding affinity correlated with loss of PCs and climbing fiber-PC synapses in ET. This 'leaky' RyR1 signature was not seen in control or Parkinson's disease cerebellum. Microsomes from postmortem cerebellum demonstrated excessive ER Ca2+ leak in ET\u00a0vs.\u00a0controls, attenuated by channel stabilization. We further studied the role of RyR1 in tremor using a mouse model harboring a RyR1 point mutation that mimics constitutive site-specific PKA phosphorylation (RyR1-S2844D). RyR1-S2844D homozygous mice develop a 10\u00a0Hz action tremor and robust abnormal oscillatory activity in cerebellar physiological recordings. Intra-cerebellar microinfusion of RyR1 agonist or antagonist, respectively, increased or decreased tremor amplitude in RyR1-S2844D mice, supporting a direct role of cerebellar RyR1 leakiness for tremor generation. Treating RyR1-S2844D mice with a novel RyR1 channel-stabilizing compound, Rycal, effectively dampened cerebellar oscillatory activity, suppressed tremor, and normalized cerebellar RyR1-calstabin1 binding.

Therefore, tracking the targeted movement and overall momentum simultaneously is critical for motor control research, but it remains an unmet need. Here, we introduce the intrinsic oscillatory property (IOP), a fundamental mechanical principle of physics, as a method for motion tracking in a force plate. The overall kinetic energy of animal motions can be transformed into the oscillatory amplitudes at the designed IOP frequency of the force plate, while the target movement has its own frequency features and can be tracked simultaneously. Using action tremor as an example, we reported that force plate-based IOP approach has superior performance and reliability in detecting both tremor severity and tremor frequency, showing a lower level of coefficient of variation (CV) compared with video- and accelerometer-based motion tracking methods and their combination. Under the locomotor suppression effect of medications, therapeutic effects on tremor severity can still be quantified by dynamically adjusting the overall locomotor activity detected by IOP.

Building off our prior study and now doubling the sample size, we conducted comparative analyses in a postmortem series of 320 brains on the severity and patterning of cerebellar cortex degenerative changes in ET (n\u2009=\u2009100), other neurodegenerative disorders of the cerebellum [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs, n\u2009=\u200947, including 13 SCA3 and 34 SCA1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 14); Friedreich's ataxia (FA, n\u2009=\u200913); multiple system atrophy (MSA), n\u2009=\u200929], and other disorders that may involve the cerebellum [Parkinson's disease (PD), n\u2009=\u200962; dystonia, n\u2009=\u200919] versus controls (n\u2009=\u200950). We generated data on 37 quantitative morphologic metrics, grouped into 8 broad categories: Purkinje cell (PC) loss, heterotopic PCs, PC dendritic changes, PC axonal changes (torpedoes), PC axonal changes (other than torpedoes), PC axonal changes (torpedo-associated), basket cell axonal hypertrophy, and climbing fiber-PC synaptic changes. Principal component analysis of z scored raw data across all diagnoses (11,651 data items) revealed that diagnostic groups were not uniform with respect to pathology. Dystonia and PD each differed from controls in only 4/37 and 5/37 metrics, respectively, whereas ET differed in 21, FA in 10, SCA3 in 10, MSA in 21, and SCA1/2/6/7/8/14 in 27. Pathological changes were generally on the milder end of the degenerative spectrum in ET, FA and SCA3, and on the more severe end of that spectrum in SCA1/2/6/7/8/14. Comparative analyses across morphologic categories demonstrated differences in relative expression, defining distinctive patterns of changes in these groups. In summary, we present a robust and reproducible method that identifies somewhat distinctive signatures of degenerative changes in the cerebellar cortex that mark each of these disorders.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Dystonia", "Essential tremor", "Histopathology", "Neurodegenerative", "Spinocerebellar ataxia"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cerebellar Cortex", "Cerebellum", "Dystonia", "Dystonic Disorders", "Essential Tremor", "Motor Disorders", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinson Disease", "Purkinje Cells", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, 75390-8813, USA. elan.louis@UTSouthwestern.edu."}, {"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John T", "Last Name": "Gionco", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whitney G", "Last Name": "Hartstone", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica B", "Last Name": "Musacchio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisa", "Last Name": "Portenti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan", "Last Name": "McCreary", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, 75390-8813, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2023Mar"}, {"PMID": "36577359", "Title": "Gambling associated risk-taking decision in cerebellar ataxia.", "Abstract": "People with cerebellar ataxia (CA) can develop impulsive and compulsive behaviors that significantly affect their and their family's quality of life.

Despite its high prevalence, the patho-mechanisms of tremor in ET are not fully known. Through comprehensive studies in postmortem brains, we identified major morphological changes in the ET cerebellum that reflect cellular damage in Purkinje cells (PCs), suggesting that PC damage is central to ET pathogenesis. We previously performed a transcriptome analysis in ET cerebellar cortex, identifying candidate genes and several dysregulated pathways. To directly target PCs, we purified RNA from PCs isolated by laser capture microdissection and performed the first ever PC-specific RNA-sequencing analysis in ET versus controls. Frozen postmortem cerebellar cortex from 24 ETs and 16 controls underwent laser capture microdissection, obtaining \u22652000 PCs per sample. RNA transcriptome was analyzed via differential gene expression, principal component analysis (PCA), and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). We identified 36 differentially expressed genes, encompassing multiple cellular processes. Some ET (13/24) had greater dysregulation of these genes and segregated from most controls and remaining ETs in PCA. Characterization of genes/pathways enriched in this PCA and GSEA identified multiple pathway dysregulations in ET, including RNA processing/splicing, synapse organization/ion transport, and oxidative stress/inflammation. Furthermore, a different set of pathways characterized marked heterogeneity among ET patients. Our data indicate a range of possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of ET. Significant heterogeneity among ET combined with dysregulation of multiple cellular processes supports the notion that ET is a family of disorders rather than one disease entity.", "Keywords": ["Essential tremor", "Laser capture microdissection", "Purkinje cell", "RNA-sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Purkinje Cells", "Essential Tremor", "Tremor", "Cerebellum", "Gene Expression Profiling", "RNA", "Lasers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, P&S 15-405, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karthigayini", "Last Name": "Sivaprakasam", "Affiliation": "Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whitney", "Last Name": "Hartstone", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, P&S 15-405, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 650 W 168th Street, BB302, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Genevieve", "Last Name": "Konopka", "Affiliation": "Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Suite NL9.114, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, P&S 15-405, New York, NY, 10032, USA. plf3@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "36185589", "Title": "What's in a Name?

Fifty-eight (25.1%) had LP and 46 (19.9%) had early to late stages of Parkinson disease (PD). LP was very heterogeneous.

In summary, 1 in 4 ET cases had LP-a proportion that seems higher than expected based on studies among control populations.

To increase this knowledge, the Pan American Hereditary Ataxia Network (PAHAN) conducted an exploratory survey about care for hereditary ataxias in American continents and the Caribbean. A questionnaire was sent to health professionals about the hereditary ataxias identified; access to care; and local teaching and research. The number of ataxics under current care per 100,000 inhabitants was subtracted from the expected overall prevalence of 6/100,000, to estimate the prevalence of uncovered ataxic patients. Local Human Development Indexes (HDI) were used to measure socio-economic factors. Twenty-six sites participated. Twelve sites had very high, 13 had high, and one site had medium HDI. Participants reported on 2239 and 602 patients with spinocerebellar ataxias and recessive forms under current care. The number of patients under current care per inhabitants varied between 0.14 and 12/100,000. The estimated prevalence of uncovered ataxic patients was inversely proportional to HDIs (rho\u2009=\u20090.665, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Access to diagnosis, pre-symptomatic tests, and rehabilitation were associated with HDIs. More and better molecular diagnostic tools, protocols and guidelines, and professional training for ataxia care were the top priorities common to all respondents. Evidence of inequalities was confirmed. Lower HDIs were associated with high potential numbers of uncovered ataxic subjects, and with lack of molecular diagnosis, pre-symptomatic testing, and rehabilitation. More and better diagnostic tools, guidelines, and professional training were priorities to all sites.

To determine whether a phase III trial comparing home aerobic to balance training in ambulatory patients with cerebellar ataxia is warranted, we conducted a single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Nineteen subjects were randomized to aerobic training and 17 subjects to balance training. The primary outcome was improvement in ataxia as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Secondary outcomes included safety, training adherence, and balance improvements. There were no differences between groups at baseline. Thirty-one participants completed the trial, and there were no training-related serious adverse events. Compliance to training was over 70%. There was a mean improvement in ataxia symptoms of 1.9 SARA points (SD 1.62) in the aerobic group compared to an improvement of 0.6 points (SD 1.34) in the balance group. Although two measures of balance were equivocal between groups, one measure of balance showed greater improvement with balance training compared to aerobic training. In conclusion, this 6-month trial comparing home aerobic versus balance training in cerebellar ataxia had excellent retention and adherence to training. There were no serious adverse events, and training was not interrupted by minor adverse events like falls or back pain. There was a significant improvement in ataxia symptoms with home aerobic training compared to balance training, and a phase III trial is warranted.

In recent years, studies on the clinical perspectives and pathophysiology have advanced our understanding of ET. Specifically, clinical heterogeneity of ET, with co-existence of tremor and other neurological features such as dystonia, ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction, has been identified. The cerebellum has been found to be the key brain region for tremor generation, and structural alterations of the cerebellum have been extensively studied in ET. Finally, four main ET pathophysiologies have been proposed: 1) environmental exposures to \u03b2-carboline alkaloids and the consequent olivocerebellar hyper-excitation, 2) cerebellar GABA deficiency, 3) climbing fiber synaptic pathology with related cerebellar oscillatory activity, 4) extra-cerebellar oscillatory activity. While these four theories are not mutually exclusive, they can represent distinctive ET subtypes, indicating multiple types of abnormal brain circuitry can lead to action tremor.

MT GCase at the lysosomal surface inhibits CMA, causing accumulation of CMA substrates including \u03b1-synuclein. Single-cell transcriptional analysis and proteomics of brains from GBA-PD patients confirmed reduced CMA activity and proteome changes comparable to those in CMA-deficient mouse brain.

In this paper, we identify the E3 ligase Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 12 (TRIP12) as a key regulator of GCase. TRIP12 interacts with and ubiquitinates GCase at lysine 293 to control its degradation via ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated GCase by TRIP12 leads to its functional impairment through premature degradation and subsequent accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein. TRIP12 overexpression causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is ameliorated by GCase overexpression. Further, conditional TRIP12 knockout in\u00a0vitro and knockdown in\u00a0vivo promotes the expression of GCase, which blocks \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils (\u03b1-syn PFFs)-provoked dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, TRIP12 accumulates in human PD brain and \u03b1-synuclein-based mouse models.

Using surface electroencephalogram, we studied cerebellar physiology in 40 ET cases (n\u2009=\u200922 familial and n\u2009=\u200918 sporadic) and 20 age-matched controls. Both familial and sporadic ET cases had an increase in the intensity of cerebellar oscillations when compared to controls. Interestingly, cerebellar oscillations correlated with tremor severity in familial ET but not in sporadic ET. Our study demonstrated that ET cases have enhanced cerebellar oscillations, and the different relationships between cerebellar oscillations and tremor severity in familial and sporadic ET suggest diverse cerebellar pathophysiology.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Electroencephalogram", "Essential tremor", "Oscillation", "Physiology", "Tremor"], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebellum", "Electroencephalography", "Essential Tremor", "Humans", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Tremor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shi-Bing", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Tzu Chi General Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, New Taipei City, 23142, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Yi-Mei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cerebellar Research Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Yun-Lin Branch, Yun-Lin, 64041, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chih-Chun", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott Kun", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nora", "Last Name": "Vanegas-Arroyave", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seth L", "Last Name": "Pullman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ming-Kai", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Cerebellar Research Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Yun-Lin Branch, Yun-Lin, 64041, Taipei, Taiwan. emorymkpan@ntu.edu.tw."}], "Journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "34295236", "Title": "Corrigendum: Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide Exerts Dopaminergic Neuroprotection Through Inhibition of Neuroinflammation.", "Abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fnagi.2019.00044.].", "Keywords": ["MAPK", "NF-\u03baB", "Parkinson's disease", "dl-3-n-butylphthalide", "microglia", "neuroinflammation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yajing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Heng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoying", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Mei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yun-Cheng", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34019331", "Title": "Spinocerebellar ataxia clinical trials: opportunities and challenges.", "Abstract": "The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of dominantly inherited diseases that share the defining feature of progressive cerebellar ataxia.

Over the past 15\u00a0years, we have carefully documented a large number of postmortem changes within the cerebellum; these cerebellar changes differ significantly between ET and controls. A recent Consensus Classification of tremor proposed that ET patients with other neurological signs aside from action tremor (e.g., parkinsonism, ataxia, cognitive changes, dystonia) should be segregated off as \"ET-plus\". This diagnostic concept has raised considerable controversy and its validity is not yet established. Indeed, \"ET-plus\" has not been distinguished from ET based on differences in genetics, pathology or prognosis. Here we determine whether ET cases differ from \"ET-plus\" cases in underlying pathological changes in the postmortem brain. We examined postmortem brains from 50 ET cases (24 ET and 26 ET-plus), using a set of 14 quantitative metrics of cerebellar pathology determined by histologic and immunohistochemical methods. These metrics reflect changes across the Purkinje cell (PC) body (PC counts, empty baskets, heterotopias), PC dendrites (swellings), PC axon (torpedoes and associated axonal changes), basket cell axonal hypertrophy and climbing fiber-PC dendrite synaptic changes. ET and ET-plus were similar with respect to 13 of 14 cerebellar pathologic metrics (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Only one metric, the linear density of thickened PC axon profiles, differed between these groups (ET\u2009=\u20090.529\u2009\u00b1\u20090.397, ET-plus\u2009=\u20090.777\u2009\u00b1\u20090.477, p\u2009=\u20090.013), although after correcting for multiple comparisons, there were no differences. If ET-plus were indeed a different entity, then the underlying pathological basis should be distinct from that of ET. This study demonstrated there were no pathological differences in cerebellar cortex between ET versus ET-plus cases. These data do not support the notion that ET and ET-plus represent distinct clinical-pathological entities.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Classification", "ET-plus", "Essential tremor", "Pathology"], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebellar Cortex", "Cerebellum", "Essential Tremor", "Humans", "Purkinje Cells", "Tremor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John T", "Last Name": "Gionco", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whitney G", "Last Name": "Hartstone", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, 75390-9020, USA.

Step-by-step optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition of neuronal firing, axonal activity, or synaptic vesicle release confirmed that the activity of the excessive CF-to-PC synapses is required for tremor generation. In vivo electrophysiology in mice showed that excessive cerebellar oscillatory activity is CF dependent and necessary for tremor and optogenetic-driven PC synchronization was sufficient to generate tremor in wild-type animals. Human validation by cerebellar electroencephalography confirmed that excessive cerebellar oscillations also exist in patients with ET.

While previous postmortem studies have identified a cluster of morphological changes in the ET cerebellum centered in/around the Purkinje cell (PC) population, including a loss of PCs in some studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms for these changes are not clear. As genomic studies of ET patients have yet to identify major genetic contributors and animal models that fully recapitulate the human disease do not yet exist, the study of human tissue is currently the most applicable method to gain a mechanistic insight into ET disease pathogenesis. To begin exploration of an underlying molecular source of ET disease pathogenesis, we have performed the first transcriptomic analysis by direct sequencing of RNA from frozen cerebellar cortex tissue in 33 ET patients compared to 21 normal controls. Principal component analysis showed a heterogenous distribution of the expression data in ET patients that only partially overlapped with control patients. Differential expression analysis identified 231 differentially expressed gene transcripts ('top gene hits'), a subset of which has defined expression profiles in the cerebellum across neuronal and glial cell types but a largely unknown relationship to cerebellar function and/or ET pathogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified dysregulated pathways of interest and stratified dysregulation among ET cases. By GSEA and mining curated databases, we compiled major categories of dysregulated processes and clustered string networks of known interacting proteins. Here we demonstrate that these 'top gene hits' contribute to regulation of four main biological processes, which are 1) axon guidance, 2) microtubule motor activity, 3) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport and 4) calcium signaling/synaptic transmission. The results of our transcriptomic analysis suggest there is a range of different processes involved among ET cases, and draws attention to a particular set of genes and regulatory pathways that provide an initial platform to further explore the underlying biology of ET.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Essential tremor", "Gene set enrichment analysis", "Purkinje cell", "RNA-seq", "String networks"], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebellar Cortex", "Databases, Genetic", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gene Expression", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, P&S 15-405, New York, NY, USA; College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA.

Although motor and balance deficits are the core symptoms of SCA1, cognitive decline is also commonly observed in patients. While mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, pathological findings reveal severe atrophy of cerebellar cortex in SCA1 patients. The cerebellum has recently been implicated in diverse cognitive functions, yet to what extent cerebellar neurodegeneration contributes to cognitive alterations in SCA1 remains poorly understood. Much of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of motor symptoms in SCA1 comes from mouse models. Reasoning that mouse models could similarly offer important insights into the mechanisms of cognitive alterations in SCA1, we tested cognition in several mouse lines using Barnes maze and fear conditioning.

These changes have not been contextualized within a broader degenerative disease spectrum, limiting their interpretability. To address this, we compared the severity and patterning of degenerative changes within the cerebellar cortex in patients with ET, other neurodegenerative disorders of the cerebellum (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), multiple system atrophy (MSA)], and other disorders that may involve the cerebellum [Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia]. Using a postmortem series of 156 brains [50 ET, 23 SCA (6 SCA3; 17 SCA 1, 2 or 6), 15 MSA, 29 PD, 14 dystonia, 25 controls], we generated data on 37 quantitative morphologic metrics, which were grouped into 8 broad categories: (1) PC loss, (2) heterotopic PCs, (3) PC dendritic changes, (4) PC axonal changes (torpedoes), (5) PC axonal changes (other than torpedoes), (6) PC axonal changes (torpedo-associated), (7) basket cell axonal hypertrophy, (8) climbing fiber-PC synaptic changes. Our analyses used z scored raw data for each metric across all diagnoses (5772 total data items). Principal component analysis revealed that diagnostic groups were not uniform with respect to cerebellar pathology. Dystonia and PD each differed from controls in only 2/37 metrics, whereas ET differed in 21, SCA3 in 8, MSA in 19, and SCA1/2/6 in 26 metrics. Comparing ET with primary disorders of cerebellar degeneration (i.e., SCAs), we observed a spectrum of changes reflecting differences of degree, being generally mild in ET and SCA3 and more severe in SCA1/2/6. Comparative analyses across morphologic categories demonstrated differences in relative expression, defining distinctive patterns of changes in these groups. Thus, the degree of cerebellar degeneration in ET aligns it with a milder end in the spectrum of cerebellar degenerative disorders, and a somewhat distinctive signature of degenerative changes marks each of these disorders.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Dystonia", "Essential tremor", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Spinocerebellar ataxia"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Axons", "Cerebellar Cortex", "Dystonic Disorders", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinson Disease", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA. elan.louis@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Chlo\u00eb A", "Last Name": "Kerridge", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debotri", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel Trujillo", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arnulf H", "Last Name": "Koeppen", "Affiliation": "Research, Neurology, and Pathology Services, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Departments of Neurology and Pathology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA. plf3@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2019Nov"}, {"PMID": "31165428", "Title": "Consensus Paper: Experimental Neurostimulation of the Cerebellum.", "Abstract": "The cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors.

This study is aimed to determine whether NBP could suppress microglial activation and protect dopaminergic neurons from excessive neuroinflammation. In the present study, MPTP-induced PD model was established to explore the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of NBP. We assessed motor deficits, dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial activation in PD mice. In vitro, the anti-inflammatory activity of NBP was confirmed by cell viability assay of SH-SY5Y cells after being treated with conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells and from 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+)-stimulated BV-2 cells. The expression of pro-inflammatory molecules was determined by RT-PCR, Western Blot and ELISA assay. The generation of NO and ROS were also assessed. The involvement of signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and PI3k/Akt were further investigated by Western Blot and immunofluorescence assay. The neuroprotective effect of NBP was demonstrated in vivo as shown by the improvement of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor deficits and microglial activation in MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators was also reduced by NBP administration. In vitro, NBP also protected dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxicity induced by activated microglia. NBP pretreatment not only reduced pro-inflammatory molecules, but also suppressed NO release and ROS generation in BV-2 cells. Further mechanism research suggested that the inactivation of MAPK, NF-\u03baB and PI3K/Akt may involve in anti-neuroinflammation role of NBP. In conclusion, our results revealed that NBP exerted dopaminergic neuroprotection through inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, suggesting the promising therapeutic effect of NBP for PD.", "Keywords": ["MAPK", "NF-\u03baB", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "dl-3-n-butylphthalide", "microglia", "neuroinflammation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yajing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Heng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoying", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Mei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, The Institutes of Brain Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yun-Cheng", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30838304", "Title": "Skill Training Resulted in Improved Swallowing in a Person with Multiple System Atrophy: An Endoscopy Study.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["dysphagia", "multiple system atrophy", "rehabilitation", "skill\u2010training", "swallowing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Perry", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction Columbia University Teachers College New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordanna S", "Last Name": "Sevitz", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction Columbia University Teachers College New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Curtis", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction Columbia University Teachers College New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology Columbia University New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle S", "Last Name": "Troche", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction Columbia University Teachers College New York NY USA."}], "Journal": "Movement disorders clinical practice", "PubDate": "2018Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "30830673", "Title": "Tremor in the Degenerative Cerebellum: Towards the Understanding of Brain Circuitry for Tremor.", "Abstract": "Cerebellar degenerative pathology has been identified in tremor patients; however, how the degenerative pathology could contribute to tremor remains unclear. If the cerebellar degenerative pathology can directly drive tremor, one would hypothesize that tremor is likely to occur in the diseases of cerebellar ataxia and follows the disease progression in such disorders. To further test this hypothesis, we studied the occurrence of tremor in different disease stages of classical cerebellar degenerative disorders: spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We further separately analyzed postural tremor and rest tremor, two forms of tremor that both involve the cerebellum. We also explored tremor in different subtypes of SCAs. We found that 18.1% of SCA patients have tremor. Interestingly, SCA patients with tremor have worse ataxia than those without tremor. When stratifying patients into mild, moderate, and severe disease stages according to the severity of ataxia, moderate and severe SCA patients more commonly have tremor than those with mild ataxia, the effect most prominently observed in postural tremor of SCA3 and SCA6 patients. Finally, tremor can independently contribute to worse functional status in SCA2 patients, even after adjusting for ataxia severity. Tremor is more likely to occur in the severe stage of cerebellar degeneration when compared to mild stages.

Here, we show that in GbaL444P/WT knockin mice, the L444P heterozygous Gba mutation triggers mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy and mitochondrial priming, two steps critical for the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. In SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, the overexpression of L444P GBA impeded mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction when endogenous lysosomal GBA activity remained intact. By contrast, genetic depletion of GBA inhibited lysosomal clearance of autophagic cargo. The link between heterozygous GBA mutations and impaired mitophagy was corroborated in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations, where we found increased mitochondrial content, mitochondria oxidative stress and impaired autophagy. Our findings thus suggest a mechanistic basis for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with GBA heterozygous mutations.

Postmortem studies have noted a series of pathological changes in the ET cerebellum. Heterotopic Purkinje cells (PCs) are those whose cell body is mis-localized in the molecular layer. In neurodegenerative settings, these are viewed as a marker of the progression of neuronal degeneration. We (1) quantify heterotopias in ET cases vs. controls, (2) compare ET cases to other cerebellar degenerative conditions (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, and 6), (3) compare these SCAs to one another, and (4) assess heterotopia within the context of associated PC loss in each disease. Heterotopic PCs were quantified using a standard LH&E-stained section of the neocerebellum. Counts were normalized to PC layer length (n-heterotopia count). It is also valuable to consider PC counts when assessing heterotopia, as loss of PCs extends both to normally located as well as heterotopic PCs. Therefore, we divided n-heterotopias by PC counts. There were 96 brains (43 ET, 31 SCA [12 SCA1, 7 SCA2, 7 SCA3, 5 SCA6], and 22 controls). The median number of n-heterotopias in ET cases was two times higher than that of the controls (2.6 vs. 1.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The median number of n-heterotopias in the various SCAs formed a spectrum, with counts being highest in SCA3 and SCA1. In analyses that factored in PC counts, ET had a median n-heterotopia/Purkinje cell count that was three times higher than the controls (0.35 vs. 0.13, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and SCA1 and SCA2 had counts that were 5.5 and 11 times higher than the controls (respective p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The median n-heterotopia/PC count in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs. Similarly, the median PC count in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs; the one exception was SCA3, in which the PC population is well known to be preserved. Heterotopia is a disease-associated feature of ET. In comparison, several of the SCAs evidenced even more marked heterotopia, although a spectrum existed across the SCAs. The median n-heterotopia/PC count and median PC in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs; hence, in this regard, ET could represent an intermediate state or a less advanced state of spinocerebellar atrophy.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Essential tremor", "Heterotopia", "Neurodegenerative", "Pathology", "Purkinje cell", "Spinocerebellar ataxia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Autopsy", "Choristoma", "Diagnosis", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Purkinje Cells", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA. elan.louis@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Tate", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey C", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesus", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA."}, {"First Name": "Etty P", "Last Name": "Cortes", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "28674165", "Title": "Clinical Reasoning: A 58-year-old man with progressive ptosis and walking difficulty.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blepharoptosis", "DNA Polymerase gamma", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mobility Limitation", "Muscle Weakness", "Mutation", "Parkinsonian Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pei-Hsin", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology (P.-H.K., K.T., S.-H.K.) and Pathology and Cell Biology (K.T.), Columbia University, New York, NY; and the Department of Neurology (P.-H.K., R.Y.L.), Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Raymond Y", "Last Name": "Lo", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology (P.-H.K., K.T., S.-H.K.) and Pathology and Cell Biology (K.T.), Columbia University, New York, NY; and the Department of Neurology (P.-H.K., R.Y.L.), Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology (P.-H.K., K.T., S.-H.K.) and Pathology and Cell Biology (K.T.), Columbia University, New York, NY; and the Department of Neurology (P.-H.K., R.Y.L.), Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology (P.-H.K., K.T., S.-H.K.) and Pathology and Cell Biology (K.T.), Columbia University, New York, NY; and the Department of Neurology (P.-H.K., R.Y.L.), Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan. sk3295@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2017Jul04"}, {"PMID": "28637818", "Title": "The cerebellum does more than sensory prediction error-based learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks.", "Abstract": "Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory prediction error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why do individuals with cerebellar damage not come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, before executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared with healthy control participants, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (experiment 1) or gradually (experiment 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (experiment 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory prediction error-based learning but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with cerebellar pathology are impaired in sensorimotor adaptation. This deficit has been attributed to an impairment in error-based learning, specifically, from a deficit in using sensory prediction errors to update an internal model.

We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell (PC) counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes, heterotopic PCs, and hairy basket ratings) in 60 ET cases and 30 controls. Familial ET was defined using both liberal criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and conservative criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a020). When compared with controls, ET cases had lower PC counts, more torpedoes, more heterotopic PCs, a higher hairy basket rating, an increase in PC axonal collaterals, an increase in PC thickened axonal profiles, and an increase in PC axonal branching. Familial and sporadic ET had similar postmortem changes, with few exceptions, regardless of the definition criteria. The PC counts were marginally lower in familial than sporadic ET (respective p values\u00a0=\u00a00.059 [using liberal criteria] and 0.047 [using conservative criteria]).

In SCA1, gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease presented 9\u00a0years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression.

Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid surrounding the central nervous system, and the protein and lipid content alterations in the CSF could be biomarkers for degenerative changes in the brain. The laboratory diagnosis of AD is limited to the analysis of three biomarkers in CSF: A\u03b242, total tau, and phospho-tau. The purpose of this analysis is to systematically analyze the available data describing the biomarkers of cholesterol and its metabolites in the CSF of subjects with AD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central database were systematically queried to collect studies that have evaluated the markers of cholesterol and its metabolites in the CSF of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and age-matched controls. Analysis of the published data shows that the levels of cholesterol are increased in MCI subjects; 24-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol are elevated in AD and MCI subjects compared to controls. There is a significant dysfunction of cholesterol metabolism in the CSF of AD subjects. This analysis indicates that in addition to the available biomarkers in the CSF, such as A\u03b242, total tau, and phospho-tau, 24-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol appear to be sensitive biomarkers for the evaluation of MCI and AD.", "Keywords": ["24-hydroxycholesterol", "27-hydroxycholesterol", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrospinal fluid", "cholesterol"], "MeSH

However, their mechanisms and their relationship still require further study. In the present study, we focused on the change and relationship of SIRT1 and HIF-1\u03b1 in PD. PD cell models were established by using methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), which induced inhibition of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We found that the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and its target genes VEGFA and LDHA increased and that SIRT1 expression was inhibited in MPP(+) treated cells. With further analysis, we found that the acetylation of H3K14 combined with the HIF-1\u03b1 promoter was dramatically increased in cells treated with MPP(+), which resulted in the transcriptional activation of HIF-1\u03b1. Moreover, the acetylation of H3K14 and the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 increased when SIRT1 was knocked down, suggesting that SIRT1 was involved in the epigenetic regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. At last, phenformin, another mitochondrial complex1 inhibitor, was used to testify that the increased HIF-1a was not due to off target effects of MPP(+). Therefore, our results support a link between PD and SIRT1/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling, which may serve as a clue for understanding PD.", "Keywords": ["Acetylation", "Epigenetics", "H3K14", "Hypoxia inducible factor-1", "Parkinson's disease", "Silent information regulator 1"], "MeSH terms": ["1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Neurons", "Parkinson Disease", "Sirtuin 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Su-Yan", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200080, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yan-Jie", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200080, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ya", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200080, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xin-Xin", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200080, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Te", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Geriatric Institute of Chinese Medicine, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200031, PR China.

We now analyze the regularity of distribution of Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer to determine whether there is greater disorganization in ET cases than in age-matched controls. A standard parasagittal, formalin-fixed, tissue block was harvested from the neocerebellum of 50 ET cases and 25 age-matched controls. The gap length distance (\u03bcm) between Purkinje cells was quantified using a nearest neighbor analysis in which the distance between each Purkinje cell body was measured in OpenLAB software, version 5 (Improvision, Waltham, MA) by drawing a freehand line between adjacent Purkinje cell bodies along the entirety of the Purkinje cell layer within a given image. We analyzed the subject-specific variation in the organization of Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer. The 50 ET cases and 25 controls were similar in age at death, gender, and brain weight. Overall, greater variation in gap length distance (i.e., more disorganization) was associated with greater gap length distance (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and younger age (p\u2009=\u20090.020).

However, it is unknown whether the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in GBA carriers is due to a loss of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity. We measured glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 517) and controls (n = 252) with and without GBA mutations. Participants were recruited from Columbia University, New York, and fully sequenced for GBA mutations and genotyped for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, the most common autosomal dominant mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots was measured by a mass spectrometry-based assay and compared among participants categorized by GBA mutation status and Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Parkinson's disease patients were more likely than controls to carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (n = 39, 7.5% versus n = 2, 0.8%, P < 0.001) and GBA mutations or variants (seven homozygotes and compound heterozygotes and 81 heterozygotes, 17.0% versus 17 heterozygotes, 6.7%, P < 0.001). GBA homozygotes/compound heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA heterozygotes (0.85 \u00b5mol/l/h versus 7.88 \u00b5mol/l/h, P < 0.001), and GBA heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA and LRRK2 non-carriers (7.88 \u00b5mol/l/h versus 11.93 \u00b5mol/l/h, P < 0.001). Glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced in heterozygotes compared to non-carriers when each mutation was compared independently (N370S, P < 0.001; L444P, P < 0.001; 84GG, P = 0.003; R496H, P = 0.018) and also reduced in GBA variants associated with Parkinson's risk but not with Gaucher disease (E326K, P = 0.009; T369M, P < 0.001). When all patients with Parkinson's disease were considered, they had lower mean glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity than controls (11.14 \u00b5mol/l/h versus 11.85 \u00b5mol/l/h, P = 0.011). Difference compared to controls persisted in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (after exclusion of all GBA and LRRK2 carriers; 11.53 \u00b5mol/l/h, versus 12.11 \u00b5mol/l/h, P = 0.036) and after adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.012). Interestingly, LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n = 36), most of whom had Parkinson's disease, had higher enzymatic activity than non-carriers (13.69 \u00b5mol/l/h versus 11.93 \u00b5mol/l/h, P = 0.002). In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's, higher glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity was associated with longer disease duration (P = 0.002) in adjusted models, suggesting a milder disease course. We conclude that lower glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is strongly associated with GBA mutations, and modestly with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The association of lower glucocerebrosidase activity in both GBA mutation carriers and Parkinson's patients without GBA mutations suggests that loss of glucocerebrosidase function contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. High glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in LRRK2 G2019S carriers may reflect a distinct pathogenic mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity could be a modifiable therapeutic target.", "Keywords": ["LRRK2", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "genetics", "glucocerebrosidase", "lysosome"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Genotype", "Glucosylceramidase", "Humans", "Jews", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roy N", "Last Name": "Alcalay", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA 2 Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA rna2104@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Oren A", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA 2 Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl C", "Last Name": "Waters", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Fahn", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Blair", "Last Name": "Ford", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Mazzoni", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Pauciulo", "Affiliation": "3 Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the Department of Pediatrics; University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "William C", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "3 Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the Department of Pediatrics; University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ziv", "Last Name": "Gan-Or", "Affiliation": "4 Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Guy A", "Last Name": "Rouleau", "Affiliation": "4 Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavlina", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "6 Global BioTherapeutics, Genzyme, a Sanofi company, Framingham, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Petra", "Last Name": "Oliva", "Affiliation": "6 Global BioTherapeutics, Genzyme, a Sanofi company, Framingham, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Keutzer", "Affiliation": "6 Global BioTherapeutics, Genzyme, a Sanofi company, Framingham, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Marder", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA 2 Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA 7 Gertrude H.

SLC1A2 encodes excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2), which clears glutamate from the synaptic cleft. One postulated mechanism for essential tremor is the over-excitation of glutamatergic olivo-cerebellar climbing fibers, leading to excitotoxic death of Purkinje cells. Other glutamatergic excitatory signals are transmitted to Purkinje cells via parallel fibers of cerebellar granule neurons. Therefore, the expression level of glutamate transporters could be important in essential tremor pathogenesis. Using Western blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two main glutamate transporters in the cerebellar cortex, EAAT1 and EAAT2, in postmortem tissue from 16 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls. We also studied the localization of EAAT1 and EAAT2 using immunohistochemistry in 10 essential tremor cases and 12 controls. EAAT1 protein levels were similar in cases and controls (1.12 \u00b1 0.83 vs. 1.01 \u00b1 0.69, p =0.71) whereas EAAT2 protein levels in essential tremor cases were only 1/3 of that in controls (0.35 \u00b1 0.23 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.62, p < 0.01). Interestingly, EAAT2, but not EAAT1, was expressed in astrocytic processes surrounding the Purkinje cell axon initial segment, a region of previously observed pathological changes in essential tremor.

Climbing fibres provide one of the major excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells, and climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections are essential for normal cerebellar-mediated motor control. The distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on Purkinje cell dendrites is dynamically regulated and may be altered in disease states. The aim of the present study was to examine the density and distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses using post-mortem cerebellar tissue of essential tremor cases and controls. Using vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 immunohistochemistry, we labelled climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses of 12 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls from the New York Brain Bank. Normally, climbing fibres form synapses mainly on the thick, proximal Purkinje cell dendrites in the inner portion of the molecular layer, whereas parallel fibres form synapses on the thin, distal Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. We observed that, compared with controls, essential tremor cases had decreased climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synaptic density, more climbing fibres extending to the outer portion of the molecular layer, and more climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on the thin Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Interestingly, in essential tremor, the increased distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on the thin Purkinje cell branchlets was inversely associated with clinical tremor severity, indicating a close relationship between the altered distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections and tremor.

We quantified torpedoes and PCs in four groups: essential tremor (ET), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), multiple system atrophy-cerebellar (MSA-C), and controls. Brains from 100 individuals (58 ET, 27 controls, 7 SCA, 8 MSA-C) were available at the New York Brain Bank. After complete neuropathological assessment, a standard parasagittal neocerebellar block was harvested; a 7-\u03bcm thick section was stained with Luxol fast blue/hematoxylin and eosin; and torpedoes and PCs were quantified. For a given PC count, SCA and MSA-C cases often had higher torpedo counts than ET cases or controls. Furthermore, the relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex. The correlation between torpedo and PC counts was negative in ET cases (i.e., individuals with more torpedoes had fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss]) whereas the relationship was positive in MSA-C cases (i.e., individuals with fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss] had fewer torpedoes). Patients with SCA showed both patterns. When all diagnostic groups were combined, the correlation was best fit by a quadratic (i.e., parabolic) model rather than a simple linear model; this model incorporated data on the negative correlation in ET cases, the mixed results in SCA cases, and the positive correlation in MSA-C cases (r\u2009=\u20090.636). The relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex and heterogeneous across a range of cerebellar disease states, and was best characterized by a quadratic rather than a simple model.

The metabolic mechanism of AD has emerged in recent years. In this study, we used multivariate analyses of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements to determine that learning and retention-related metabolic profiles are altered during aging in the hippocampus of the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). Alterations in 17 metabolites were detected in mature and aged mice compared to young mice (13 decreased and 4 increased metabolites), including metabolites related to dysfunctional lipid metabolism (significantly increased cholesterol, oleic acid, and phosphoglyceride levels), decreased amino acid (alanine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid), and energy-related metabolite levels (malic acid, butanedioic acid, fumaric acid, and citric acid), and other altered metabolites (increased N-acetyl-aspartic acid and decreased pyroglutamic acid, urea, and lactic acid) in the hippocampus. All of these alterations indicated that the metabolic mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice were related to multiple pathways and networks.

However, the role that Lingo-1 might play in pathogenesis of ET is not understood. Since Lingo-1 protein is a negative regulator of axonal regeneration and neurite outgrowth, it could contribute to Purkinje cell (PC) or basket cell axonal pathology observed in postmortem studies of ET brains. In this study, we used Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine Lingo-1 protein in ET vs. control brains. In Western blots, Lingo-1 protein expression level was significantly increased in cerebellar cortex (1.56 \u00b1 0.46 in ET cases vs. 0.99 \u00b1 0.20 in controls, p = 0.002), but was similar in the occipital cortex (p = 1.00) of ET cases vs. controls. Lingo-1 immunohistochemistry in cerebellum revealed that Lingo-1 was enriched in the distal axonal processes of basket cells, which formed a \"pinceau\" structure around the PC axon initial segment (AIS). We found that some Lingo-1-positive pinceau had abnormally elongated processes, targeting PC axon segments distal to the AIS. In ET cases, the percentage of Lingo-1-positive pinceau that were \u226530 or \u226540 \u03bcm in length was increased 2.4- to 4.1-fold, respectively, vs. pinceau seen in control brains (p < 0.0001). Elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau strongly correlated with number of PC axonal torpedoes and a rating of basket cell axonal pathology. The increased cerebellar Lingo-1 expression and elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau processes could contribute to the abnormal PC and basket cell axonal pathology and cerebellar dysfunction observed in ET.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Axons", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebellum", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Occipital Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10032, USA. sk3295@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Babji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Balatbat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Etty", "Last Name": "Cortes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ai", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23333625", "Title": "Mitochondrial abnormalities in temporal lobe of autistic brain.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of complex developmental disabilities characterized by impaired social interactions, deficits in communication and repetitive behavior. Multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. In postmortem BA21 temporal cortex, a region that exhibits synaptic pathology in ASD, we found that compared to controls, ASD patients exhibited altered protein levels of mitochondria respiratory chain protein complexes, decreased Complex I and IV activities, decreased mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and greater oxidative DNA damage. Mitochondrial membrane mass was higher in ASD brain, as indicated by higher protein levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20, Tim23 and porin. No differences were observed in either mitochondrial DNA or levels of the mitochondrial gene transcription factor TFAM or cofactor PGC1\u03b1, indicating that a mechanism other than alterations in mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial biogenesis underlies these mitochondrial abnormalities. We further identified higher levels of the mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1 and Drp1) and decreased levels of the fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) in ASD patients, indicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in ASD brain. Many of these changes were evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but were less pronounced or absent in adult patients. Together, these findings provide evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox status are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autistic Disorder", "Blotting, Western", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Stress", "Temporal Lobe", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Puri", "Last Name": "Gutierrez Rios", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasan Orhan", "Last Name": "Akman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gorazd", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Schon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Dimauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}]
