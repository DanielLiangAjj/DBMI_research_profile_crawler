[{"PMID": "38368936", "Title": "Endo-lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases: opinion on current progress and future direction in the use of exosomes as biomarkers.", "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, increased research has highlighted the connection between endosomal trafficking defects and neurodegeneration. The endo-lysosomal network is an important, complex cellular system specialized in the transport of proteins, lipids, and other metabolites, essential for cell homeostasis. Disruption of this pathway is linked to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that defects in this pathway create opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. In this Opinion piece, we concisely address the role of endo-lysosomal dysfunction in five neurodegenerative diseases and discuss how future research can investigate this intracellular pathway, including extracellular vesicles with a specific focus on exosomes for the identification of novel disease biomarkers.

Next, by imaging mouse models, we show that the trans-entorhinal cortex, a region most vulnerable to AD, is most susceptible to VPS26b depletion-a finding validated by electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and behavior. VPS26b was then found enriched in the trans-entorhinal cortex of human brains, where both VPS26b and the retromer-related receptor SORL1 were found deficient in AD.

However, the extent to which cerebrovascular disease represents an independent pathognomonic feature of Alzheimer's disease or directly promotes Alzheimer's pathology is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between white matter hyperintensities and plasma levels of tau and to determine if white matter hyperintensities and tau levels interact to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To confirm that cerebrovascular disease promotes tau pathology, we examined tau fluid biomarker concentrations and pathology in a mouse model of ischaemic injury. Three hundred ninety-one participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (74.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1\u2009years of age) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Participants had measurements of plasma total-tau, cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid, and white matter hyperintensities, and were diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's disease (n\u2009=\u200997), mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u2009186) or cognitively normal control (n\u2009=\u2009108). We tested the relationship between plasma tau concentration and white matter hyperintensity volume across diagnostic groups. We also examined the extent to which white matter hyperintensity volume, plasma tau, amyloid positivity status and the interaction between white matter hyperintensities and plasma tau correctly classifies diagnostic category. Increased white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with higher plasma tau concentration, particularly among those diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer's disease. Presence of brain amyloid and the interaction between plasma tau and white matter hyperintensity volume distinguished Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment participants from controls with 77.6% and 63.3% accuracy, respectively. In 63 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants who came to autopsy (82.33\u2009\u00b1\u20097.18 age at death), we found that higher degrees of arteriosclerosis were associated with higher Braak staging, indicating a positive relationship between cerebrovascular disease and neurofibrillary pathology. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, aged mice that received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, but not sham surgery, had increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid tau concentrations, induced myelin loss, and hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cerebral hemisphere. These findings demonstrate a relationship between cerebrovascular disease, operationalized as white matter hyperintensities, and tau levels, indexed in the plasma, suggesting that hypoperfusive injury promotes tau pathology. This potential causal association is supported by the demonstration that transient cerebral artery occlusion induces white matter damage, increases biofluidic markers of tau, and promotes cerebral tau hyperphosphorylation in older-adult mice.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "plasma biomarkers", "tau", "white matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krystal K", "Last Name": "Laing", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, G.H.
