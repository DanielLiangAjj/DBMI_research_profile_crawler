The recently described mScarlet-I3 protein has properties that may overcome this limitation. We compare here the brightness and maturation time of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineered mScarlet, mScarlet3, mScarlet-I3 and GFP reporter knock-ins. Comparing the onset and brightness of expression of reporter alleles of C. elegans golg-4, encoding a broadly expressed Golgi resident protein, we found that the onset of detection of mScarlet-I3 in the embryo is several hours earlier than older versions of mScarlet and comparable to GFP. These findings were further supported by comparing mScarlet-I3 and GFP reporter alleles for pks-1, a gene expressed in the CAN neuron and cells of the alimentary system, as well as reporter alleles for the panneuronal, nuclear marker unc-75. Hence, the relative properties of mScarlet-I3 and GFP do not depend on cellular or subcellular context.

In the C. elegans nervous system, neurotransmitter identities have been largely assigned by expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant cis-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 16 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in reporter strains for all main types of neurotransmitters in C. elegans (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine) in both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia, as well as non-neural cells. The resulting expression atlas defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic, substantially expands the repertoire of neurons capable of co-transmitting multiple neurotransmitters, and identifies novel neurons that uptake monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Furthermore, we also observed unusual co-expression patterns of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, each individual neuron class is defined by the expression of unique combinations of homeobox genes, prompting the question of whether each neuron class indeed requires a homeobox gene for its proper identity specification. We present here progress in addressing this question by extending previous mutant analysis of homeobox gene family members and describing multiple examples of homeobox gene function in different parts of the C. elegans nervous system. To probe homeobox function, we make use of a number of reporter gene tools, including a novel multicolor reporter transgene, NeuroPAL, which permits simultaneous monitoring of the execution of multiple differentiation programs throughout the entire nervous system. Using these tools, we add to the previous characterization of homeobox gene function by identifying neuronal differentiation defects for 14 homeobox genes in 24 distinct neuron classes that are mostly unrelated by location, function and lineage history. 12 of these 24 neuron classes had no homeobox gene function ascribed to them before, while in the other 12 neuron classes, we extend the combinatorial code of transcription factors required for specifying terminal differentiation programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in a particular lineage, homeotic identity transformations occur upon loss of a homeobox gene and we show that these transformations are the result of changes in homeobox codes. Combining the present with past analyses, 113 of the 118 neuron classes of C. elegans are now known to require a homeobox gene for proper execution of terminal differentiation programs.

We show here that the six very similar members of the Caenorhabditis elegans IL2 sensory neuron class, which are all specified by a homeobox terminal selector, unc-86/BRN3, differentiate into two subtly distinct subclasses, a dorsoventral subclass and a lateral subclass, by the toggle switch-like action of the sine oculis/SIX homeobox gene unc-39. unc-39 is expressed only in the lateral IL2 neurons, and loss of unc-39 leads to a homeotic transformation of the lateral into the dorsoventral class; conversely, ectopic unc-39 expression converts the dorsoventral subclass into the lateral subclass. Hence, a terminal selector homeobox gene controls both class- as well as subclass-specific features, while a subordinate homeobox gene determines the ability of the class-specific homeobox gene to activate subtype-specific target genes.

Strikingly, all 15 neuron classes expressing unc-42 are synaptically interconnected, prompting us to investigate whether unc-42 controls the functional properties of this circuit and perhaps also the assembly of these neurons into functional circuitry. We found that unc-42 defines the routes of communication between these interconnected neurons by controlling the expression of neurotransmitter pathway genes, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, and neuropeptide receptors. Anatomical analysis of unc-42 mutant animals reveals defects in axon pathfinding and synaptic connectivity, paralleled by expression defects of molecules involved in axon pathfinding, cell-cell recognition, and synaptic connectivity. We conclude that unc-42 establishes functional circuitry by acting as a terminal selector of functionally connected neuron types. We identify a number of additional transcription factors that are also expressed in synaptically connected neurons and propose that terminal selectors may also function as 'circuit organizer transcription factors' to control the assembly of functional circuitry throughout the nervous system.

The transcription factor TRA-1 is the master regulator of somatic sexual differentiation in the nematode C.\u00a0elegans, where it was reported to be expressed sex-specifically in the non-gonadal soma of hermaphrodites. Using a gfp-tagged allele of tra-1, we reveal unanticipated dynamics of TRA-1 protein expression in five dimensions: space, time, sex, environment, and subcellular localization. We show temporal regulation of TRA-1 protein accumulation in somatic tissues with different onsets of expression in different tissue types, indicating that sexual identity is not uniformly imposed. In hermaphrodites, neuronal expression is initially highly restricted and then increases variably between individuals during larval development until reaching panneuronal expression in the fourth larval stage. Unexpectedly, TRA-1 also accumulates in a subset of sex-shared neurons in the male. Additionally, a food signal is required to turn on TRA-1 expression in the intestine, and environmental stressors shut off TRA-1 expression in the entire non-gonadal soma, suggesting that somatic sexual differentiation may be affected by external conditions. We show that, in contrast to the protein degradation mechanisms that control TRA-1 accumulation in the adult, the temporal, sexual, and spatial specificities of TRA-1 accumulation during development are regulated transcriptionally. A nuclear hormone receptor, daf-12, previously implicated in developmental timing in C.\u00a0elegans, contributes to temporal accumulation of TRA-1 in the nervous system.

These genes are specifically expressed in defined subsets of cells in the nervous system. Through transgenic reporter gene assays, we find that the cellular specificity of expression of all of these genes is controlled in a modular manner through distinct cis-regulatory elements, corroborating the previously inferred piecemeal nature of specification of neurotransmitter identity. This modularity provides the mechanistic basis for the phenomenon of \"phenotypic convergence,\" in which distinct regulatory pathways can generate similar phenotypic outcomes (i.e., the acquisition of a specific neurotransmitter identity) in different neuron classes. We also identify cases of enhancer pleiotropy, in which the same cis-regulatory element is utilized to control gene expression in distinct neuron types. We engineered a cis-regulatory allele of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, unc-17/VAChT, to assess the functional contribution of a \"shadowed\" enhancer. We observed a selective loss of unc-17/VAChT expression in one cholinergic pharyngeal pacemaker motor neuron class and a behavioral phenotype that matches microsurgical removal of this neuron.

Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re-evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter- and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross-connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory-motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx.

In the context of nervous system development, one may ask whether the generation of its highly diverse sets of constituents, that is, distinct neuronal cell types, relies on genetic mechanisms that share specific common features. Specifically, are there common patterns in the function of regulatory genes across different neuron types and are those regulatory mechanisms not only used in different parts of one nervous system, but are they conserved across animal phylogeny? We address these questions here by focusing on one specific, highly conserved and well-studied regulatory factor, the POU homeodomain transcription factor UNC-86. Work over the last 30\u2009years has revealed a common and paradigmatic theme of unc-86 function throughout most of the neuron types in which Caenorhabditis elegans unc-86 is expressed. Apart from its role in preventing lineage reiterations during development, UNC-86 operates in combination with distinct partner proteins to initiate and maintain terminal differentiation programs, by coregulating a vast array of functionally distinct identity determinants of specific neuron types. Mouse orthologs of unc-86, the Brn3 genes, have been shown to fulfill a similar function in initiating and maintaining neuronal identity in specific parts of the mouse brain and similar functions appear to be carried out by the sole Drosophila ortholog, Acj6. The terminal selector function of UNC-86 in many different neuron types provides a paradigm for neuronal identity regulation across phylogeny.

Three SLC protein families transport distinct neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles to enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system. Among them is the SLC17A6/7/8 family of vesicular glutamate transporters, which endows specific neuronal cell types with the ability to use glutamate as a neurotransmitter. The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes three SLC17A6/7/8 family members, one of which, eat-4/VGLUT, has been shown to be involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Here, we describe our analysis of the two remaining, previously uncharacterized SLC17A6/7/8 family members, vglu-2 and vglu-3 These two genes directly neighbor one another and are the result of a recent gene duplication event in C. elegans, but not in other Caenorhabditis species. Compared to EAT-4, the VGLU-2 and VGLU-3 protein sequences display a more distant similarity to canonical, vertebrate VGLUT proteins. We tagged both genomic loci with gfp and detected no expression of vglu-3 at any stage of development in any cell type of both C. elegans sexes. In contrast, vglu-2::gfp is dynamically expressed in a restricted set of distinct cell types. Within the nervous system, vglu-2::gfp is exclusively expressed in a single interneuron class, AIA, where it localizes to vesicular structures in the soma, but not along the axon, suggesting that VGLU-2 may not be involved in synaptic transport of glutamate. Nevertheless, vglu-2 mutants are partly defective in the function of the AIA neuron in olfactory behavior. Outside the nervous system, VGLU-2 is expressed in collagen secreting skin cells where VGLU-2 most prominently localizes to early endosomes, and to a lesser degree to apical clathrin-coated pits, the trans-Golgi network, and late endosomes. On early endosomes, VGLU-2 colocalizes most strongly with the recycling promoting factor SNX-1, a retromer component. Loss of vglu-2 affects the permeability of the collagen-containing cuticle of the worm, and based on the function of a vertebrate VGLUT1 protein in osteoclasts, we speculate that vglu-2 may have a role in collagen trafficking in the skin.

The effectiveness of such induced cellular reprogramming is generally greatly reduced if the cellular substrates are fully differentiated cells. For example, in the nematode C. elegans, the ectopic expression of a neuronal identity-inducing transcription factor, CHE-1, can effectively induce CHE-1 target genes in immature cells but not in fully mature non-neuronal cells. To understand the molecular basis of this progressive restriction of cellular plasticity, we screened for C. elegans mutants in which ectopically expressed CHE-1 is able to induce neuronal effector genes in epidermal cells. We identified a ubiquitin hydrolase, usp-48, that restricts cellular plasticity with a notable cellular specificity. Even though we find usp-48 to be very broadly expressed in all tissue types, usp-48 null mutants specifically make epidermal cells susceptible to CHE-1-mediated activation of neuronal target genes. We screened for additional genes that allow epidermal cells to be at least partially reprogrammed by ectopic che-1 expression and identified many additional proteins that restrict cellular plasticity of epidermal cells, including a chromatin-related factor (H3K79 methyltransferase, DOT-1.1), a transcription factor (nuclear hormone receptor NHR-48), two MAPK-type protein kinases (SEK-1 and PMK-1), a nuclear localized O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT-1) and a member of large family of nuclear proteins related to the Rb-associated LIN-8 chromatin factor.

One possibility is that regulatory factors that initiate a terminal differentiation program during development are continuously required to maintain the differentiated state. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the function of two orthologous POU homeobox genes in nematodes and mice. The C.\u00a0elegans POU homeobox gene unc-86 is a terminal selector that is required during development to initiate the terminal differentiation program of several distinct neuron classes [4-13]. Through post-developmental removal of unc-86 activity, we show here that unc-86 is also continuously required throughout the life of many neuron classes to maintain neuron-class-specific identity features. Similarly, the mouse unc-86 ortholog Brn3a/POU4F1 has been shown to control the initiation of the terminal differentiation program of distinct neuron types across the mouse brain, such as the medial habenular neurons [14-20]. By conditionally removing Brn3a in the adult mouse central nervous system, we show that, like its invertebrate ortholog unc-86, Brn3a is also required for the maintenance of terminal identity features of medial habenular neurons. In addition, Brn3a is required for the survival of these neurons, indicating that identity maintenance and survival are genetically linked.

Drosophila Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a C. elegans AS-C homolog, hlh-4, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, hlh-4 is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in hlh-4 null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that hlh-4 is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor-encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. hlh-4 is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, hlh-14, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an \"ur-\" bHLH gene.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Computational Biology", "Electrical Synapses", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Ontology", "Ion Channels", "Larva", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Neuropeptides", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Nociceptors", "Phenotype", "Receptors, Odorant", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neda", "Last Name": "Masoudi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Glenwinkel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leesun", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kyuhyung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "29429615", "Title": "Sexually Dimorphic unc-6/Netrin Expression Controls Sex-Specific Maintenance of Synaptic Connectivity.", "Abstract": "Nervous systems display intriguing patterns of sexual dimorphisms across the animal kingdom, but the mechanisms that generate such dimorphisms remain poorly characterized.

Although unc-6 is transcribed in the AVG neuron of males and hermaphrodites during juvenile stages, unc-6 expression is downregulated in AVG in hermaphrodites during sexual maturation but is maintained during sexual maturation of males. unc-6 downregulation in hermaphrodites is conferred by the master regulator of hermaphrodite sexual identity, the Gli/CI homolog TRA-1, which antagonizes the non-sex-specific function of the LIM homeobox gene lin-11, a terminal selector and activator of unc-6 in AVG.

In this resource paper, we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244 members of the largest gene family in the C. elegans genome, rhodopsin-like (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic gfp reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system. Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history.

Under specific circumstances repetitive DNA sequences can escape such silencing. For example, exogenously added, extrachromosomal DNA sequences that are stably inherited in multicopy repetitive arrays in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are frequently silenced in the germline, whereas such silencing often does not occur in the soma. This indicates that somatic cells might utilize factors that prevent repetitive DNA silencing. Indeed, such \"antisilencing\" factors have been revealed through genetic screens that identified mutant loci in which repetitive transgenic arrays are aberrantly silenced in the soma. We describe here a novel locus, pals-22 (for protein containing ALS2CR12 signature), required to prevent silencing of repetitive transgenes in neurons and other somatic tissue types. pals-22 deficiency also severely impacts animal vigor and confers phenotypes reminiscent of accelerated aging. We find that pals-22 is a member of a large family of divergent genes (39 members), defined by homology to the ALS2CR12 protein family. While gene family members are highly divergent, they show striking patterns of chromosomal clustering. The family expansion appears C. elegans-specific and has not occurred to the same extent in other nematode species for which genome sequences are available. The transgene-silencing phenotype observed upon loss of PALS-22 protein depends on the biogenesis of small RNAs.

In this resource paper, we provide a comprehensive atlas of neurotransmitters used in the nervous system of the male and compare it to that of the hermaphrodite. Among the three major neurotransmitter systems, acetylcholine (ACh) is the most frequently used, followed by glutamate (Glu), and lastly \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Many male-specific neurons utilize multiple neurotransmitter systems. Interestingly, we find that neurons that are present in both sexes alter their neurotransmitter usage depending on the sex of the animal. One neuron scales up its usage of ACh, another becomes serotonergic in males, and another one adds a new neurotransmitter (glutamate) to its nonsex-specific transmitter (ACh). In all these cases, neurotransmitter changes are correlated with substantial changes in synaptic connectivity. We assembled the neurotransmitter maps of the male-specific nervous system into a comprehensive atlas that describes the anatomical position of all the neurons of the male-specific nervous system relative to the sex-shared nervous system.

Whether and how these two processes are coordinated is poorly understood. Transcription factors called terminal selectors activate identity-specific effector genes during neuronal differentiation to define the structural and functional properties of a neuron. To study restriction of plasticity, we ectopically expressed C. elegans CHE-1, a terminal selector of ASE sensory neuron identity. In undifferentiated cells, ectopic expression of CHE-1 results in activation of ASE neuron type-specific effector genes. Once cells differentiate, their plasticity is restricted and ectopic expression of CHE-1 no longer results in activation of ASE effector genes. In striking contrast, removal of the respective terminal selectors of other sensory, inter-, or motor neuron types now enables ectopically expressed CHE-1 to activate its ASE-specific effector genes, indicating that terminal selectors not only activate effector gene batteries but also control the restriction of cellular plasticity. Terminal selectors mediate this restriction at least partially by organizing chromatin. The chromatin structure of a CHE-1 target locus is less compact in neurons that lack their resident terminal selector and genetic epistasis studies with H3K9 methyltransferases suggest that this chromatin modification acts downstream of a terminal selector to restrict plasticity.

One aspect of nervous system development that has been among the most extensively studied in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is the nature of the gene regulatory programs that specify hardwired, terminal cellular identities. I first summarize a number of maps (anatomical, functional, and molecular) that describe the terminal identity of individual neurons in the C. elegans nervous system. I then provide a comprehensive summary of regulatory factors that specify terminal identities in the nervous system, synthesizing these past studies into a regulatory map of cellular identities in the C. elegans nervous system. This map shows that for three quarters of all neurons in the C. elegans nervous system, regulatory factors that control terminal identity features are known. In-depth studies of specific neuron types have revealed that regulatory factors rarely act alone, but rather act cooperatively in neuron-type specific combinations. In most cases examined so far, distinct, biochemically unlinked terminal identity features are coregulated via cooperatively acting transcription factors, termed terminal selectors, but there are also cases in which distinct identity features are controlled in a piecemeal fashion by independent regulatory inputs. The regulatory map also illustrates that identity-defining transcription factors are reemployed in distinct combinations in different neuron types. However, the same transcription factor can drive terminal differentiation in neurons that are unrelated by lineage, unrelated by function, connectivity and neurotransmitter deployment. Lastly, the regulatory map illustrates the preponderance of homeodomain transcription factors in the control of terminal identities, suggesting that these factors have ancient, phylogenetically conserved roles in controlling terminal neuronal differentiation in the nervous system.

We show here that the spatiotemporal control of synaptic wiring of the D-type neurons is controlled by an intersectional transcriptional strategy in which the UNC-30 Pitx-type homeodomain transcription factor acts together, in embryonic and early larval stages, with the temporally controlled LIN-14 transcription factor to prevent premature synapse rewiring of the DD motor neurons and, together with the UNC-55 nuclear hormone receptor, to prevent aberrant VD synaptic wiring in later larval and adult stages. A key effector of this intersectional transcription factor combination is a novel synaptic organizer molecule, the single immunoglobulin domain protein OIG-1. OIG-1 is perisynaptically localized along the synaptic outputs of the D-type motor neurons in a temporally controlled manner and is required for appropriate selection of both pre- and post-synaptic partners.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Synapses", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Howell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John G", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2015Jul02"}, {"PMID": "26073017", "Title": "Atypical Transcriptional Activation by TCF via a Zic Transcription Factor in C.\u00a0elegans Neuronal Precursors.", "Abstract": "Transcription factors of the TCF family are key mediators of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.

An important unexplored question is whether the process of synaptogenesis is coordinated with the adoption of specific signaling properties of a neuron. Such signaling properties are defined by the neurotransmitter system that a neuron uses to communicate with postsynaptic partners, the neurotransmitter receptor type used to receive input from presynaptic neurons, and, potentially, other sensory receptors that activate a neuron. Elucidating the mechanisms that coordinate synaptogenesis, neuronal activation, and neurotransmitter signaling in a postmitotic neuron represents one key approach to understanding how neurons develop as functional units. Using the SAB class of Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons as a model system, we show here that the phylogenetically conserved COE-type transcription factor UNC-3 is required for synaptogenesis. UNC-3 directly controls the expression of the ADAMTS-like protein MADD-4/Punctin, a presynaptically secreted synapse-organizing molecule that clusters postsynaptic receptors. UNC-3 also controls the assembly of presynaptic specializations and ensures the coordinated expression of enzymes and transporters that define the cholinergic neurotransmitter identity of the SAB neurons. Furthermore, synaptic output properties of the SAB neurons are coordinated with neuronal activation and synaptic input, as evidenced by UNC-3 also regulating the expression of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors and putative stretch receptors.

We decoded the regulatory information that controls the expression of five enzymes and transporters that define the terminal identity of all eight dopaminergic neurons in the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite. We show that the tightly coordinated, robust expression of these dopaminergic enzymes and transporters (\"dopamine pathway\") is ensured through a combinatorial cis-regulatory signature that is shared by all dopamine pathway genes. This signature is composed of an Ets domain-binding site, recognized by the previously described AST-1 Ets domain factor, and two distinct types of homeodomain-binding sites that act in a partially redundant manner. Through genetic screens, we identified the sole C. elegans Distalless/Dlx ortholog, ceh-43, as a factor that acts through one of the homeodomain sites to control both induction and maintenance of terminal dopaminergic fate. The second type of homeodomain site is a Pbx-type site, which is recognized in a partially redundant and neuron subtype-specific manner by two Pbx factors, ceh-20 and ceh-40, revealing novel roles of Pbx factors in the context of terminal neuron differentiation. Taken together, we revealed a specific regulatory signature and cognate, terminal selector-type transcription factors that define the entire dopaminergic nervous system of an animal. Dopaminergic neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb express a similar combinatorial transcription factor collective of Ets/Dlx/Pbx factors, suggesting deep phylogenetic conservation of dopaminergic regulatory programs.", "Keywords": ["cis-regulatory motif", "differentiation", "dopamine", "elegans", "homeodomain", "neuron"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nervous System", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Doitsidou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA. maria.doitsidou@uis.no"}, {"First Name": "Nuria", "Last Name": "Flames", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irini", "Last Name": "Topalidou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Namiko", "Last Name": "Abe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terry", "Last Name": "Felton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Remesal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Popovitchenko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Chalfie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23695300", "Title": "Defining specificity determinants of cGMP mediated gustatory sensory transduction in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "Abstract": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a key secondary messenger used in signal transduction in various types of sensory neurons. The importance of cGMP in the ASE gustatory receptor neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was deduced by the observation that multiple receptor-type guanylyl cyclases (rGCs), encoded by the gcy genes, and two presently known cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel subunits, encoded by the tax-2 and tax-4 genes, are essential for ASE-mediated gustatory behavior. We describe here specific mechanistic features of cGMP-mediated signal transduction in the ASE neurons. First, we assess the specificity of the sensory functions of individual rGC proteins. We have previously shown that multiple rGC proteins are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner in the functionally lateralized ASE neurons and are required to sense distinct salt cues. Through domain swap experiments among three different rGC proteins, we show here that the specificity of individual rGC proteins lies in their extracellular domains and not in their intracellular, signal-transducing domains. Furthermore, we find that rGC proteins are also sufficient to confer salt sensory responses to other neurons. Both findings support the hypothesis that rGC proteins are salt receptor proteins. Second, we identify a novel, likely downstream effector of the rGC proteins in gustatory signal transduction, a previously uncharacterized cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel, encoded by the che-6 locus. che-6 mutants show defects in gustatory sensory transduction that are similar to defects observed in animals lacking the tax-2 and tax-4 CNG channels. In contrast, thermosensory signal transduction, which also requires tax-2 and tax-4, does not require che-6, but requires another CNG, cng-3. We propose that CHE-6 may form together with two other CNG subunits, TAX-2 and TAX-4, a gustatory neuron-specific heteromeric CNG channel complex.", "Keywords": ["C. elegans", "gcy genes", "gustation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Chemoreceptor Cells", "Chemotaxis", "Cyclic GMP", "Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels", "Guanylate Cyclase", "Ion Channels", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Signal Transduction", "Sodium Chloride", "Taste"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heidi K", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linjiao", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Damien", "Last Name": "O'Halloran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dagang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xin-Yun", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aravinthan D T", "Last Name": "Samuel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23457234", "Title": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex selectively affects multiple aspects of serotonergic neuron differentiation.", "Abstract": "Regulatory programs that control the specification of serotonergic neurons have been investigated by genetic mutant screens in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of a previously uncloned gene, ham-3, affects migration and serotonin antibody staining of the hermaphrodite-specific neuron (HSN) pair. We characterize these defects here in more detail, showing that the defects in serotonin antibody staining are paralleled by a loss of the transcription of all genes involved in serotonin synthesis and transport. This loss is specific to the HSN class as other serotonergic neurons appear to differentiate normally in ham-3 null mutants. Besides failing to migrate appropriately, the HSNs also display axon pathfinding defects in ham-3 mutants. However, the HSNs are still generated and express a subset of their terminal differentiation features in ham-3 null mutants, demonstrating that ham-3 is a specific regulator of select features of the HSNs. We show that ham-3 codes for the C. elegans ortholog of human BAF60, Drosophila Bap60, and yeast Swp73/Rsc6, which are subunits of the yeast SWI/SNF and vertebrate BAF chromatin remodeling complex. We show that the effect of ham-3 on serotonergic fate can be explained by ham-3 regulating the expression of the Spalt/SALL-type Zn finger transcription factor sem-4, a previously identified regulator of serotonin expression in HSNs and of the ham-2 Zn transcription factor, a previously identified regulator of HSN migration and axon outgrowth.
