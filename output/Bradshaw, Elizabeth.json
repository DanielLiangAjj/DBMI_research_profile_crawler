[{"PMID": "38948777", "Title": "The Role of Alpha-Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria-ER Membranes.", "Abstract": "The protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that \u03b1Syn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that \u03b1Syn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that \u03b1Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that \u03b1Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Barbuti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Guardia-Laguarta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taekyung", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zena K", "Last Name": "Chatila", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xena", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruno Fr", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone B", "Last Name": "Larsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nobutaka", "Last Name": "Hattori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ulf", "Last Name": "Dettmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saranna", "Last Name": "Fanning", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manon", "Last Name": "Vilas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasini", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rejko", "Last Name": "Kr\u00fcger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun17"}, {"PMID": "38645234", "Title": "IL-1RA Disrupts ATP Activation of P2RX7 in Human Monocyte-Derived Microglia-like Cells.", "Abstract": "The immune system has a dynamic role in neurodegenerative diseases, and purinergic receptors allow immune cells to recognize neuronal signaling, cell injury, or stress. Purinergic Receptor 7 (P2RX7) can modulate inflammatory cascades and its expression is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. P2RX7 expression is enriched in microglia, and elevated levels are found in microglia surrounding amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. While P2RX7 is thought to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, how it modulates pathology and disease progression is not well understood. Here, we utilize a human monocyte-derived microglia-like cell (MDMi) model to interrogate P2RX7 activation and downstream consequences on microglia function. By using MDMi derived from human donors, we can examine how human donor variation impacts microglia function. We assessed P2RX7-driven IL1\u03b2 and IL18 production and amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (A\u03b21-42) uptake levels. Our results show that ATP-stimulation of MDMi triggers upregulation of IL1\u03b2 and IL18 expression. This upregulation of cytokine gene expression is blocked with the A740003 P2RX7 antagonist. We find that high extracellular ATP conditions also reduced MDMi capacity for A\u03b21-42 uptake, and this loss of function is prevented through A740003 inhibition of P2RX7. In addition, pretreatment of MDMi with IL-1RA limited ATP-driven IL1\u03b2 and IL18 gene expression upregulation, indicating that ATP immunomodulation of P2RX7 is IL-1R dependent. A\u03b21-42 uptake was higher with IL-1RA pretreatment compared to ATP treatment alone, suggesting P2RX7 regulates phagocytic engulfment through IL-1 signaling. Overall, our results demonstrate that P2RX7 is a key response protein for high extracellular ATP in human microglia-like cells, and its function can be modulated by IL-1 signaling. This work opens the door to future studies examining anti-IL-1 biologics to increase the clearance of amyloid-beta.", "Keywords": ["ATP", "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease", "Amyloid-beta", "IL-1RA", "Neurodegeneration", "P2RX7"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kelsey", "Last Name": "Heavener", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Departments of Neurology Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Khushbu", "Last Name": "Kabra", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Departments of Neurology Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maedot", "Last Name": "Yidenk", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Departments of Neurology Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Departments of Neurology Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr12"}, {"PMID": "38343836", "Title": "Clonal CD8 T Cells Accumulate in the Leptomeninges and Communicate with Microglia in Human Neurodegeneration.", "Abstract": "Murine studies have highlighted a crucial role for immune cells in the meninges in surveilling the central nervous system (CNS) and influencing neuroinflammation.

There are increasing reports suggesting these microglia found in neurogenic niches differ from their counterparts in non-neurogenic areas. Here, we present evidence that hippocampal microglia exhibit transcriptomic heterogeneity, with some cells expressing genes associated with neurogenesis. By comprehensively profiling myeloid lineage cells in the hippocampus using single cell RNA-sequencing, we have uncovered a small, yet distinct population of microglia which exhibit depletion in genes associated with homeostatic microglia and enrichment of genes associated with phagocytosis.

Advancing the understanding of coronary microstructure-based mechanics is fundamental for the development of therapeutic tools and surgical procedures. Although the passive biaxial properties of the coronary arteries have been extensively explored, their regional differences and the relationship between tissue microstructure and mechanics have not been fully characterized. In this study, we characterized the passive biaxial mechanical properties and microstructural properties of the proximal, medial, and distal regions of the porcine left anterior descending artery (LADA). We also attempted to relate the biaxial stress-stretch response of the LADA and its respective birefringent responses to the polarized light for obtaining information about the load-dependent microstructural variations. We found that the LADA extensibility is reduced in the proximal-to-distal direction and that the medial region exhibits more heterogeneous mechanical behavior than the other two regions. We have also observed highly dynamic microstructural behavior where fiber families realign themselves depending on loading. In addition, we found that the microstructure of the distal region exhibited highly aligned fibers along the longitudinal axis of the artery. To verify this microstructural feature, we imaged the LADA specimens with multi-photon microscopy and observed that the adventitia microstructure transitioned from a random fiber network in the proximal region to highly aligned fibers in the distal region. Our findings could offer new perspectives for understanding coronary mechanics and aid in the development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts, which are currently limited due to their mismatch with native tissue in terms of mechanical properties and microstructural features.

These therapeutics require a deep understanding of arterial mechanics, microstructure, and mechanobiology to prevent graft failure and reoperation. The present study characterizes the unique regional mechanical and microstructural properties of the porcine left anterior descending artery using biaxial testing, polarized-light imaging, and confocal microscopy.

Besides pathological approaches, unbiased evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene network analysis implicate genes expressed in microglia that reduce phagocytic ability as susceptibility genes for AD. Thus, a central feature toward AD therapy is to increase the microglial phagocytic activities while maintaining synaptic integrity. Here, we developed a robust unbiased high content screening assay to identify potential therapeutics which can reduce the amyloid-beta (A\u03b21-42) load by increasing microglial uptake ability. Our screen identified the small-molecule GW5074, an inhibitor of c-RAF, a serine/threonine kinase, which significantly increased the A\u03b21-42 clearance activities in human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells, a microglia culture model that recapitulates many genetic and phenotypic aspects of human microglia. Notably, GW5074 was previously reported to be neuroprotective for cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons. We found that GW5074 significantly increased the expression of key AD-associated microglial molecules known to modulate phagocytosis: TYROBP, SIRP\u03b21, and TREM2.

The Triathlon\u00ae prosthesis (Stryker, Limerick, Ireland), one of the most commonly used total condylar knee prosthesis, is designed to provide greater knee motion and the potential for longer implant survivorship. The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate outcomes and survivorship of the Triathlon\u00a0total knee replacement (TKR) up to 10 years post-operative. Methods Two-hundred sixty-six (266) patients listed for a Triathlon TKR in one orthopaedic hospital were recruited. Assessments were conducted preoperatively and then at three months and one, two, three, five, seven, and 10 years after surgery. Outcomes assessed included pain, function, knee-related quality of life (QoL), satisfaction, kneeling ability, activity levels, American Knee Society Score, complications, and survivorship. Results Large improvements in patient-reported outcomes were observed in the first three months after surgery, followed by small improvement up to one year post-operative, and then outcomes plateaued up to 10 years post-operative. Satisfaction with overall outcome ranged from 79%-94% over the duration of follow-up. Activity levels and kneeling ability were similar before and after surgery. There was a large improvement in the median American Knee Society score in the first three months post-operative, followed by a small but gradual improvement to 10 years post-operative. Survivorship was 95.4% (95% confidence interval 91.8-97.5%) at 10 years post-operative.

"IL-27: An endogenous constitutive repressor of human monocytes.", "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine that initially was described as being pro-inflammatory and an inducer of T helper (Th)1 cells. In contrast, it has also been described as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in that it suppresses pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and induces anti-inflammatory IL-10 producing T regulatory (Tr)1 cells. While the majority of studies have been focused on the effects of IL-27 on T cells, human antigen-presenting cells express high levels of the IL-27 receptor ex vivo, in addition to being the major producer of IL-27. We report here that human monocytes are repressed by endogenous IL-27, in that the addition of an anti-IL-27 neutralizing antibody increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ex vivo. We observed that neutralizing monocyte-derived IL-27 leads to increased IL-17A production by CD4+ T cells and a down-regulation of the IL-17 modulating ectonucleotidase CD39 on monocytes. The locus that contains the IL27 gene has been linked to susceptibility for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Interestingly, ex vivo monocytes from subjects with T1D produce more IL-27 suggesting this upregulation of IL-27 acts as a negative feedback loop to attempt to counterbalance the pro-inflammatory immune response in the disease state. In summary, we provide evidence that IL-27 is an endogenous regulator of human monocytes and has consequences on CD4+ T cell phenotype, particularly Th17 cells.", "Keywords": ["Autoimmunity", "IL-27", "Monocytes", "T1D", "Th17 cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cell Differentiation", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-17", "Interleukins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Th1 Cells", "Th17 Cells", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Frangieh", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "McHenry", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roxanne", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chun", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, CA 94143, USA; Institute of Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelina", "Last Name": "Bernier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Laffel", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The aim of this study was to determine the most appropriate filter cut-off for acceleration- and force-time data when measuring peak resultant acceleration (PRA) and ground reaction force (PRGRF) during gymnastics landings. Sixteen gymnasts executed backward handsprings and backward somersault landings onto a matted force plate while wearing four inertial measurement units (IMUs). Acceleration- and force-time data were filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth filter at different cut-off frequencies ranging from raw through to 250\u00a0Hz. Residual analysis plots were produced, and the PRGRF and PRA for all IMUs were calculated for each participant and skill at all cut-off frequencies. Descriptive statistics, model II linear regressions and Bland-Altman plots were conducted. Results indicated that a minimum 85\u00a0Hz cut-off is optimal. High cut-off frequencies (>80\u00a0Hz) showed good linear relationships and had minimal mean bias compared with raw values, indicating that either filtered (above ~85\u00a0Hz) or raw signals can be used.

In rodents, sleep disruption causes microglial activation, inhibition of which improves cognition. However, data from humans are lacking. We studied participants in two cohort studies of older persons-the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. We assessed sleep fragmentation by actigraphy and related this to cognitive function, to neocortical microglial marker gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, and to the neocortical density of microglia assessed by immunohistochemistry. Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with higher neocortical expression of genes characteristic of aged microglia, and a higher proportion of morphologically activated microglia, independent of chronological age- and dementia-related neuropathologies. Furthermore, these were, in turn, associated with worse cognition. This suggests that sleep fragmentation is accompanied by accelerated microglial aging and activation, which may partially underlie its association with cognitive impairment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Microglia", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Sleep", "Sleep Deprivation", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kirusanthy", "Last Name": "Kaneshwaran", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Tasaki", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aron S", "Last Name": "Buchman", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew S P", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Toronto, Canada."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31604143", "Title": "A novel Tmem119-tdTomato reporter mouse model for studying microglia in the central nervous system.", "Abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The exact role of microglia in CNS disorders is not clear due to lack of tools to discriminate between microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here, we present a novel reporter mouse model targeting a microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, for studying microglia in health and disease. By placing a reporter cassette (GSG-3xFlag-P2A-tdTomato) between the coding sequence of exon 2 and 3'UTR of the Tmem119 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a Tmem119-tdTomato knock-in mouse strain. Gene expression assay showed no difference of endogenous Tmem119 in the CNS of Tmem119tdTomato/+ relative to wild-type mice. The cells expressing tdTomato were recognized by immunofluorescence staining using commercially available anti-TMEM119 antibodies. Additionally, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry techniques revealed that tdTomato+ cells are detected throughout the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues of Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Aging does not influence TMEM119 expression as tdTomato+ cells were detectable in the CNS of older mice (300 and 540\u202fdays old). Further immunofluorescence characterization shows that tdTomato+ cells colocalize with Iba1+ cells in the brain, but not with neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of brain tissues of adult mice demonstrates that the majority of microglia CD45loCD11b+ cells (96.3%) are tdTomato-positive; and a minority of infiltrating CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (5.3%) are also tdTomato-positive, which we further characterized and found that tdTomato expression is in part of choroid plexus macrophages but not in meningeal and perivascular macrophages. Functionally, using an acute injury model, we measured time-lapse activation of tdTomato-labeled microglia by transcranial two-photon microscopy in live Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice.

Effect sizes for PAM measures are substantial, comparable to that of APOE \u03b54, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and mediation models support an upstream role for microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease via accumulation of tau. Further, we identify a common variant (rs2997325) influencing PAM that also affects in vivo microglial activation measured by [11C]-PBR28 PET in an independent cohort. Thus, our analyses begin to uncover pathways regulating resident neuroinflammation and identify overlaps of PAM's genetic architecture with those of Alzheimer's disease and several other traits.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Apolipoproteins E", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Microglia", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neuropathology", "Phenotype", "Proteomics", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Felsky", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tina", "Last Name": "Roostaei", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwangsik", "Last Name": "Nho", "Affiliation": "Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center, Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 355 West 16th Street, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shannon L", "Last Name": "Risacher", "Affiliation": "Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center, Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 355 West 16th Street, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vlad", "Last Name": "Petyuk", "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Saykin", "Affiliation": "Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center, Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 355 West 16th Street, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. pld2115@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2019Jan24"}, {"PMID": "30670379", "Title": "Injury epidemiology and risk factors in competitive artistic gymnasts: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Artistic gymnastics is reported to have some of the highest injury rates in sports, which limits participation and often involves considerable medical expenses.", "Keywords": ["epidemiology", "gymnastics", "injury prevention", "sporting injuries"], "MeSH terms": ["Athletic Injuries", "Gymnastics", "Humans", "Incidence", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rhiannon A", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "University of Canberra Research Institute of Sport and Exercise, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth J", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Centre for Sport Research, School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nick B", "Last Name": "Ball", "Affiliation": "University of Canberra Research Institute of Sport and Exercise, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Pease", "Affiliation": "Applied Technology and Innovation, Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Wayne", "Last Name": "Spratford", "Affiliation": "University of Canberra Research Institute of Sport and Exercise, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia."}], "Journal": "British journal of sports medicine", "PubDate": "2019Sep"}, {"PMID": "30658051", "Title": "The Epidemiology of Low Back Pain and Injury in Dance: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Dance is a physical pursuit that involves loading the spine through repetitive dynamic movements and lifting tasks.

We developed an in vitro cell model system composed of human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells that recapitulated key aspects of microglia phenotype and function. We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells. We propose that increased LRRK2 gene expression by MDMi cells could be a functional outcome of rs76904798, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the LRKK2 locus that is associated with Parkinson's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Polarity", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Microglia", "Models, Biological", "Monocytes", "Nerve Degeneration", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Isoforms", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katie J", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kruti", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jishu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Replogle", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Frangieh", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Cimpean", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phoebe", "Last Name": "Winn", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "McHenry", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Belinda J", "Last Name": "Kaskow", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gail", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cuerdon", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin D", "Last Name": "Boyd", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Imitola", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neural Stem Cells and Functional Neurogenetics, Departments of Neurology and Neuroscience, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, 333 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. emb2280@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2017Dec20"}, {"PMID": "29257984", "Title": "The prevalence and impact of low back pain in pre-professional and professional dancers: A prospective study.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in pre-professional and professional dancers and its impact on dance participation, care-seeking and medication use.", "Keywords": ["Dance", "Epidemiology", "Pain experience", "Spine"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Dancing", "Female", "Humans", "Low Back Pain", "Male", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher T V", "Last Name": "Swain", "Affiliation": "School of Exercise Science, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, Australia.

Here we have shown that 3 nonsynonymous ITGAM variants that produce defective CD11b associate with elevated levels of type I interferon (IFN-I) in lupus, suggesting a direct link between reduced CD11b activity and the chronically increased inflammatory status in patients. Treatment with the small-molecule CD11b agonist LA1 led to partial integrin activation, reduced IFN-I responses in WT but not CD11b-deficient mice, and protected lupus-prone MRL/Lpr mice from end-organ injury. CD11b activation reduced TLR-dependent proinflammatory signaling in leukocytes and suppressed IFN-I signaling via an AKT/FOXO3/IFN regulatory factor 3/7 pathway. TLR-stimulated macrophages from CD11B SNP carriers showed increased basal expression of IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and IFN-\u03b2, as well as increased nuclear exclusion of FOXO3, which was suppressed by LA1-dependent activation of CD11b.

Whereas Tiam1 genetic deficiency weakens IL-17A expression partially and inhibits the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), deletion of Rac1 in T cells exhibits more robust effects on Th17 cells and EAE. We demonstrate Tiam1 and Rac1 form a complex with ROR\u03b3t in the nuclear compartment of Th17 cells, and together bind and activate the Il17 promoter. The clinical relevance of these findings is emphasized by pharmacological targeting of Rac1 that suppresses both murine and human Th17 cells as well as EAE.

The recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) is a transcriptional repressor, but converts into a transcriptional activator upon activation of the canonical Notch pathway. Genome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identified a susceptibility locus, rs874040(CC), which implicated the RBPJ gene. Here, chromatin state mapping generated using the chromHMM algorithm reveals strong enhancer regions containing DNase I hypersensitive sites overlapping the rs874040 linkage disequilibrium block in human memory, but not in na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells. The rs874040 overlapping this chromatin state was associated with increased RBPJ expression in stimulated memory CD4(+) T cells from healthy subjects homozygous for the risk allele (CC) compared with memory CD4(+) T cells bearing the protective allele (GG). Transcriptomic analysis of rs874040(CC) memory T cells showed a repression of canonical Notch target genes IL (interleukin)-9, IL-17 and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 in the basal state. Interestingly, activation of the Notch pathway using soluble Notch ligand, Jagged2-Fc, induced IL-9 and IL-17A while delta-like 4Fc, another Notch ligand, induced higher IFN\u03b3 expression in the rs874040(CC) memory CD4(+) T cells compared with their rs874040(GG) counterparts. In RA, RBPJ expression is elevated in memory T cells from RA patients compared with control subjects, and this was associated with induced inflammatory cytokines IL-9, IL-17A and IFN\u03b3 in response to Notch ligation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that the rs874040(CC) allele skews memory T cells toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype involving Notch signaling, thus increasing the susceptibility to develop RA.",

Thirteen published studies were retained for review. Results indicated that there is a high incidence of lower extremity overuse injuries in the target population. Primary risk factors identified included maturation, growth, and poor lower extremity alignment. Strong evidence from well-designed studies indicates that young elite female ballet dancers suffer from delayed onset of growth, maturation, menarche, and menstrual irregularities. However, there is little evidence that this deficit increases the risk of overuse injury, with the exception of stress fractures. Similarly, there is minimal evidence linking poor lower extremity alignment to increased risk of overuse injury.

We report that the risk allele, rs3865444(C), is associated with greater cell surface expression of CD33 in both subjects of European and African-American ancestry and that there is a single haplotype influencing CD33 surface expression. A meta-analysis of the two populations narrowed the number of significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) > 0.8) with rs3865444 to just five putative causal variants associated with increased protein expression. Using gene expression data from flow-sorted CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes from 398 healthy subjects of three populations, we show that the rs3865444(C) risk allele is strongly associated with greater expression of CD33 exon 2 (pMETA = 2.36 \u00d7 10(-60)).

Of the variants in strong LD with rs3865444, rs12459419, which is located in a putative SRSF2 splice site of exon 2, is the most likely candidate to mediate the altered alternative splicing of CD33's Immunoglobulin V-set domain 2 and ultimately influence AD susceptibility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Alternative Splicing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Case-Control Studies", "Exons", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Isoforms", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Towfique", "Last Name": "Raj", "Affiliation": "Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Institute for the Neurosciences, Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katie J", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Replogle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lori B", "Last Name": "Chibnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Rosenkrantz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katie", "Last Name": "Rothamel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barbara E", "Last Name": "Stranger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Denis A", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2014May15"}, {"PMID": "23708142", "Title": "CD33 Alzheimer's disease locus: altered monocyte function and amyloid biology.", "Abstract": "In our functional dissection of the CD33 Alzheimer's disease susceptibility locus, we found that the rs3865444(C) risk allele was associated with greater cell surface expression of CD33 in the monocytes (t50 = 10.06, P(joint) = 1.3 \u00d7 10(-13)) of young and older individuals.

Through these functions they are able to regulate important phenotypic properties including virulence, secondary metabolism and stress resistance. However the set of NAPs known within the Actinobacteria is small and incomplete. The missing proteins are likely to be key regulators of virulence in pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and also of development and secondary metabolism in industrially-important species such as Streptomyces. Here, we use label-free LC-MS/MS to systematically search for novel NAPs in isolated nucleoids of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor. Based on the criteria of high abundance (emPAI score) and predicted DNA-binding ability (DNAbinder score) we identified a set of 24 proteins with a high predicted likelihood of being NAPs. The approach was deemed successful as the set included known major NAPs HupA, HupS, sIHF and Lsr2 as well as the global transcriptional regulators BldD and CRP and the pleiotropic response regulator AfsQ1. It also included a number of proteins whose functions are not yet known from recognisable classes of transcription factor (SCO2140, SCO4493, SCO1839, SCO1210, SCO5405, SCO4229, SCO3198) or from uncharacterised protein families (SCO5783, SCO5592, SCO3793, SCO6482) which comprise a valuable set of candidates for further study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Streptomyces coelicolor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK.

Reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient, coefficient of variation, mean differences, and Cohen's effect sizes. There was good reliability for vertical stiffness, moderate reliability for leg stiffness, and poor reliability for knee and ankle stiffness during the running task. Similar results were observed during the 2.2 Hz hopping tasks, with good reliability displayed for vertical stiffness and poor reliability for ankle and knee stiffness. In conclusion, our results suggest that vertical stiffness is a reliable measure when running at 3.83 m/s and hopping at 2.2 Hz.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Ankle Joint", "Computer Simulation", "Elastic Modulus", "Gait", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Leg", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Reproducibility of Results", "Running", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Corey W", "Last Name": "Joseph", "Affiliation": "Centre for Physical Activity Across the Lifespan, School of Exercise Science, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth J", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Kemp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ross A", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of applied biomechanics", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "22790314", "Title": "False-negative pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease: the case for parent education.", "Abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics recently published evidence-based guidelines for a standardized approach to pulse oximetry as a screening tool for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD).
