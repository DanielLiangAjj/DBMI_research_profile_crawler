apnea.", "Abstract": "The incidence of syncope during orthostasis increases in early human pregnancy, which may be associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation in the upright posture. In addition, obesity and/or sleep apnea per se may influence CBF regulation due to their detrimental impacts on cerebrovascular function. However, it is unknown whether early pregnant women with obesity and/or sleep apnea could have impaired CBF regulation in the supine position and whether this impairment would be further exacerbated in the upright posture. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) was evaluated using transfer function analysis in 33 women during early pregnancy (13 with obesity, 8 with sleep apnea, 12 with normal weight) and 15 age-matched nonpregnant women during supine rest. Pregnant women also underwent a graded head-up tilt (30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 for 6\u00a0min each). We found that pregnant women with obesity or sleep apnea had a higher transfer function low-frequency gain compared with nonpregnant women in the supine position (P\u2009=\u20090.026 and 0.009, respectively) but not normal-weight pregnant women (P\u2009=\u20090.945). Conversely, the transfer function low-frequency phase in all pregnancy groups decreased during head-up tilt (P\u2009=\u20090.001), but the phase was not different among pregnant groups (P\u2009=\u20090.180). These results suggest that both obesity and sleep apnea may have a detrimental effect on dynamic CA in the supine position during early pregnancy. CBF may be more vulnerable to spontaneous blood pressure fluctuations in early pregnant women during orthostatic stress compared with supine rest due to less efficient dynamic CA, regardless of obesity and/or sleep apnea.", "Keywords": ["Head-up tilt", "Middle cerebral artery", "Orthostatic stress", "Sleep apnea", "Transfer function analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Pregnancy", "Blood Pressure", "Posture", "Sleep Apnea Syndromes", "Homeostasis", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Obesity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Takuro", "Last Name": "Washio", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah L", "Last Name": "Hissen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryosuke", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kazumasa", "Last Name": "Manabe", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "Akins", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Belinda", "Last Name": "Sanchez", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew W", "Last Name": "D'Souza", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Safia", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tony G", "Last Name": "Babb", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 7232 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75231, USA. qifu@texashealth.org."}], "Journal": "Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "37030529", "Title": "Reducing Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure During Exercise Exacerbates Exertional Dyspnea in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: Implications for V\u02d9/Q\u02d9 Mismatch.", "Abstract": "The primary cause of dyspnea on exertion in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is presumed to be the marked rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise; however, this hypothesis has never been tested directly.

Because the respiratory effects of obesity are not homogenous among all individuals with obesity and obesity-related effects could vary depending on the magnitude of obesity, we hypothesized that the exercise ventilatory response (slope of the V\u0307e and carbon dioxide elimination [V\u0307co2] relationship) would manifest itself differently as the magnitude of obesity increases.Objectives: To investigate the V\u0307e/V\u0307co2 slope in an obese population that spanned across a wide body mass index (BMI) range.Methods: A total of 533 patients who presented to a surgical weight loss center for pre-bariatric surgery testing performed an incremental maximal cycling test and were studied retrospectively. The V\u0307e/V\u0307co2 slope was calculated up to the ventilatory threshold. Patients were examined in groups based on BMI (category 1: 30-39.9 kg/m2, category 2: 40-49.9 kg/m2, and category 3: \u226550 kg/m2). Because the respiratory effects of obesity could be sex and/or age specific, we further examined patients in groups by sex and age (younger: <50 yr and older: \u226550 yr). Differences in the V\u0307e/V\u0307co2 slope were then compared between BMI category, age, and sex using a three-way ANOVA.Results: No significant BMI category by sex by age interactions was detected (P\u2009=\u20090.75). The V\u0307e/V\u0307co2 slope decreased with increases in BMI (category 1, 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0; category 2, 28.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1; and category 3, 27.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3) and was elevated in women (28.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1) compared with men (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2) (BMI category by sex interaction, P\u2009<\u20090.05). No age-related differences were observed (BMI category by age interaction, P\u2009=\u20090.55). The partial pressure for end-tidal CO2 was elevated at the ventilatory threshold in BMI category 3 compared with BMI categories 1 and 2 (both P\u2009<\u20090.01).Conclusions: These findings suggest that obesity presents a unique challenge to augmenting ventilatory output relative to CO2 elimination, such that the increase in the exercise ventilatory response becomes blunted as the magnitude of obesity increases.

Other Drosophila photoreceptors are specified by the action of another RTK; the Drosophila EGF Receptor (DER). Why Sev is required specifically in the R7 precursor, and the exact role it plays in the cell's fate assignment have long remained unclear. Notch (N) signaling plays many roles in R7 specification, one of which is to prevent DER activity from establishing the photoreceptor fate. Our current model of Sev function is that it hyperactivates the RTK pathway in the R7 precursor to overcome the N-imposed block on photoreceptor specification. From this perspective DER and Sev are viewed as engaging the same transduction machinery, the only difference between them being the level of pathway activation that they induce. To test this model, we generated a Sev/DER chimera in which the intracellular domain of Sev is replaced with that of DER. This chimerical receptor acts indistinguishably from Sev itself; a result that is entirely consistent with the two RTKs sharing identical transduction abilities. A long-standing question in regard to Sev is the function of a hydrophobic domain some 60 amino acids from the initiating Methionine. If this represents a transmembrane domain, it would endow Sev with N-terminal intracellular sequences through which it could engage internal transduction pathways. However, we find that this domain acts as an internal signal peptide, and that there is no Sev N-terminal intracellular domain. phyllopod (phyl) is the target gene of the RTK pathway, and we show that R7 precursors are selectively lost when phyl gene function is mildly compromised, and that other photoreceptors are removed when the gene function is further reduced. This result adds a key piece of evidence for the hyperactivation of the RTK pathway in the R7 precursor. To facilitate the hyperactivation of the RTK pathway, Sev is expressed at high levels. However, when we express DER at the levels at which Sev is expressed, strong gain-of-function effects result, consistent with ligand-independent activation of the receptor. This highlights another key feature of Sev; that it is expressed at high levels yet remains strictly ligand dependent. Finally, we find that activated Sev can rescue R3/4 photoreceptors when their DER function is abrogated. These results are collectively consistent with Sev and DER activating the same transduction machinery, with Sev generating a pathway hyperactivation to overcome the N-imposed block to photoreceptor specification in R7 precursors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "ErbB Receptors", "Eye", "Eye Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Phosphorylation", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Receptors, Notch", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Jerome L.

R7 is derived from a group of cells that also gives rise to the R1/6 photoreceptor class and the non-photoreceptor cone cells. Our studies examine the signals and cellular information that direct each of these cell types. The cell fates are directed by the combined actions of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. The RTK pathway acts to remove the transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) which represses the photoreceptor fate. If a cell receives an RTK signal sufficient to remove Ttk then the photoreceptor fate is specified; if not, the cone cell fate results. If Ttk is removed from a cell and its N activity is high then it is specified as an R7, but if its N activity is low then it becomes an R1/6 class photoreceptor. Thus, a remarkably simple molecular code underlies the specification of the fates: 1. Ttk degraded or not: 2. N activity high or low. In the R1/6 and cone cell precursors the molecular codes are achieved with relative simplicity but in the R7 precursor, manifold interactions occur between the RTK and N pathways, and to-date we have identified 4 distinct roles played by N in R7 fate specification. In this review we detail this molecular complexity, and describe how the RTK/N pathway crosstalk eventually leads to the simple molecular code of Tramtrack removed and N activity high.

The transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) inhibits photoreceptor assignment, and previous studies found that the RTK-induced degradation of Ttk was critically required for R7 specification.

Dpn expression needs to be tightly restricted to R7 precursors, and we describe the role played by Ttk in repressing dpn transcription. Thus, Dpn and Ttk act as mutually repressive transcription factors, with Dpn acting to ensure that Ttk is effectively removed from R7, and Ttk acting to prevent Dpn expression in other cells.

Here we examine how a Wingless (Wg) morphogen gradient patterns the peripheral specialization of the fly eye. The outermost specialization is the pigment rim; a thick band of pigment cells that circumscribes the eye and optically insulates the sides of the retina. It results from the coalescence of pigment cells that survive the death of the outermost row of developing ommatidia. We investigate here how the Wg target genes expressed in the moribund ommatidia direct the intercellular signaling, the morphogenetic movements, and ultimately the ommatidial death. A salient feature of this process is the secondary expression of the Wg morphogen elicited in the ommatidia by the primary Wg signal. We find that neither the primary nor secondary sources of Wg alone are able to promote ommatidial death, but together they suffice to drive the apoptosis. This represents an unusual gradient read-out process in which a morphogen induces its own expression in its target cells to generate a concentration spike required to push the local cellular responses to the next threshold response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Body Patterning", "Compound Eye, Arthropod", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Pupa", "RNA Interference", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Signal Transduction", "Snail Family Transcription Factors", "Transcription Factors", "Wnt1 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sudha R", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development College of Physicians and Surgeons Columbia University, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hina", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development College of Physicians and Surgeons Columbia University, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development College of Physicians and Surgeons Columbia University, United States.

A proline to leucine substitution at PrP residue 102 (P102L) is classically associated with Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease but shows marked clinical and neuropathological variability within kindreds that may be caused by variable propagation of distinct prion strains generated from either PrP 102L or wild type PrP. To-date the transmission properties of prions propagated in P102L patients remain ill-defined. Multiple mouse models of GSS have focused on mutating the corresponding residue of murine PrP (P101L), however murine PrP 101L, a novel PrP primary structure, may not have the repertoire of pathogenic prion conformations necessary to accurately model the human disease. Here we describe the transmission properties of prions generated in human PrP 102L expressing transgenic mice that were generated after primary challenge with ex vivo human GSS P102L or classical CJD prions. We show that distinct strains of prions were generated in these mice dependent upon source of the inoculum (either GSS P102L or CJD brain) and have designated these GSS-102L and CJD-102L prions, respectively. GSS-102L prions have transmission properties distinct from all prion strains seen in sporadic and acquired human prion disease. Significantly, GSS-102L prions appear incapable of transmitting disease to conventional mice expressing wild type mouse PrP, which contrasts strikingly with the reported transmission properties of prions generated in GSS P102L-challenged mice expressing mouse PrP 101L. We conclude that future transgenic modeling of IPDs should focus exclusively on expression of mutant human PrP, as other approaches may generate novel experimental prion strains that are unrelated to human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Prions"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emmanuel A", "Last Name": "Asante", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Grimshaw", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Smidak", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Jakubcova", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Asif", "Last Name": "Jeelani", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Shyma", "Last Name": "Hamdan", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline M", "Last Name": "Linehan", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Brandner", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D F", "Last Name": "Wadsworth", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Collinge", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "26061765", "Title": "A naturally occurring variant of the human prion protein completely prevents prion disease.", "Abstract": "Mammalian prions, transmissible agents causing lethal neurodegenerative diseases, are composed of assemblies of misfolded cellular prion protein (PrP). A novel PrP variant, G127V, was under positive evolutionary selection during the epidemic of kuru--an acquired prion disease epidemic of the Fore population in Papua New Guinea--and appeared to provide strong protection against disease in the heterozygous state. Here we have investigated the protective role of this variant and its interaction with the common, worldwide M129V PrP polymorphism. V127 was seen exclusively on a M129 PRNP allele. We demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing both variant and wild-type human PrP are completely resistant to both kuru and classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prions (which are closely similar) but can be infected with variant CJD prions, a human prion strain resulting from exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions to which the Fore were not exposed. Notably, mice expressing only PrP V127 were completely resistant to all prion strains, demonstrating a different molecular mechanism to M129V, which provides its relative protection against classical CJD and kuru in the heterozygous state. Indeed, this single amino acid substitution (G\u2192V) at a residue invariant in vertebrate evolution is as protective as deletion of the protein. Further study in transgenic mice expressing different ratios of variant and wild-type PrP indicates that not only is PrP V127 completely refractory to prion conversion but acts as a potent dose-dependent inhibitor of wild-type prion propagation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Cattle", "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome", "Encephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Kuru", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Papua New Guinea", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "PrPSc Proteins", "Prion Diseases", "Prions"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emmanuel A", "Last Name": "Asante", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Smidak", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Grimshaw", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Houghton", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Asif", "Last Name": "Jeelani", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Jakubcova", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Shyma", "Last Name": "Hamdan", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Richard-Londt", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline M", "Last Name": "Linehan", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Brandner", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Alpers", "Affiliation": "1] MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK [2] Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea."}, {"First Name": "Jerome", "Last Name": "Whitfield", "Affiliation": "1] MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK [2] Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Mead", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D F", "Last Name": "Wadsworth", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Collinge", "Affiliation": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2015Jun25"}, {"PMID": "24086135", "Title": "Inherited prion disease A117V is not simply a proteinopathy but produces prions transmissible to transgenic mice expressing homologous prion protein.", "Abstract": "Prions are infectious agents causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals. In humans, these have sporadic, acquired and inherited aetiologies. The inherited prion diseases are caused by one of over 30 coding mutations in the human prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP) and many of these generate infectious prions as evidenced by their experimental transmissibility by inoculation to laboratory animals. However, some, and in particular an extensively studied type of Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) caused by a PRNP A117V mutation, are thought not to generate infectious prions and instead constitute prion proteinopathies with a quite distinct pathogenetic mechanism. Multiple attempts to transmit A117V GSS have been unsuccessful and typical protease-resistant PrP (PrP(Sc)), pathognomonic of prion disease, is not detected in brain. Pathogenesis is instead attributed to production of an aberrant topological form of PrP, C-terminal transmembrane PrP ((Ctm)PrP). Barriers to transmission of prion strains from one species to another appear to relate to structural compatibility of PrP in host and inoculum and we have therefore produced transgenic mice expressing human 117V PrP. We found that brain tissue from GSS A117V patients did transmit disease to these mice and both the neuropathological features of prion disease and presence of PrP(Sc) was demonstrated in the brains of recipient transgenic mice. This PrP(Sc) rapidly degraded during laboratory analysis, suggesting that the difficulty in its detection in patients with GSS A117V could relate to post-mortem proteolysis.

These developmental cues are mediated through the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways and their combined activities are crucial in specifying cell type. The transcription factor Lozenge (Lz) is expressed exclusively in second wave cells. Here, we ectopically supply Lz to precluster cells and concomitantly supply the various RTK/N codes that specify each of three second wave cell fates. We thereby reproduce molecular markers of each of the second wave cell types in precluster cells and draw three inferences. First, we confirm that Lz provides key intrinsic information to second wave cells. We can now combine this with the RTK/N signaling to provide a cell fate specification code that entails both extrinsic and intrinsic information. Second, the reproduction of each second wave cell type in the precluster confirms the accuracy of the RTK/N signaling code.
