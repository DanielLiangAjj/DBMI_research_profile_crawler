Despite extensive work, the in\u00a0vivo functional allocation and spatial distribution of NusG remain unknown. Using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging in live E.\u00a0coli cells, we found NusG predominantly in a chromosome-associated population (binding to RNA polymerase in elongation complexes) and a slowly diffusing population complexed with the 30S ribosomal subunit; the latter provides a \"30S-guided\" path for NusG into transcription elongation. Only \u223c10% of NusG is fast diffusing, with its mobility suggesting non-specific interactions with DNA for >50% of the time. Antibiotic treatments and deletion mutants revealed that chromosome-associated NusG participates mainly in rrn anti-termination within phase-separated transcriptional condensates and in transcription-translation coupling.

Here, we focus on two recent studies addressing the importance of DksA in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), one by Sivaramakrishnan et al. (Nature 550:214-218, 2017) and one originating in our laboratory, Myka et al. (Mol Microbiol 111:1382-1397. https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14227 , 2019). It appears that depending on the type and possibly location of DNA damage, DksA can play either a passive or an active role in DSB repair. The passive role relies on exclusion of anti-backtracking factors from the RNAP secondary channel. The exact mechanism of active DksA-mediated DNA repair is unknown. However, DksA was proposed to destabilize transcription complexes, thus clearing the way for recombination and DNA repair. Based on the requirement for DksA, both in repair of DSBs and the R-loop-dependent formation of new origins of DNA replication, we propose that DksA may allow for removal of RNAP without unwinding of the RNA:DNA hybrid, which can then be extended by a DNA polymerase. This mechanism obviates the need for RNAP backtracking to repair damaged DNA.", "Keywords": ["(p)ppGpp", "Anti-backtracking factors", "Double-strand break repair", "Nalidixic acid", "Phleomycin", "Replication\u2013transcription conflicts", "Transcription factor DksA", "Type II topoisomerase"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Repair", "DNA Topoisomerases, Type II", "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Guanosine Pentaphosphate", "Nalidixic Acid", "Phleomycins", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kamila K", "Last Name": "Myka", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Max E", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. meg8@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Current genetics", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "30850627", "Title": "RNA Stabilizes Transcription-Dependent Chromatin Loops Induced By Nuclear Hormones.", "Abstract": "We show that transcription induced by nuclear receptors for estrogen (E2) or retinoic acid (RA) is associated with formation of chromatin loops that juxtapose the 5' end (containing the promoter) with the enhancer and the 3' polyA addition site of the target gene.

RA or E2-induced loops which connect the 5' end, the enhancer and the 3' end of the gene, and are stabilized by RNA early after induction; 2. E2-independent loops whose stability does not require RNA; 3. Loops detected only by treatment of chromatin with RNAse H1 prior to hormonal induction. RNAse H1 digests RNA that occludes the relevant restriction sites, thus preventing detection of these loops. R-loops at the 5' and 3' ends of the RA or E2-target genes were demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with anti-DNA-RNA hybrid antibodies as well as by sensitivity to RNAse H1. The cohesin RAD21 subunit is preferentially recruited to the target sites upon RA or E2 induction of transcription. RAD21 binding to chromatin is eliminated by RNAse H1. We identified E2-induced and RNase H1-sensitive antisense RNAs located at the 5' and 3' ends of the E2-induced transcription unit which stabilize the loops and RAD21 binding to chromatin.

This contrarian proposal is based on our studies of nusA and nusB cold-sensitive mutations that have altered translation and at low temperature accumulate 30S subunit precursors. Both phenotypes are suppressed by deletion of RNase III. We argue that these results are consistent with the idea that the nus mutations cause altered rRNA folding that leads to abnormal 30S subunits and slow translation. According to this idea, functional Nus proteins stabilize an RNA loop between their binding sites in the 5' RNA leader and on the transcribing RNA polymerase, providing a topological constraint on the RNA that aids normal rRNA folding and processing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Models, Biological", "Models, Molecular", "Mutant Proteins", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Peptide Elongation Factors", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Ribonuclease III", "Ribosome Subunits, Small", "Temperature", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Transcriptional Elongation Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mikhail", "Last Name": "Bubunenko", "Affiliation": "Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Basic Research Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Frederick, MD 21702, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald L", "Last Name": "Court", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abdalla", "Last Name": "Al Refaii", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shivalika", "Last Name": "Saxena", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexey", "Last Name": "Korepanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David I", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Max E", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Herv\u00e9", "Last Name": "Alix", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular microbiology", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
