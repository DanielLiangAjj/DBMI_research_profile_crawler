However, adequate current for successful DCCV has not yet been established. Transmyocardial current depends on 2 factors: input energy and transthoracic impedance (TTI). Although factors affecting TTI have been studied in animal models, factors affecting TTI in humans have not been well established. Herein, we explored the potential factors that affect TTI in humans. A retrospective review of patients who underwent DCCV at a large quaternary medical center between October 2019 and August 2021 was conducted. Pertinent clinical information, including demographics, echocardiography findings, laboratory findings, and body characteristics, was collected. Cardioversion details, including joules delivered and TTI, were recorded by the defibrillator for each patient's first shock. Predictors of thoracic impedance were assessed using regression analysis. A total of 220 patients (29% women) were included in the analysis; 143 of the patients (65%) underwent DCCV for atrial fibrillation and 77 (35%) underwent DCCV for atrial flutter. The mean impedance in our population was 73 \u00b1 18\u00a0\u03a9. In a regression model with high impedance defined as the upper quartile of our cohort, body mass index (BMI), female sex, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease (all p\u00a0values <0.05) were significantly associated with high impedance. According to a receiver operating characteristic analysis, BMI has a high predictive value for high impedance, with an area under the curve of 0.76. In conclusion, our study reveals that elevated BMI, female sex, sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease were predictors of higher TTI. These factors may help determine the appropriate initial shock energy in patients who underwent DCCV for atrial fibrillation and flutter.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "atrial flutter", "electrical cardioversion", "transthoracic impedance"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Male", "Electric Countershock", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cardiography, Impedance", "Atrial Flutter", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Redel-Traub", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Youssef A", "Last Name": "Elnabawi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Kursat", "Last Name": "Gurel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Saurabh", "Last Name": "Sudesh", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hannah R", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Dizon", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "Biviano", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey A", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Garan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology."}, {"First Name": "Hirad", "Last Name": "Yarmohammadi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology.

There have been new technologies and techniques for atrial fibrillation ablation, including pulsed field ablation. There have been new randomized trials in atrial fibrillation ablation, giving insight about rhythm control, and long-term outcomes. There have been advances in our understanding of treatment of inherited disorders such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. We have gained new insights into the recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of various conditions such as myocarditis and inherited cardiomyopathic disorders. Novel computational approaches may help predict occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and localize arrhythmias to guide ablation. There are further advances in our understanding of noninvasive radiotherapy. We have increased our understanding of the role of His bundle pacing and left bundle branch area pacing to maintain synchronous ventricular activation. There have also been significant advances in the defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, remote monitoring, and infection prevention.

In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Recording and processing of EGM (or ECG) are the cornerstones of (body surface) mapping of AF. Currently available AF recording and processing technologies are mainly restricted to specific applications or have technological limitations. Improvements in AF mapping by obtaining highest fidelity source signals (e.g. catheter-electrode combinations) for signal processing (e.g. filtering, digitization, and noise elimination) is of utmost importance.

understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that facilitate the structural and electrophysiological remodeling that occurs in the atria. Similar to humans, increased persistent Na+ current leads to the development of an atrial myopathy and spontaneous and long-lasting episodes of AF in mice. How increased persistent Na+ current causes both structural and electrophysiological remodeling in the atria is unknown. We crossbred mice expressing human F1759A-NaV1.5 channels with mice expressing human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT). Increased expression of mCAT attenuated mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the structural remodeling that was induced by persistent F1759A-Na+ current. Despite the heterogeneously prolonged atrial action potential, which was unaffected by the reduction in ROS, the incidences of spontaneous AF, pacing-induced after-depolarizations, and AF were substantially reduced. Expression of mCAT markedly reduced persistent Na+ current-induced ryanodine receptor oxidation and dysfunction. In summary, increased persistent Na+ current in atrial cardiomyocytes, which is observed in patients with AF, induced atrial enlargement, fibrosis, mitochondrial dysmorphology, early after-depolarizations, and AF, all of which can be attenuated by resolving mitochondrial oxidative stress.", "Keywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Sodium channels"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cardiomegaly", "Cardiomyopathies", "Catalase", "Crosses, Genetic", "Female", "Heart Atria", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Haikel", "Last Name": "Dridi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Steven R", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amar D", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Haajra", "Last Name": "Baksh", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Parmanand", "Last Name": "Dasrat", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ruiping", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Yejun", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sison", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "W Jonathan", "Last Name": "Lederer", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Humberto C", "Last Name": "Joca", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher W", "Last Name": "Ward", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Greiser", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2021Oct28"}, {"PMID": "34497331", "Title": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter promotes arrhythmias caused by high-fat diet.", "Abstract": "Obesity and diabetes increase the risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. However, the molecular mechanisms of arrhythmia caused by metabolic abnormalities are not well understood. We hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction caused by high fat diet (HFD) promotes ventricular arrhythmia. Based on our previous work showing that saturated fat causes calcium handling abnormalities in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that mitochondrial calcium uptake contributes to HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and arrhythmic events. For experiments, we used mice with conditional cardiac-specific deletion of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (Mcu), which is required for mitochondrial calcium uptake, and littermate controls. Mice were used for in vivo heart rhythm monitoring, perfused heart experiments, and isolated cardiomyocyte experiments. MCU KO mice are protected from HFD-induced long QT, inducible ventricular tachycardia, and abnormal ventricular repolarization. Abnormal repolarization may be due, at least in part, to a reduction in protein levels of voltage gated potassium channels. Furthermore, isolated cardiomyocytes from MCU KO mice exposed to saturated fat are protected from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and abnormal calcium handling. Activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) corresponds with the increase in arrhythmias in vivo. Additional experiments showed that CaMKII inhibition protects cardiomyocytes from the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by saturated fat. Hearts from transgenic CaMKII inhibitor mice were protected from inducible ventricular tachycardia after HFD. These studies identify mitochondrial dysfunction caused by calcium overload as a key mechanism of arrhythmia during HFD. This work indicates that MCU and CaMKII could be therapeutic targets for arrhythmia caused by metabolic abnormalities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Diet, High-Fat", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondria", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leroy C", "Last Name": "Joseph", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael V", "Last Name": "Reyes", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edwin A", "Last Name": "Homan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Blake", "Last Name": "Gowen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris N", "Last Name": "Goulbourne", "Affiliation": "Center for Dementia Research, Nathan S.

The combination of analyses gleaned from studies in swine and canine models of postinfarction reentrant VT, and in human studies, suggests the existence of common electroanatomic properties for reentrant VT circuits.

substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. However, the mechanisms and optimal ablation treatment strategies for such arrhythmias are still unclear. Using 2D optical mapping of a mouse model with AF and VF, we have identified regional heterogeneity of the action potential duration (APD) in the atria and ventricles of the heart as key drivers for the initiation and persistence of reentry. The purpose of this paper is to discuss theoretical patterns of dispersion, demonstrate patterns of dispersion seen in our mouse model and discuss the computational analysis of APD dispersion patterns. These analyses and discussions may lead to better understanding of dispersion patterns in patients with these arrhythmias, as well as help comprehend whether and how reducing dispersion can lead to arrhythmia risk stratification and treatment strategies for arrhythmias.", "Keywords": ["action potential dispersion", "action potential duration", "cardiac arrhythmia", "heart", "optical mapping of calcium and action potentials"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, University of Mississippi, Jackson, MS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lea", "Last Name": "Melki", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jared S", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33685207", "Title": "Management of Arrhythmias After Heart Transplant: Current State and Considerations for Future Research.", "Abstract": "Orthotropic heart transplantation remains the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure, with a median survival of \u224813 years. Yet, a number of complications are observed after orthotropic heart transplantation, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Several factors contribute to arrhythmias, such as autonomic denervation, effect of the surgical technique, acute and chronic rejection, and transplant vasculopathy among others. To minimize risk of future arrhythmias, the bicaval technique and minimizing ischemic time are current surgical standards. Sinus node dysfunction is the most common indication for early (within 30 days) pacemaker implantation, whereas atrioventricular block incidence increases as time from transplant increases. Atrial fibrillation can occur in the first few weeks following transplantation but is uncommon in the long term unless secondary to a precipitant such as acute rejection. The most common atrial arrhythmias are atrial flutters, which are mainly typical, but atypical circuits can be observed such as those that involve the remnant donor atrium in regions immediately adjacent to the atrioatrial anastomosis suture line. Choosing the appropriate pharmacological therapy requires careful consideration due to the potential interaction with immunosuppressive agents. Despite historical concerns, adenosine is effective and safe at reduced doses if administered under cardiac monitoring. Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for symptomatic supraventricular tachycardias, including ablation of atypical flutter circuits. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is an important risk factor for sudden cardiac death, yet the role of prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant for sudden death prevention is unclear. Current indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation are as in the nontransplant population.

The diagnosis of AA was confirmed by 12 lead electrocardiographic recordings, 24-hour telemetry recordings and implantable device interrogations. Patients' history, biomarkers and hospital course were reviewed. Outcomes that were assessed were intubation, discharge and mortality. Of 1,029 patients reviewed, 82 (8%) were diagnosed with AA in whom 46 (56%) were new-onset AA 16 (20%) recurrent paroxysmal and 20 (24%) were chronic persistent AA. Sixty-five percent of the patients diagnosed with AA (n=53) died. Patients diagnosed with AA had significantly higher mortality compared with those without AA (65% vs 21%; p < 0.001). Predictors of mortality were older age (Odds Ratio (OR)=1.12, [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.04 to 1.22]); male gender (OR=6.4 [95% CI, 1.3 to 32]); azithromycin use (OR=13.4 [95% CI, 2.14 to 84]); and higher D-dimer levels (OR=2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.3]). In conclusion, patients diagnosed with AA had 3.1 times significant increase in mortality rate versus patients without diagnosis of AA in COVID-19 patients. Older age, male gender, azithromycin use and higher baseline D-dimer levels were predictors of mortality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrial Fibrillation", "COVID-19", "Comorbidity", "Disease Management", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York", "Pandemics", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "SARS-CoV-2", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hirad", "Last Name": "Yarmohammadi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York.

Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64\u00b117 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST-T wave changes, and initial hs-cTnT \u226520\u00a0ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs-cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Myocardial injury with hs-cTnT \u226520\u00a0ng/L, in addition to cardiac conduction perturbations, especially AF/AFL, upon hospital admission for COVID-19 infection is associated with markedly increased risk for mortality than either diagnostic abnormality alone.", "Keywords": ["COVID\u201019", "arrhythmia", "atrial fibrillation", "troponin"], "MeSH terms": ["Atrial Fibrillation",

Although SARS-CoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. Cardiac arrhythmias are often observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and more likely contribute to the high risk of adverse outcomes. Arrhythmias should be regarded as one of the main complications of COVID-19. Mechanistically, a number of ion channels can be adversely affected in COVID-19, leading to alterations in cardiac conduction and/or repolarization properties, as well as calcium handling, which can predispose to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. In addition, several antimicrobials that are currently used as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have uncertain benefit, and yet may induce electrocardiographic QT prolongation with potential ventricular pro-arrhythmic effects.\u00a0Continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, accurate and prompt recognition of arrhythmias are important.

Here, we identify the role of calmodulin and the NaV1.5 interactome in regulating late Na+ current in cardiomyocytes. We created transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human NaV1.5 channels with alanine substitutions for the IQ motif (IQ/AA). The mutations rendered the channels incapable of binding calmodulin to the C-terminus. The IQ/AA transgenic mice exhibited normal ventricular repolarization without arrhythmias and an absence of increased late Na+ current. In comparison, transgenic mice expressing a lidocaine-resistant (F1759A) human NaV1.5 demonstrated increased late Na+ current and prolonged repolarization in cardiomyocytes, with spontaneous arrhythmias. To determine regulatory factors that prevent late Na+ current for the IQ/AA mutant channel, we considered fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), which are within the NaV1.5 proteomic subdomain shown by proximity labeling in transgenic mice expressing NaV1.5 conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase. We found that FGF13 diminished late current of the IQ/AA but not F1759A mutant cardiomyocytes, suggesting that endogenous FHFs may serve to prevent late Na+ current in mouse cardiomyocytes. Leveraging endogenous mechanisms may furnish an alternative avenue for developing novel pharmacology that selectively blunts late Na+ current.", "Keywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Calmodulin", "Cardiology", "Sodium channels"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium Signaling", "Calmodulin", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Protein Binding", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Roybal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, and."}, {"First Name": "Nourdine", "Last Name": "Chakouri", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Weinberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jessica A", "Last Name": "Hennessey", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chaojian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2020Oct02"}, {"PMID": "32864335", "Title": "Malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 without significant structural heart disease.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Acute respiratory distress syndrome", "Arrhythmia", "COVID-19", "Ventricular fibrillation", "Ventricular tachycardia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark P", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ellie J", "Last Name": "Coromilas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey A", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Garan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose M", "Last Name": "Dizon", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "HeartRhythm case reports", "PubDate": "2020Nov"}, {"PMID": "32861812", "Title": "Cardiac electrophysiology consultative experience at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the practice of cardiac electrophysiology around the world for the foreseeable future.

Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections and ARDS, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. Thus, we sought to determine whether antecedent statin use is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1 st through May 12 th , 2020 with study period ending on June 11 th , 2020. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint included in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, demographic, baseline, and outpatient medication information were well balanced. Statin use was significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 \u00e2\u20ac\" 0.64, p<0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with lower inpatient mortality.

Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

this time. AF is associated with numerous symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue, which can significantly reduce health-related quality of life and result in serious adverse cardiac outcomes. In light of this, the aim of the present pilot study was to test the feasibility of implementing a mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle intervention titled \"Atrial Fibrillation and Cardiac Health: Targeting Improving Outcomes via a Nurse-Led Intervention (ACTION),\" with the goal of improving cardiac health measures, AF symptom recognition, and self-management. As part of this study, participants self-identified cardiac health goals at enrollment. The nurse used web-based resources from the American Heart Association (Dallas, TX, USA), which included the Life's Simple 7\u00ae My Life Check\u00ae assessment, to quantify current lifestyle behavior change needs. Furthermore, on the My AFib Experience\u2122 website (American Heart Association, Dallas, TX, USA), the patient used a symptom tracker tool to capture the date, time, frequency, and type of AF symptoms, and these data were subsequently reviewed by the cardiac nurse. Throughout the six-month intervention period, the cardiac nurse used a motivational interviewing approach to support participants' cardiac health goals. Ultimately, the ACTION intervention was tested in 53 individuals with AF (mean age: 59 \u00b1 11 years; 76% male). Participants were predominantly overweight/obese (79%), had a history of hypertension (62%) or hyperlipidemia (61%), and reported being physically inactive/not preforming any type of regular exercise (52%). The majority (88%) of the participants had one or more Life's Simple 7\u00ae measures that could be improved. Most of the participants (98%) liked having a dedicated nurse to work with them on a biweekly basis via the mHealth portal. The most commonly self-reported symptoms were palpitations, fatigue/exercise intolerance, and dyspnea. Seventy percent of the participants had an improvement in their weight and blood pressure as documented within the electronic health record as well as a corresponding improvement in their Life's Simple 7\u00ae score at six months. On average, there was a three-pound (1.36-kg) decrease in weight and a 5-mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure between baseline and at six months. In conclusion, this pilot work provides initial evidence regarding the feasibility of implementing the ACTION intervention and supports testing the ACTION intervention in a larger cohort of AF patients to inform existing AF guidelines and build an evidence base for reducing AF burden through lifestyle modification.", "Keywords": ["Atrial fibrillation", "nursing", "quality of life",

The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the current noninvasive clinical tool used to diagnose and localize cardiac arrhythmias. However, it has limited accuracy and is subject to operator bias. Here, we present electromechanical wave imaging (EWI), a high-frame rate ultrasound technique that can noninvasively map with high accuracy the electromechanical activation of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in adult patients. This study evaluates the accuracy of EWI for localization of various arrhythmias in all four chambers of the heart before catheter ablation. Fifty-five patients with an accessory pathway (AP) with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), atrial tachycardia (AT), or atrial flutter (AFL) underwent transthoracic EWI and 12-lead ECG. Three-dimensional (3D) rendered EWI isochrones and 12-lead ECG predictions by six electrophysiologists were applied to a standardized segmented cardiac model and subsequently compared to the region of successful ablation on 3D electroanatomical maps generated by invasive catheter mapping. There was significant interobserver variability among 12-lead ECG reads by expert electrophysiologists. EWI correctly predicted 96% of arrhythmia locations as compared with 71% for 12-lead ECG analyses [unadjusted for arrhythmia type: odds ratio (OR), 11.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2 to 63.2; P = 0.004; adjusted for arrhythmia type: OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 2.3 to 63.2; P = 0.003].

During Afib treatment, clinicians aim to repress unusual electrical activity by electrically isolating the pulmonary veins (PV) from the left atrium (LA) using radiofrequency ablation. However, current clinical tools are limited in reliably assessing transmurality of the ablation lesions and detecting the presence of gaps within ablation lines, which can warrant repeat procedures. In this study, we developed an endoscopic multispectral reflectance imaging (eMSI) system for enhanced discrimination of tissue treatment at the PV junction. The system enables direct visualization of cardiac lesions through an endoscope at acquisition rates up to 25 Hz. Five narrowband, high-power LEDs were used to illuminate the sample (450, 530, 625, 810 and 940nm) and combinatory parameters were calculated based on their relative reflectance. A stitching algorithm was employed to generate large field-of-view, multispectral mosaics of the ablated PV junction from individual eMSI images. A total of 79 lesions from 15 swine hearts were imaged, ex vivo. Statistical analysis of the acquired five spectral data sets and ratiometric maps revealed significant differences between transmural lesions, non-transmural lesions around the venoatrial junctions, unablated posterior wall of left atrium tissue, and pulmonary vein (p < 0.0001). A pixel-based quadratic discriminant analysis classifier was applied to distinguish four tissue types: PV, untreated LA, non-transmural and transmural lesions. We demonstrate tissue type classification accuracies of 80.2% and 92.1% for non-transmural and transmural lesions, and 95.0% and 92.8% for PV and untreated LA sites, respectively.

The mice have regional heterogeneity of action potential duration of the atria similar to observations in patients with AF. In these mice, we found that the initiation and persistence of the rotational reentrant AF arrhythmias, known as spiral waves or rotors, were dependent upon action potential duration heterogeneity. The centers of the rotors were localized to regions of greatest heterogeneity of the action potential duration. Pharmacologically attenuating the action potential duration heterogeneity reduced both spontaneous and pacing-induced AF. Computer-based simulations also demonstrated that the action potential duration heterogeneity is sufficient to generate rotors that manifest as AF.

Second, one (n\u202f=\u202f1) adult patient diagnosed with PVC was imaged with EWI before the scheduled RF ablation procedure, and EWI results were compared with mapping procedure results. In dogs, EWI was capable of detecting whether pacing was of endocardial or epicardial origin in six of seven cases (86% success rate). In the PVC patient, EWI correctly identified both regions and surface of origin, as confirmed by results from the electrical mapping obtained from the RF ablation procedure.

In all three dogs, as soon as day 1 EWI was capable of detecting late-activated and non-activated regions, which grew over the next few days. On final day images, the extent of these regions corresponded to the location of infarct as confirmed by staining. EW velocities in border zones of infarct were significantly lower post-infarct formation when compared to baseline, whereas velocities in healthy tissues were not. These results indicate that EWI and EW velocity might help with the detection of infarcts and their border zones, which may be useful for characterizing arrhythmogenic substrate.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dogs", "Male", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Myocardial Infarction", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Costet", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lea", "Last Name": "Melki", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Sayseng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nadira", "Last Name": "Hamid", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine-Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Koki", "Last Name": "Nakanishi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine-Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine-Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Hahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine-Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shunichi", "Last Name": "Homma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine-Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Konofagou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2017Nov29"}, {"PMID": "28626939", "Title": "Technical Note: A 3-D rendering algorithm for electromechanical wave imaging of a beating heart.", "Abstract": "Arrhythmias can be treated by ablating the heart tissue in the regions of abnormal contraction.

Electromechanical wave imaging (EWI) is a non-invasive ultrasound-based imaging technique, which tracks the electromechanical activation that immediately follows electrical activation. Electrical and electromechanical activations were previously found to be linearly correlated in the left ventricle, but the relationship has not yet been investigated in the three other chambers of the heart. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between electrical and electromechanical activations and validate EWI in all four chambers of the heart with conventional 3D electroanatomical mapping. Six (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20096) normal adult canines were used in this study. The electrical activation sequence was mapped in all four chambers of the heart, both endocardially and epicardially using the St Jude's EnSite 3D mapping system (St. Jude Medical, Secaucus, NJ). EWI acquisitions were performed in all four chambers during normal sinus rhythm, and during pacing in the left ventricle. Isochrones of the electromechanical activation were generated from standard echocardiographic imaging views. Electrical and electromechanical activation maps were co-registered and compared, and electrical and electromechanical activation times were plotted against each other and linear regression was performed for each pair of activation maps. Electromechanical and electrical activations were found to be directly correlated with slopes of the correlation ranging from 0.77 to 1.83, electromechanical delays between 9 and 58\u2009ms and R 2 values from 0.71 to 0.92. The linear correlation between electrical and electromechanical activations and the agreement between the activation maps indicate that the electromechanical activation follows the pattern of propagation of the electrical activation.

The association of CaV1.2 with a supramolecular complex impacts trafficking, localization, turnover, and, most importantly, multifaceted regulation of its function in the heart. Several studies hint at an important role for the C terminus of the \u03b11C subunit as a hub for multidimensional regulation of CaV1.2 channel trafficking and function. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for the four-residue PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of \u03b11C in interacting with scaffold proteins containing PDZ domains, in the subcellular localization of CaV1.2 in neurons, and in the efficient signaling to cAMP-response element-binding protein in neurons. However, the role of the \u03b11C PDZ ligand domain in the heart is not known. To determine whether the \u03b11C PDZ motif is critical for CaV1.2 trafficking and function in cardiomyocytes, we generated transgenic mice with inducible expression of an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged dihydropyridine-resistant \u03b11C with the PDZ motif deleted (\u0394PDZ). These mice were crossed with \u03b1-myosin heavy chain reverse transcriptional transactivator transgenic mice, and the double-transgenic mice were fed doxycycline. The \u0394PDZ channels expressed, trafficked to the membrane, and supported robust excitation-contraction coupling in the presence of nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine Ca(2+) channel blocker, providing functional evidence that they appropriately target to dyads. The \u0394PDZ Ca(2+) channels were appropriately regulated by isoproterenol and forskolin. These data indicate that the \u03b11C PDZ motif is not required for surface trafficking, localization to the dyad, or adrenergic stimulation of CaV1.2 in adult cardiomyocytes.", "Keywords": ["Adrenergic Stimulation", "Calcium Channel", "Electrophysiology", "Heart", "PDZ Domain", "Transgenic Mice"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Animals", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Colforsin", "Epitopes", "Gene Deletion", "Heart", "Humans", "Ligands", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Neurons", "Nisoldipine", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Rabbits", "Surface Properties"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Weinberg", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Tahmina", "Last Name": "Samad", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 and sm460@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2015Jan23"}, {"PMID": "23517696", "Title": "Diet-induced obesity causes long QT and reduces transcription of voltage-gated potassium channels.", "Abstract": "In humans, obesity is associated with long QT, increased frequency of premature ventricular complexes, and sudden cardiac death.
