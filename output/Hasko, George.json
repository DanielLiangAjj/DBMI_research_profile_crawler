In this context, targeting purinergic P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), which can modulate visceral pain transmission, could represent a promising therapeutic strategy. Herein, we tested the pain-relieving effect of two novel and selective P2X4R antagonists (NC-2600 and NP-1815-PX) in a murine model of DNBS-induced colitis and investigated the mechanisms underlying their effect. Tested drugs and dexamethasone (DEX) were administered orally, two days after colitis induction. Treatment with tested drugs and DEX improved tissue inflammatory parameters (body weight, spleen weight, macroscopic damage, TNF and IL-1\u03b2 levels) in DNBS-rats. In addition, NC-2600 and NP-1815-PX attenuated visceral pain better than DEX and prevented the reduction of occludin expression. In in vitro studies, treatment of CaCo2 cells with supernatant from THP-1 cells, previously treated with LPS plus ATP, reduced the expression of tight junctions protein. By contrast, CaCo2 cells treated with supernatant from THP-1 cells, previously incubated with tested drugs, counteracted the reduction of tight junctions due to the inhibition of P2X4R/NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 axis. In conclusion, these results suggest that the direct and selective inhibition of P2X4R represents a viable approach for the management of visceral pain associated with colitis via NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 axis inhibition.", "Keywords": ["DNBS", "NLRP3 inflammasome", "P2X4 receptor", "abdominal pain", "experimental colitis", "visceral hypersensitivity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Clelia", "Last Name": "DiSalvo", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "D'Antongiovanni", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Benvenuti", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Fornai", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giulia", "Last Name": "Valdiserra", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Gianfranco", "Last Name": "Natale", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Larisa", "Last Name": "Ryskalin", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Lucarini", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, Neurofarba, Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo Di Cesare", "Last Name": "Mannelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, Neurofarba, Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Carla", "Last Name": "Ghelardini", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, Neurofarba, Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Rocchina", "Last Name": "Colucci", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Gy\u00f6rgy", "Last Name": "Hask\u00f3", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carolina", "Last Name": "Pellegrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Antonioli", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "Journal": "Journal of drug targeting", "PubDate": "2024Jun12"}, {"PMID": "38094682", "Title": "PCSK9, A Promising Novel Target for Age-Related Cardiovascular Dysfunction.", "Abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death among elderly people.

They have potent immunomodulatory effects by binding to and activating P1 or adenosine and P2 receptors on the surface of leukocytes. Here we assessed the levels of extracellular purines, their receptors, metabolic enzymes, and cellular transporters in leukocytes of septic patients. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), neutrophils, and plasma were isolated from blood obtained from septic patients and healthy control subjects. Ribonucleic acid was isolated from cells, and mRNA levels for purinergic receptors, enzymes, and transporters were measured. Adenosine triphosphate, UTP, UDP, and adenosine levels were evaluated in plasma. Results: Adenosine triphosphate levels were lower in septic patients than in healthy individuals, and levels of the other purines were comparable between the two groups. Levels of P1 and P2 receptors did not differ between the two patient groups. mRNA levels of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) 1 or CD39 increased, whereas those of NTPDase2, 3, and 8 decreased in PBMCs of septic patients when compared with healthy controls. CD73 mRNA was lower in PBMCs of septic than in healthy individuals. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1 mRNA concentrations were higher and ENT2, 3, and 4 mRNA concentrations were lower in PBMCs of septic subjects when compared with healthy subjects. Concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) 1 mRNA levels were higher in PBMCs of septic versus healthy subjects, whereas the mRNA levels of CNT2, 3, and 4 did not differ. We failed to detect differences in mRNA levels of purinergic receptors, enzymes, and transporters in neutrophils of septic versus healthy subjects. Conclusion: Because CD39 degrades ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), the lower ATP levels in septic individuals may be the result of increased CD39 expression. This increased degradation of ATP did not lead to increased adenosine levels, which may be explained by the decreased expression of CD73, which converts AMP to adenosine.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of these alterations, we employed data-driven approaches, along with biochemical methods, histology, and immunohistochemistry techniques, to systematically investigate the effects of aging on the liver. Our study utilized a well-established rat aging model provided by the National Institute of Aging. Systems biology approaches were used to analyze genome-wide transcriptomics data from liver samples obtained from young (4-5\u00a0months old) and aging (20-21\u00a0months old) Fischer 344 rats. Our findings revealed pathological changes occurring in various essential biological processes in aging livers. These included mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative/nitrative stress, decreased NAD\u2009+\u2009content, impaired amino acid and protein synthesis, heightened inflammation, disrupted lipid metabolism, enhanced apoptosis, senescence, and fibrosis. These results were validated using independent datasets from both human and rat aging studies. Furthermore, by employing co-expression network analysis, we identified novel driver genes responsible for liver aging, confirmed our findings in human aging subjects, and pointed out the cellular localization of the driver genes using single-cell RNA-sequencing human data. Our study led to the discovery and validation of a liver-specific gene, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating the pathological processes associated with aging in the liver.

Restricted oxygen at the cellular level causes inflammation and subsequent cell death. Adenosine triphosphate is the universal intracellular energy currency and an important extracellular inflammatory signaling molecule. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleotide formed as a result of the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate, is also released during T/HS. Adenosine binds to four G protein-coupled receptors (A 1R , A 2a , A 2b , A 3R ) called adenosine receptors or P1 receptors. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of activation, inactivation, and genetic absence of A2aR (A2aR -/- mice) on T/HS-induced multiple organ failure. Wild-type mice were pretreated (30 min before shock induction) with an agonist or antagonist and then subjected to T/HS by withdrawing arterial blood and maintaining the blood pressure between 28 and 32 mm Hg. A2aR -/- mice were subjected to T/HS in the absence of pharmacologic treatment. Neutrophil sequestration was assessed by detecting myeloperoxidase, and Evans blue dye (EBD) method was used to analyze lung permeability. Blood and lung inflammatory cytokine levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were determined spectrophotometrically from plasma.

High glucose-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, activation of various pro-inflammatory, and cell death pathways are critical in the initiation and progression of the changes culminating in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) activation in inflammatory cells and activated endothelium attenuates the pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hepatic cardiomyopathy. In this study, we explored the role of CB2R signaling in myocardial dysfunction, oxidative/nitrative stress, inflammation, cell death, remodeling, and fibrosis associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetic mice. Control human heart left ventricles and atrial appendages, similarly to mouse hearts, had negligible CB2R expression determine by RNA sequencing or real-time RT-PCR. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was characterized by impaired diastolic and systolic cardiac function, enhanced myocardial CB2R expression, oxidative/nitrative stress, and pro-inflammatory response (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, and cell death. Pharmacological activation of CB2R with a selective agonist attenuated diabetes-induced inflammation, oxidative/nitrative stress, fibrosis and cell demise, and consequent cardiac dysfunction without affecting hyperglycemia. In contrast, genetic deletion of CB2R aggravated myocardial pathology. Thus, selective activation of CB2R ameliorates diabetes-induced myocardial tissue injury and preserves the functional contractile capacity of the myocardium in the diabetic milieu. This is particularly encouraging, since unlike CB1R agonists, CB2R agonists do not elicit psychoactive activity and cardiovascular side effects and are potential clinical candidates in the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular and other complications.", "Keywords": ["Accelerated aging", "Cannabinoid 2 receptor", "Cardiomyopathy", "Diabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetic Cardiomyopathies", "Fibrosis", "Inflammation", "Mice", "Oxidative Stress", "Receptors, Cannabinoid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohanraj", "Last Name": "Rajesh", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Partha", "Last Name": "Mukhopadhyay", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "S\u00e1ndor", "Last Name": "B\u00e1tkai", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Arif", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zolt\u00e1n V", "Last Name": "Varga", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Csaba", "Last Name": "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janos", "Last Name": "Paloczi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Lehocki", "Affiliation": "Departments of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South Pest Central Hospital, National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Saint Ladislaus Campus, Budapest, Hungary."}, {"First Name": "Gy\u00f6rgy", "Last Name": "Hask\u00f3", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pal", "Last Name": "Pacher", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology and Tissue Injury, National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. pacher@nih.gov."}], "Journal": "GeroScience", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "35367412", "Title": "Cathepsin D interacts with adenosine A2A receptors in mouse macrophages to modulate cell surface localization and inflammatory signaling.", "Abstract": "Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR)-dependent signaling in macrophages plays a key role in the regulation of inflammation.

Sepsis involves the combination of exaggerated inflammation and immune suppression. During systemic infection and sepsis, the liver works as a lymphoid organ with key functions in regulating the immune response. Extracellular nucleotides are considered damage-associated molecular patterns and are involved in the control of inflammation. Their levels are finely tuned by the membrane-associated ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) enzyme family. Although previous studies have addressed the role of NTPDase1 (CD39), the role of the other extracellular NTPDases, NTPDase2, -3, and -8, in sepsis is unclear. In the present studies we identified NTPDase8 as a top downregulated gene in the liver of mice submitted to cecal ligation-induced sepsis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the decrease of NTPDase8 expression at the protein level. In vitro mechanistic studies using HepG2 hepatoma cells demonstrated that IL-6 but not TNF, IL-1\u03b2, bacteria, or lipopolysaccharide are able to suppress NTPDase8 gene expression. NTPDase8, as well as NTPDase2 and NTPDase3 mRNA was downregulated, whereas NTPDase1 (CD39) mRNA was upregulated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes from both inflamed and septic patients compared to healthy controls. Although the host's inflammatory response of polymicrobial septic NTPDase8 deficient mice was no different from that of wild-type mice, IL-6 levels in NTPDase8 deficient mice were higher than IL-6 levels in wild-type mice with pneumonia.

How IMP regulates inflammation induced by bacterial products or bacteria is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that IMP suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production and augmented IL-10 production in endotoxemic mice. IMP exerted its effects through metabolism to inosine, as IMP only suppressed TNF-\u03b1 following its CD73-mediated degradation to inosine in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Studies with gene targeted mice and pharmacological antagonism indicated that A2A , A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors are not required for the inosine suppression of TNF-\u03b1 production. The inosine suppression of TNF-\u03b1 production did not require its metabolism to hypoxanthine through purine nucleoside phosphorylase or its uptake into cells through concentrative nucleoside transporters indicating a role for alternative metabolic/uptake pathways. Inosine augmented IL-\u03b2 production by macrophages in which inflammasome was activated by lipopolysaccharide and ATP.

Liver diseases can affect cardiovascular function during the early stages of disease progression. The development of cardiovascular diseases in patients with chronic liver failure is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and cardiovascular complications can in turn affect liver function and liver disease progression. Furthermore, numerous infectious, inflammatory, metabolic and genetic diseases, as well as alcohol abuse can also influence both hepatic and cardiovascular outcomes. In this Review, we highlight how chronic liver diseases and associated cardiovascular effects can influence different organ pathologies.

At present, there are no specific therapies for SIC. Previous studies have reported increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction during SIC. However, a unifying mechanism remains to be defined. We hypothesized that PKC\u03b4 is required for abnormal calcium handling and cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction during sepsis and that genetic deletion of PKC\u03b4 would be protective. Polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery decreased the ejection fraction of wild-type (WT) mice but not PKC\u03b4 knockout (KO) mice. Similarly, WT cardiomyocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) demonstrated decreases in contractility and calcium transient amplitude that were not observed in PKC\u03b4 KO cardiomyocytes. LPS treatment decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores in WT cardiomyocytes, which correlated with increased ryanodine receptor-2 oxidation in WT hearts but not PKC\u03b4 KO hearts after sepsis. LPS exposure increased mitochondrial ROS and decreased mitochondrial inner membrane potential in WT cardiomyocytes. This corresponded to morphologic changes consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction such as decreased overall size and cristae disorganization. Increased cellular ROS and changes in mitochondrial morphology were not observed in PKC\u03b4 KO cardiomyocytes. These data show that PKC\u03b4 is required in the pathophysiology of SIC by generating ROS and promoting mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, PKC\u03b4 is a potential target for cardiac protection during sepsis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sepsis is often complicated by cardiac dysfunction, which is associated with a high mortality rate. Our work shows that the protein PKC\u03b4 is required for decreased cardiac contractility during sepsis. Mice with deletion of PKC\u03b4 are protected from cardiac dysfunction after sepsis. PKC\u03b4 causes mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac myocytes, and reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress improves contractility in wild-type cardiomyocytes.

The psychoactive constituent of marijuana, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is an agonist of both CB1R and CB2R, and exerts its psychoactive and adverse cardiovascular effects through the activation of CB1R in the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. The past decade has seen a nearly tenfold increase in the THC content of marijuana as well as the increased availability of highly potent synthetic cannabinoids for recreational use. These changes have been accompanied by the emergence of serious adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

To evaluate the role of A2AARs in regulating glucose and insulin homeostasis in obesity, we fed A2AAR-knockout (KO) and control mice an HFD for 16 wk to initiate HFD-induced metabolic disorder. We found that genetic deletion of A2AARs caused impaired glucose tolerance in mice fed an HFD. This impaired glucose tolerance was caused by a decrease in insulin secretion but not in insulin sensitivity. Islet size and insulin content in pancreata of A2AAR-deficient mice were decreased compared with control mice after consuming an HFD. A2AAR-KO mice had decreased expression of the \u03b2-cell-specific markers pdx1, glut2, mafA, and nkx6.1 and increased expression of the dedifferentiation markers sox2 and hes1. Ex vivo islet experiments confirmed the role of A2AARs in protecting against decreased insulin content and release caused by HFD.

Herein we describe mouse models of alcoholic cardiomyopathies induced by chronic and binge ethanol (EtOH) feeding and characterize detailed hemodynamic alterations, mitochondrial function, and redox signaling in these models. Mice were fed a liquid diet containing 5% EtOH for 10, 20, and 40 days (d) combined with single or multiple EtOH binges (5 g/kg body wt). Isocalorically pair-fed mice served as controls. Left ventricular (LV) function and morphology were assessed by invasive pressure-volume conductance approach and by echocardiography. Mitochondrial complex (I, II, IV) activities, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels, gene expression of markers of oxidative stress (gp91phox, p47phox), mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1\u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1), and fibrosis were examined. Cardiac steatosis and fibrosis were investigated by histological/immunohistochemical methods. Chronic and binge EtOH feeding (already in 10 days EtOH plus single binge group) was characterized by contractile dysfunction (decreased slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and preload recruitable stroke work), impaired relaxation (decreased time constant of LV pressure decay and maximal slope of systolic pressure decrement), and vascular dysfunction (impaired arterial elastance and lower total peripheral resistance). This was accompanied by enhanced myocardial oxidative/nitrative stress (3-NT; gp91phox; p47phox; angiotensin II receptor, type 1a) and deterioration of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV activities and mitochondrial biogenesis, excessive cardiac steatosis, and higher mortality.

DOX's cardiotoxicity involves increased oxidative/nitrative stress, impaired mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes/endothelial cells and cell death. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychotropic constituent of marijuana, which is well tolerated in humans, with antioxidant, antiinflammatory and recently discovered antitumor properties. We aimed to explore the effects of CBD in a well-established mouse model of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. DOX-induced cardiomyopathy was characterized by increased myocardial injury (elevated serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels), myocardial oxidative and nitrative stress (decreased total glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase 1 activity, increased lipid peroxidation, 3-nitrotyrosine formation and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA), myocardial cell death (apoptotic and poly[ADP]-ribose polymerase 1 [PARP]-dependent) and cardiac dysfunction (decline in ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening). DOX also impaired myocardial mitochondrial biogenesis (decreased mitochondrial copy number, mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, estrogen-related receptor alpha), reduced mitochondrial function (attenuated complex I and II activities) and decreased myocardial expression of uncoupling protein 2 and 3 and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA. Treatment with CBD markedly improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, oxidative/nitrative stress and cell death. CBD also enhanced the DOX-induced impaired cardiac mitochondrial function and biogenesis.

Diabetic cardiovascular dysfunction also underscores the development of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Despite the broad availability of antidiabetic therapy, glycemic control still remains a major challenge in the management of diabetic patients. Hyperglycemia triggers formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), activates protein kinase C, enhances polyol pathway, glucose autoxidation, which coupled with elevated levels of free fatty acids, and leptin have been implicated in increased generation of superoxide anion by mitochondria, NADPH oxidases and xanthine oxidoreductase in diabetic vasculature and myocardium. Superoxide anion interacts with nitric oxide forming the potent toxin peroxynitrite via diffusion limited reaction, which in concert with other oxidants triggers activation of stress kinases, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-dependent cell death, dysregulates autophagy/mitophagy, inactivates key proteins involved in myocardial calcium handling/contractility and antioxidant defense, activates matrix metalloproteinases and redox-dependent pro-inflammatory transcription factors (e.g. nuclear factor kappaB) promoting inflammation, AGEs formation, eventually culminating in myocardial dysfunction, remodeling and heart failure.

Pharmacological inhibitors of PARP provide significant therapeutic benefits in various preclinical disease models associated with tissue injury and inflammation. However, our understanding the role of PARP activation in the pathophysiology of liver inflammation and fibrosis is limited. In this study we investigated the role of PARP-1 in liver inflammation and fibrosis using acute and chronic models of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced liver injury and fibrosis, a model of bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced hepatic fibrosis in vivo, and isolated liver-derived cells ex vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP with structurally distinct inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 markedly attenuated CCl4 -induced hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis. Interestingly, the chronic CCl4 -induced liver injury was also characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of numerous genes involved in metabolism. Most of these pathological changes were attenuated by PARP inhibitors.

The role of A2BAR on TIMP-1 production of RAW 264.7 cells was confirmed with specific agonist BAY606583 and antagonist PSB0788. AR stimulation augmented IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages, and pharmacological inhibition or silencing of STAT3 using siRNA reduced the stimulatory effect of AR stimulation on TIMP-1 production.

We used the benchmark PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and a more potent and specific inhibitor PJ34 and found that UVB (0.05-0.2J/cm(2)) induced a dose dependent loss of viability that was prevented by 3AB but not by PJ34. Similarly to PJ34, two other new generation PARP inhibitors also failed to protect keratinocytes from UVB-induced loss of viability. Moreover, silencing PARP-1 in HaCaT human keratinocytes sensitized cells to UVB toxicity but 3AB provided protection to both control HaCaT cells and to PARP-1 silenced cells indicating that the photoprotective effect of 3AB is independent of PARP inhibition. Lower UVB doses (0.0125-0.05J/cm(2)) caused inhibition of proliferation of keratinocytes which was prevented by 3AB but augmented by PJ34. UVB-induced keratinocyte death displayed the characteristics of both apoptosis (morphology, caspase activity, DNA fragmentation) and necrosis (morphology, LDH release) with all of these parameters being inhibited by 3AB and apoptotic parameters slightly enhanced by PJ34. UVA also caused apoptotic and necrotic cell death in keratinocytes with 3AB protecting and PJ34 sensitizing cells to UVA-induced toxicity. 3AB prevented UVB-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and generation of hydrogen peroxide.
