Subsequent investigations in mice demonstrated that ADAMTS7 is proatherogenic, induced in response to vascular injury, and alters smooth muscle cell function. However, the mechanisms governing this function and its relationship to atherosclerosis remain unclear. Here, we report the first conditional Adamts7 transgenic mouse in which the gene can be conditionally overexpressed in smooth muscle cells, mimicking its induction in atherosclerosis. We observed that smooth muscle cell Adamts7 overexpression results in a 3.5-fold increase in peripheral atherosclerosis, coinciding with an expansion of smooth muscle foam cells. RNA sequencing of Adamts7 overexpressed primary smooth muscle cells revealed an upregulation in the expression of lipid uptake genes. Subsequent experiments in primary smooth muscle cells demonstrated that increased Spi1 and Cd36 expression leads to increased smooth muscle cell oxLDL uptake. To uncover ADAMTS7 expression in human disease, we have interrogated the largest scRNA-seq dataset of human carotid atherosclerosis. This analysis discovered that endothelial cells had the highest expression level of ADAMTS7 with lesser expression in smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and mast cells. Subsequent conditional knockout studies in smooth muscle cells surprisingly showed no change in atherosclerosis, suggesting redundant expression of this secreted factor in the vessel wall. Finally, mice overexpressing Adamts7 in endothelial cells also exhibit increased atherosclerosis, suggesting that multiple vascular cell types can contribute to ADAMTS7-mediated foam cell expansion. In summary, Adamts7 is expressed by multiple vascular cell types in atherosclerosis, and ADAMTS7 promotes oxLDL uptake in smooth muscle cells, increasing smooth muscle foam cell formation and peripheral atherosclerosis in mice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Allen", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hyun K", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Huize", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander C", "Last Name": "Bashore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karissa", "Last Name": "Shuck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caio V", "Last Name": "Matias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juliana", "Last Name": "Gomez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hanying", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Feb29"}, {"PMID": "38385291", "Title": "High-Dimensional Single-Cell Multimodal Landscape of Human Carotid Atherosclerosis.", "Abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques are complex tissues composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells.

The differential stress on the artificial fault is increased in stages to bring it towards a critically stressed state.

While TRIB1 is likely causal of these associations, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we sought to investigate how TRIB1 influences low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in mice. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Trib1 (Trib1\u0394hep) in mice increased plasma cholesterol and apoB and slowed the catabolism of LDL-apoB due to decreased levels of LDL receptor (LDLR) mRNA and protein. Simultaneous deletion of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBP\u03b1) with TRIB1 eliminated the effects of TRIB1 on hepatic LDLR regulation and LDL catabolism. Using RNA-seq, we found that activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) was highly upregulated in the livers of Trib1\u0394hep but not Trib1\u0394hep Cebpa\u0394hep mice. ATF3 has been shown to directly bind to the CEBP\u03b1 protein, and to repress the expression of LDLR by binding its promoter. Blunting the increase of ATF3 in Trib1\u0394hep mice reduced the levels of plasma cholesterol and partially attenuated the effects on LDLR.

This tutorial provides simple and complex pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic examples on obtaining optimal sample times, doses, or best division of subjects among design groups. Robust design techniques accounting for likely variability among subjects are also shown. A design evaluator and optimizer within NONMEM allows any control stream first developed for trial design exploration to be subsequently used for estimation of parameters of simulated or clinical data, without transferring the model to another software. Conversely, a model developed in NONMEM could be used for design optimization. In addition, the $DESIGN feature can be used on any model file and dataset combination to retrospectively evaluate the model parameter uncertainty one would expect given that the model generated the data, particularly if outliers of the actual data prevent a reasonable assessment of the variance-covariance.

One critical mediator of these responses is the IL-1 family cytokine IL-33, which is rapidly secreted upon acute epithelial injury as an alarmin and induces type 2 immune responses. Our recent work highlighted the importance of the NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) in acute airway epithelial IL-33 secretion by various airborne allergens associated with H2O2 production and reduction-oxidation-dependent activation of Src kinases and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. In this study, we show that IL-33 secretion in response to acute airway challenge with house dust mite (HDM) allergen critically depends on the activation of Src by a DUOX1-dependent oxidative mechanism. Intriguingly, HDM-induced epithelial IL-33 secretion was dramatically attenuated by small interfering RNA- or Ab-based approaches to block IL-33 signaling through its receptor IL1RL1 (ST2), indicating that HDM-induced IL-33 secretion includes a positive feed-forward mechanism involving ST2-dependent IL-33 signaling. Moreover, activation of type 2 cytokine responses by direct airway IL-33 administration was associated with ST2-dependent activation of DUOX1-mediated H2O2 production and reduction-oxidation-based activation of Src and EGFR and was attenuated in Duox1 -/- and Src +/- mice, indicating that IL-33-induced epithelial signaling and subsequent airway responses involve DUOX1/Src-dependent pathways. Collectively, our findings suggest an intricate relationship between DUOX1, Src, and IL-33 signaling in the activation of innate type 2 immune responses to allergens, involving DUOX1-dependent epithelial Src/EGFR activation in initial IL-33 secretion and in subsequent IL-33 signaling through ST2 activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Allergens", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Dual Oxidases", "Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein", "Interleukin-33", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Signal Transduction", "src-Family Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Dustin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Aida", "Last Name": "Habibovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Milena", "Last Name": "Hristova", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Caspar", "Last Name": "Schiffers", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn R", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Miao-Chong Joy", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Heppner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Nirav", "Last Name": "Daphtary", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Minara", "Last Name": "Aliyeva", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "van der Vliet", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT; albert.van-der-vliet@uvm.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2021Jun15"}, {"PMID": "34016120", "Title": "Surrogate endpoint evaluation using data from one large global randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Robust identification of surrogate endpoints can help accelerate the development of pharmacotherapies for diseases traditionally evaluated using true endpoints associated with prolonged follow-up.

We evaluated lung tissue sections from patients with COPD for small airway epithelial DUOX1 protein expression, in association with measures of lung function and small airway and alveolar remodeling. We also addressed the impact of DUOX1 for lung tissue remodeling in mouse models of COPD. Small airway DUOX1 levels were decreased in advanced COPD and correlated with loss of lung function and markers of emphysema and remodeling. Similarly, DUOX1 downregulation in correlation with extracellular matrix remodeling was observed in a genetic model of COPD, transgenic SPC-TNF-\u03b1 mice. Finally, development of subepithelial airway fibrosis in mice due to exposure to the CS-component acrolein, or alveolar emphysema induced by administration of elastase, were in both cases exacerbated in Duox1-deficient mice.

One reason for such failure is that these numerical optimization methods cannot distinguish between the minimum, maximum, and a saddle point; hence, the parameters found by these optimization algorithms can possibly be in any of these three stationary points on the likelihood surface. We have found that for maximization of the likelihood for nonlinear mixed effects models used in pharmaceutical development, the optimization algorithm Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) often terminates in saddle points, and we propose an algorithm, saddle-reset, to avoid the termination at saddle points, based on the second partial derivative test. In this algorithm, we use the approximated Hessian matrix at the point where BFGS terminates, perturb the point in the direction of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue, and restart the BFGS algorithm. We have implemented this algorithm in industry standard software for nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM, version 7.4 and up) and showed that it can be used to avoid termination of parameter estimation at saddle points, as well as unveil practical parameter non-identifiability.

Use of mob stocking has generated considerable interest among forage-livestock professionals in recent years, but questions remain about its purported benefits to cattle and forage plants. To address questions about the possible benefits of mob stocking, a 3-yr study (2014-2016) was conducted in Virginia, USA comparing mob, rotational, and continuous stocking methods in a temperate grassland common to that region. The main objective of this study was to evaluate how mob-stocking management affected selected forage variables, cattle performance, and legume/weed abundance. Herbage mass and nutritive value were measured monthly. Cow and calf weights and body condition score (BCS) were used as indicators of animal performance. Legumes (red and white clover) were over-seeded prior to the study, and their abundance along with weeds were evaluated annually thereafter. Mean herbage mass and forage nutritive values were similar across mob, rotational and continuously stocked systems despite extra-long rest periods that allowed grasses to grow tall and over-mature under mob stocking. Cow weights going into winter were lower (P < 0.05) under mob stocking (619 kg) compared with continuous stocking (688 kg) possibly because many tall grasses were trampled and not grazed. Lastly, we found mob stocking can favor establishment of erect-growing red clover (Trifolium pretense L.), but it had no effect on weed abundance.

Although histone modifications are important markers of gene regulatory elements of the genome, any specific histone modification has not been assayed in more than a few individuals in the human liver. As a result, the effects of genetic variation on histone modification states in the liver are poorly understood. Here, we generate the most comprehensive genome-wide dataset of two epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and annotate thousands of putative regulatory elements in the human liver. We integrate these findings with genome-wide gene expression data collected from the same human liver tissues and high-resolution promoter-focused chromatin interaction maps collected from human liver-derived HepG2 cells. We demonstrate widespread functional consequences of natural genetic variation on putative regulatory element activity and gene expression levels. Leveraging these extensive datasets, we fine-map a total of 74 GWAS loci that have been associated with at least one complex phenotype. Our results reveal a repertoire of genes and regulatory mechanisms governing complex disease development and further the basic understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the human liver tissue.", "Keywords": ["CAPTURE-C", "ChIP-seq", "DNA-looping", "GWAS", "RNA-seq", "eQTL", "fine mapping", "gene regulation", "hQTL", "liver"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Chromatin", "Chromosome Mapping", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Hep G2 Cells", "Histones", "Humans", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Prospective Studies", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minal", "Last Name": "\u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

This creates a dilemma for the forensic psychiatrist because the definition of delusion may not be adequate. We discuss the evolution of the term \"overvalued idea\" first described in a forensic context by neuropsychiatrist Carl Wernicke in 1892. The overvalued idea is invoked in British scholarship as a definition for beliefs seen in anorexia nervosa, morbid jealousy, paranoid litigious states, and other disorders. This is sometimes referred to as delusional disorder by psychiatrists in the United States. The concept of an extreme overvalued belief has recently been validated and is separate from an obsession or delusion. It plays an important role in identifying fixation as a warning sign in threat assessment. We use this definition in three well-known cases (i.e., Anders Breivik, John Hinckley, Jr., and Ted Kaczynski) to emphasize how form and content of beliefs are critical to understanding the mens rea in violent criminal acts. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, would be enhanced by the addition of extreme overvalued belief as a definition to differentiate it from idiosyncratic, fixed, false beliefs seen in delusion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Criminals", "Forensic Psychiatry", "Humans", "Prohibitins", "Schizophrenia, Paranoid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tahir", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Dr. Rahman is Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine.

The 8q24 locus, containing the gene TRIB1 ( Tribbles-1), is the only novel GWAS locus that associates with all 4 plasma lipid traits and coronary artery disease, an observation that has spurred immense interest in this locus. Subsequent in vivo loss and gain of function studies confirmed that Trib1 plays a role in hepatic lipid metabolism, validating the initial genetic observation. Yet, many challenges remain in discerning the nature of the association between the TRIB1 locus and cardiometabolic phenotypes. Is TRIB1 the causal gene at the 8q24 locus and what is the functional consequence of the associated noncoding variation? Is the relationship between TRIB1 and the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) the primary molecular mechanism governing the genetic association or could it be an as yet unknown function for this interesting pseudokinase? Is hepatic TRIB1 the sole regulator of lipid metabolism or could extrahepatic TRIB1 play a role as well?

The response of their molecular and solid state electronic structures to pressure has been explored over the range 0-10 GPa. The crystal structures, which consist of cofacially aligned (pancake) \u03c0-dimers packed into herringbone arrays, experience a continuous, near-isotropic compression. While the intramolecular covalent E-E (E = S/Se) bonds remain relatively unchanged with pressurization, the intradimer E\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7E separations are significantly shortened. Molecular and band electronic structure calculations using density functional theory methods indicate that compression of the \u03c0-dimers leads to a widening of the gap \u0394 E between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the dimer, an effect that offsets the expected decrease in the valence-to-conduction band gap Eg occasioned by pressure-induced spreading of the valence and conduction bands. Consistent with the predicted consequences of this competition between intra- and interdimer interactions, variable temperature high pressure conductivity measurements reveal at best an order-of-magnitude increase in conductivity with pressure for the two compounds over the pressure range 0-10 GPa. While a small reduction in the thermal activation energy Eact with increasing pressure is observed, extrapolation of the rate of decrease suggests a projected onset of metallization ( Eact \u2248 0) in excess of 20 GPa.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenjun", "Last Name": "Yong", "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences , University of Western Ontario , London , Ontario N6A 5B7 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Lekin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario N2L 3G1 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Robert P C", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , University of Saskatchewan , Saskatoon , Saskatchewan S7N 5E2 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Tse", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , University of Saskatchewan , Saskatoon , Saskatchewan S7N 5E2 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Desgreniers", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , University of Ottawa , Ottawa , Ontario K1N 6N5 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Secco", "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences , University of Western Ontario , London , Ontario N6A 5B7 , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Naohisa", "Last Name": "Hirao", "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division , Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute , SPring-8, Sayo , Hyogo 679-5198 , Japan."}, {"First Name": "Richard T", "Last Name": "Oakley", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario N2L 3G1 , Canada."}], "Journal": "Inorganic chemistry", "PubDate": "2019Mar04"}, {"PMID": "30564315", "Title": "\"To survey or to register\" is that the question for estimating population incidence of injuries?", "Abstract": "Measuring the true incidence of injury or medically attended injury is challenging.

As expected, wild-type (Control) mice became obese and diabetic on a high-fat diet, and obese mice with myeloid-specific loss of Zfp36 [knockout (KO)] demonstrated increased adipose tissue and liver cytokine mRNA expression compared with Control mice. Unexpectedly, in glucose tolerance testing and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, myeloid Zfp36 KO mice demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity compared with Control mice. Obese KO and Control mice had similar macrophage infiltration of the adipose depots and similar peripheral cytokine levels, but lean and obese KO mice demonstrated increased Kupffer cell (KC; the hepatic macrophage)-expressed Mac2 compared with lean Control mice. Insulin resistance in obese Control mice was associated with enhanced Zfp36 expression in KCs. Compared with Control mice, KO mice demonstrated increased hepatic mRNA expression of a multitude of classical (M1) inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and this M1-inflammatory hepatic milieu was associated with enhanced nuclear localization of IKK\u03b2 and the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. Our data confirm the important role of innate immune cells in regulating hepatic insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, challenge-prevailing models in which M1 inflammatory responses predict insulin resistance, and indicate that myeloid-expressed Zfp36 modulates the response to insulin in mice.", "Keywords": ["Zfp36", "diabetes", "inflammation", "insulin", "liver", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Cytokines", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Liver", "I-kappa B Kinase", "Inflammation", "Insulin Resistance", "Kupffer Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myeloid Cells", "Obesity", "Organ Size", "RNA, Messenger", "Transcription Factor RelA", "Tristetraprolin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Caracciolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jeanette", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Gonzales", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Yingchun", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ross", "Last Name": "Summer", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Waldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jason K", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Dae Young", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Hye Lim", "Last Name": "Noh", "Affiliation": "Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Taekyoon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Perry J", "Last Name": "Blackshear", "Affiliation": "Signal Transduction Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "O'Connell", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Caleb B", "Last Name": "Kallen", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Some DNA ligases have also been observed to ligate two DNA fragments with short complementary overhangs or blunt-ended termini. In this study, several wild-type DNA ligases (phage T3, T4, and T7 DNA ligases, Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV1) DNA ligase, human DNA ligase 3, and Escherichia coli DNA ligase) were tested for their ability to ligate DNA fragments with several difficult to ligate end structures (blunt-ended termini, 3'- and 5'- single base overhangs, and 5'-two base overhangs). This analysis revealed that T4 DNA ligase, the most common enzyme utilized for in vitro ligation, had its greatest activity on blunt- and 2-base overhangs, and poorest on 5'-single base overhangs. Other ligases had different substrate specificity: T3 DNA ligase ligated only blunt ends well; PBCV1 DNA ligase joined 3'-single base overhangs and 2-base overhangs effectively with little blunt or 5'- single base overhang activity; and human ligase 3 had highest activity on blunt ends and 5'-single base overhangs. There is no correlation of activity among ligases on blunt DNA ends with their activity on single base overhangs. In addition, DNA binding domains (Sso7d, hLig3 zinc finger, and T4 DNA ligase N-terminal domain) were fused to PBCV1 DNA ligase to explore whether modified binding to DNA would lead to greater activity on these difficult to ligate substrates. These engineered ligases showed both an increased binding affinity for DNA and increased activity, but did not alter the relative substrate preferences of PBCV1 DNA ligase, indicating active site structure plays a role in determining substrate preference.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Ligases", "Electrophoresis, Capillary", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Zhelkovsky", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Bilotti", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Laura E", "Last Name": "Crowell", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Thomas C", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Larry A", "Last Name": "McReynolds", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gregory J S", "Last Name": "Lohman", "Affiliation": "Research Division, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "29223027", "Title": "Burden of injury of serious road injuries in six EU countries.", "Abstract": "Information about the burden of (non-fatal) road traffic injury is very useful to further improve road safety policy.

Because of the heterotrimeric nature of the PCNA clamp in some archaea, there is potential to occupy and regulate specific polymerases at defined subunits.

The SHE complex can not only coordinate polymerase exchange within the complex but also provides a mechanism for recruitment of polymerases from solution based on multiequilibrium processes.

Such assistive approaches seek to maximize speed and classification accuracy for high-dimensional control. More recent approaches use similar technology, but aim to restore lost motor function in the long term. To achieve this goal, restorative neuroprosthetics attempt to facilitate motor re-learning and to strengthen damaged and/or alternative neural connections on the basis of neurofeedback training within rehabilitative environments. Such a restorative approach requires reinforcement learning of self-modulated brain activity which is considered to be beneficial for functional rehabilitation, e.g., improvement of \u03b2-power modulation over sensorimotor areas for post-stroke movement restoration. Patients with motor impairments, however, may also have a compromised ability for motor task-related regulation of the targeted brain activity. This would affect the estimation of feature weights and hence the classification accuracy of the feedback device. This, in turn, can frustrate the patients and compromise their motor learning. Furthermore, the feedback training may even become erroneous when unconstrained classifier adaptation-which is often used in assistive approaches-is also applied in this rehabilitation context. In conclusion, the conceptual switch from assistance toward restoration necessitates a methodological paradigm shift from classification accuracy toward instructional efficiency. Furthermore, a constrained feature space, a priori regularized feature weights, and difficulty adaptation present key elements of restorative brain interfaces. These factors need, therefore, to be addressed within a therapeutic framework to facilitate reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation for restorative purposes.", "Keywords": ["assistive technology", "brain-computer interface", "brain-machine interface", "brain-robot interface", "neurorehabilitation", "rehabilitation robotics", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Division of Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen Tuebingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alireza", "Last Name": "Gharabaghi", "Affiliation": "Division of Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen Tuebingen, Germany."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28165732", "Title": "Rapid Time Scale Analysis of T4 DNA Ligase-DNA Binding.", "Abstract": "DNA ligases, essential to both in vivo genome integrity and in vitro molecular biology, catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between adjacent 3'-OH and 5'-phosphorylated termini in dsDNA. This reaction requires enzyme self-adenylylation, using ATP or NAD+ as a cofactor, and AMP release concomitant with phosphodiester bond formation. In this study, we present the first fast time scale binding kinetics of T4 DNA ligase to both nicked substrate DNA (nDNA) and product-equivalent non-nicked dsDNA, as well as binding and release kinetics of AMP. The described assays utilized a fluorescein-dT labeled DNA substrate as a reporter for ligase\u00b7DNA interactions via stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that binding to nDNA by the active adenylylated ligase occurs in two steps, an initial rapid association equilibrium followed by a transition to a second bound state prior to catalysis. Furthermore, the ligase binds and dissociates from nicked and nonsubstrate dsDNA rapidly with initial association affinities on the order of 100 nM regardless of enzyme adenylylation state. DNA binding occurs through a two-step mechanism in all cases, confirming prior proposals of transient binding followed by a transition to a productive ligase\u00b7nDNA (Lig\u00b7nDNA) conformation but suggesting that weaker nonproductive \"closed\" complexes are formed as well. These observations demonstrate the mechanistic underpinnings of competitive inhibition by rapid binding of nonsubstrate DNA, and of substrate inhibition by blocking of the self-adenylylation reaction through nick binding by deadenylylated ligase.

Here, we explored the effects of acute acrolein exposure on innate airway responses to two common airborne allergens, house dust mite and Alternaria alternata, and observed that acrolein exposure of C57BL/6 mice (5 ppm, 4 h) dramatically inhibited innate airway responses to subsequent allergen challenge, demonstrated by attenuated release of the epithelial-derived cytokines IL-33, IL-25, and IL-1\u03b1. Acrolein and other anti-inflammatory thiol-reactive electrophiles, cinnamaldehyde, curcumin, and sulforaphane, similarly inhibited allergen-induced production of these cytokines from human or murine airway epithelial cells in vitro. Based on our previous observations indicating the importance of Ca2+-dependent signaling, activation of the NADPH oxidase DUOX1, and Src/EGFR-dependent signaling in allergen-induced epithelial secretion of these cytokines, we explored the impact of acrolein on these pathways. Acrolein and other thiol-reactive electrophiles were found to dramatically prevent allergen-induced activation of DUOX1 as well as EGFR, and acrolein was capable of inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity via modification of C797. Biotin-labeling strategies indicated increased cysteine modification and carbonylation of Src, EGFR, as well as DUOX1, in response to acrolein exposure in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that direct alkylation of these proteins on accessible cysteine residues may be responsible for their inhibition.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly identified variants at the genomic TRIB1 locus as being significantly associated with multiple plasma lipid traits and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. The involvement of TRIB1 in hepatic lipid metabolism has been validated through viral-mediated hepatic overexpression of the gene in mice; increasing levels of TRIB1 decreased plasma lipids in a dose-dependent manner. Additional studies have implicated TRIB1 in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and NAFLD. The exact mechanisms of TRIB1 regulation of both plasma lipids and hepatic lipogenesis remain undetermined, although multiple signalling pathways and transcription factors have been implicated in tribbles-1 function.

The underlying neurophysiology of this BRI neuromodulation is still largely unknown. We investigated changes of corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation in thirteen right-handed healthy subjects who performed 40min of kinesthetic motor imagery receiving proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis attached to the left hand contingent to event-related desynchronization of the right sensorimotor cortex in the \u03b2-band (16-22Hz). Neural correlates of this BRI intervention were probed by acquiring the stimulus-response curve (SRC) of both motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitudes and areas under the curve. In addition, a motor mapping was obtained. The specificity of the effects was studied by comparing two neighboring hand muscles, one BRI-trained and one control muscle. Robust changes of MEP amplitude but not MEP area occurred following the BRI intervention, but only in the BRI-trained muscle. The steep part of the SRC showed an MEP increase, while the plateau of the SRC showed an MEP decrease. MEP mapping revealed a distributed pattern with a decrease of excitability in the hand area of the primary motor cortex, which controlled the BRI, but an increase of excitability in the surrounding somatosensory and premotor cortex.

Cobalt/Graphene resulting from this treatment can support a band gap of 0.30\u2009eV, while remaining largely undamaged to preserve its structural and electrical properties. A mechanism of cobalt-mediated band opening is proposed as a two-step process starting with charge transfer from metal to graphene, followed by formation of oxides where cobalt has been deposited.

Aerial surveys are a common tool to monitor the density and abundance of marine mammals, and have recently become a focus in the search for methods to provide fisheries-independent abundance indicators for tuna stock assessment. In this study, we present first density estimates corrected for availability bias of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from the Golf of Lions (GoL), compared with uncorrected estimates of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT; Thunnus thynnus) densities from 8 years of line transect aerial surveys. The raw sighting data were further used to analyze patterns of spatial co-occurrence and density of these three top marine predators in this important feeding ground in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. These patterns were investigated regarding known species-specific feeding preferences and environmental characteristics (i. e. mesoscale activity) of the survey zone. ABFT was by far the most abundant species during the surveys in terms of schools and individuals, followed by striped dolphins and fin whales. However, when accounted for availability bias, schools of dolphins and fin whales were of equal density. Direct interactions of the species appeared to be the exception, but results indicate that densities, presence and core sighting locations of striped dolphins and ABFT were correlated. Core sighting areas of these species were located close to an area of high mesoscale activity (oceanic fronts and eddies). Fin whales did not show such a correlation.

Hepatic overexpression of C/EBP\u03b1 in WT mice phenocopied Trib1_LSKO livers, and hepatic knockout of Cebpa in Trib1_LSKO mice revealed that C/EBP\u03b1 is required for the increased lipogenesis.

Positive selection analyses revealed the highest percentage of positively selected PSEPs in C. bombacis compared with other Ustilaginomycotina genomes.

Interestingly, these genes are also absent in cultivable oomycete animal pathogens, while nitrate reductase has been lost in cultivable oomycete plant pathogens. Similar patterns were also observed for obligate biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic fungal and oomycete pathogens.

Measures such as the maximum classification accuracy (CA) have been introduced to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. Interestingly enough, precisely these measures are often used to estimate the subject's ability to perform brain self-regulation. This is surprising, given that the goal of improving the tool that differentiates between brain states is different from the aim of optimizing NFB for the subject performing brain self-regulation. For the latter, knowledge about mental resources and work load is essential in order to adapt the difficulty of the intervention accordingly.

Although current co-adaptive algorithms are powerful for assistive BCIs, their inherent class switching clashes with the operant conditioning goal of restorative BCIs. Moreover, due to the treatment rationale, the classifier of restorative BCIs usually has a constrained feature space, thus limiting the possibility of classifier adaptation. In this context, we applied a Bayesian model of neurofeedback and reinforcement learning for different threshold selection strategies to study the impact of threshold adaptation of a linear classifier on optimizing restorative BCIs. For each feedback iteration, we first determined the thresholds that result in minimal action entropy and maximal instructional efficiency. We then used the resulting vector for the simulation of continuous threshold adaptation. We could thus show that threshold adaptation can improve reinforcement learning, particularly in cases of BCI illiteracy.

Twenty right-handed subjects performed several behavioral tasks as indicators for imagery and execution of movements of the left hand, i.e. kinesthetic imagery, visual imagery, visuomotor integration and tonic contraction. In addition, subjects performed motor imagery supported by haptic/proprioceptive feedback from a brain-robot-interface.

Ultrastructurally, the presence of S. herbamans was detected in the cortical cells of Plantago media, Potentilla anserina and Triticum aestivum. In addition, 13 few frequent molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) or species were found across agricultural and grassland habitats, which did not exhibit a distinctive phylogenetic structure. Laboratory-based assays indicate that S. herbamans has the ability to colonize fine roots and stimulate plant growth. Although endophytic Sebacinales are widely distributed across agricultural and grassland habitats, TEM and nested PCR analyses reinforce the observation that these microorganisms are present in low quantity in plant roots, with no evidence of host specificity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Agriculture", "Arabidopsis", "Basidiomycota", "Endophytes", "Genetic Variation", "Grassland", "Phylogeny", "Plant Roots", "Poa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Riess", "Affiliation": "Plant Evolutionary Ecology, Institute of Evolution and Ecology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Franz", "Last Name": "Oberwinkler", "Affiliation": "Plant Evolutionary Ecology, Institute of Evolution and Ecology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Plant Evolutionary Ecology, Institute of Evolution and Ecology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sigisfredo", "Last Name": "Garnica", "Affiliation": "Plant Evolutionary Ecology, Institute of Evolution and Ecology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24529150", "Title": "Genetic manipulation of the ApoF/Stat2 locus supports an important role for type I interferon signaling in atherosclerosis.", "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein F (ApoF) is a sialoglycoprotein that is a component of the HDL and LDL fractions of human serum.

One of the primary effectors of Rock is non-muscle myosin II. Activation of Rock results in increased contractility of myosin II and subsequent changes in actin architecture and cell morphology. The regulation of Rock is thought to occur via autoinhibition of the kinase domain via intramolecular interactions between the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the kinase. This autoinhibited state can be relieved via proteolytic cleavage, binding of lipids to a Pleckstrin Homology domain near the C-terminus, or binding of GTP-bound RhoA to the central coiled-coil region of Rock. Recent work has identified the Shroom family of proteins as an additional regulator of Rock either at the level of cellular distribution or catalytic activity or both. The Shroom-Rock complex is conserved in most animals and is essential for the formation of the neural tube, eye, and gut in vertebrates. To address the mechanism by which Shroom and Rock interact, we have solved the structure of the coiled-coil region of Rock that binds to Shroom proteins. Consistent with other observations, the Shroom binding domain is a parallel coiled-coil dimer. Using biochemical approaches, we have identified a large patch of residues that contribute to Shrm binding. Their orientation suggests that there may be two independent Shrm binding sites on opposing faces of the coiled-coil region of Rock. Finally, we show that the binding surface is essential for Rock colocalization with Shroom and for Shroom-mediated changes in cell morphology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fluorescence Polarization", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Humans", "Microfilament Proteins", "Myosin Type II", "Protein Binding", "rho-Associated Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Swarna", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Debamitra", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Heroux", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jenna K", "Last Name": "Zalewski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Heber", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Atinuke M", "Last Name": "Dosunmu-Ogunbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Trakselis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey D", "Last Name": "Hildebrand", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrew P", "Last Name": "Vandemark", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "24252435", "Title": "Clinical and multimodal biomarker correlates of ADNI neuropathological findings.", "Abstract": "Autopsy series commonly report a high percentage of coincident pathologies in demented patients, including patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT).

This study aimed to investigate the interaction between these two frequency bands, under the premise that the regional modulation of \u03b2-band power is linked to a cortical network in the \u03b1-band. We therefore designed a procedure to maximize the modulation of \u03b2-band activity over the sensorimotor cortex by combining kinesthetic motor-imagery with closed-loop haptic feedback. The cortical network activity during this procedure was estimated via the phase slope index in electroencephalographic recordings. Analysis of effective connectivity within the \u03b1-band network revealed an information flow between the precentral (premotor and primary motor), postcentral (primary somatosensory) and parietal cortical areas. The range of \u03b2-modulation was connected to a reduction of an ipsilateral sensorimotor and parietal \u03b1-network and, consequently, to a lateralization of this network to the contralateral side.

Kinetic experiments reveal that ATP binding to replication factor C (RFC) is sufficient for loading the heterotrimeric PCNA123 [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] clamp onto DNA that includes a rate-limiting conformational rearrangement of the complex. ATP hydrolysis is required for favorable recruitment and interactions with the replication polymerase (PolB1) that most likely include clamp closing and RFC dissociation. Surprisingly, the assembled holoenzyme complex synthesizes DNA distributively and with low processivity, unlike most other well-characterized DNA polymerase holoenzyme complexes. We show that PolB1 repeatedly disengages from the DNA template, leaving PCNA123 behind. Interactions with a newly identified C-terminal PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif on PolB1 specifically with PCNA2 are required for holoenzyme formation and continuous re-recruitment during synthesis. The extended tail-like structure of the C-terminal PIP motif in PolB1 is revealed alone and when bound to DNA using small-angle X-ray scattering allowing us to develop a model for the holoenzyme complex.

Archaeal organisms contain conserved primase genes homologous to both the bacterial DnaG and archaeo-eukaryotic primase families. The inclusion of multiple DNA primases within a whole domain of organisms complicates the assignment of the metabolic roles of each. In support of a functional bacterial-like DnaG primase participating in archaeal DNA replication, we have detected an interaction of Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG (SsoDnaG) with the replicative S. solfataricus minichromosome maintenance (SsoMCM) helicase on DNA. The interaction site has been mapped to the N-terminal tier of SsoMCM analogous to bacterial primosome complexes. Mutagenesis within the metal binding site of SsoDnaG verifies a functional homology with bacterial DnaG that perturbs priming activity and DNA binding. The complex of SsoDnaG with SsoMCM stimulates the ATPase activity of SsoMCM but leaves the priming activity of SsoDnaG unchanged. Competition for binding DNA between SsoDnaG and SsoMCM can reduce the unwinding ability. Fluorescent gel shift experiments were used to quantify the binding of the ternary SsoMCM-DNA-SsoDnaG complex. This direct interaction of a bacterial-like primase with a eukaryotic-like helicase suggests that formation of a unique but homologous archaeal primosome complex is possible but may require other components to stimulate activities. Identification of this archaeal primosome complex broadly impacts evolutionary relationships of DNA replication.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Helicases", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "DNA Primase", "DNA, Archaeal", "Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay", "Models, Biological", "Models, Chemical", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Sulfolobus solfataricus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, 219 Parkman Avenue, 801 Chevron, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian W", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Trakselis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of molecular biology", "PubDate": "2013Apr26"}, {"PMID": "23263773", "Title": "Assessment of glycemic response to an oral glucokinase activator in a proof of concept study: application of a semi-mechanistic, integrated glucose-insulin-glucagon model.", "Abstract": "A proof of concept study was conducted to investigate the safety and tolerability of a novel oral glucokinase activator, LY2599506, during multiple dose administration to healthy volunteers and subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To analyze the study data, a previously established semi-mechanistic integrated glucose-insulin model was extended to include characterization of glucagon dynamics. The model captured endogenous glucose and insulin dynamics, including the amplifying effects of glucose on insulin production and of insulin on glucose elimination, as well as the inhibitory influence of glucose and insulin on hepatic glucose production. The hepatic glucose production in the model was increased by glucagon and glucagon production was inhibited by elevated glucose concentrations. The contribution of exogenous factors to glycemic response, such as ingestion of carbohydrates in meals, was also included in the model. The effect of LY2599506 on glucose homeostasis in subjects with T2DM was investigated by linking a one-compartment, pharmacokinetic model to the semi-mechanistic, integrated glucose-insulin-glucagon system. Drug effects were included on pancreatic insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production. The relationships between LY2599506, glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations were described quantitatively and consequently, the improved understanding of the drug-response system could be used to support further clinical study planning during drug development, such as dose selection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Enzyme Activators", "Female", "Glucagon", "Glucokinase", "Glucose", "Humans", "Insulin", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karen B", "Last Name": "Schneck", "Affiliation": "Global PK/PD/Pharmacometrics, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA. kschneck@lilly.com"}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mats O", "Last Name": "Karlsson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vikram P", "Last Name": "Sinha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "22891937", "Title": "Phylogenetic diversity and structure of sebacinoid fungi associated with plant communities along an altitudinal gradient.", "Abstract": "To study the diversity and phylogenetic structure of Sebacinales communities from eight vegetation communities along an altitudinal gradient in the Bavarian Alps (Germany), we analysed 456 thalli or roots of plants. We detected 264 sebacinoid sequences, spanning the intergenic transcribed spacer region, 5.8S and D1/D2 regions of the nuclear rRNA gene, mostly using a nested PCR approach. Based on 97% sequence similarity, 73 Sebacinales molecular taxonomic units were found from 70 host species belonging to 44 plant families. Twenty-six molecular taxonomic units represented singletons, the most frequent of these being restricted exclusively to either wooded or grassland habitats. Although Sebacinales appear to occur in low abundance in plant roots, these microorganisms are phylogenetically diverse and widely spread in the ecosystems studied. Ordination analyses showed that land use, pH and humus content strongly influence the diversity and assembly of Sebacinales. In most cases, Sebacinales communities in ecosystems with extreme soil conditions or intensive land use exhibited significant phylogenetic clustering, whereas in undisturbed plant communities no trend was observed. These results suggest that ecosystem disturbance and environmental forces have an influence on the diversity and structure of Sebacinales community assembly over local and spatial scales.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Altitude", "Basidiomycota", "Ecosystem", "Germany", "Host Specificity", "Mycorrhizae", "Phylogeny", "Plant Roots", "Plants", "Soil"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sigisfredo", "Last Name": "Garnica", "Affiliation": "Chair of Plant Evolutionary Ecology, Institute of Evolution and Ecology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany. sigisfredo.garnica@uni-tuebingen.de"}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Riess", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Franz", "Last Name": "Oberwinkler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Wei\u00df", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "FEMS microbiology ecology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
