[{"PMID": "28654681", "Title": "Abnormal neurofilament inclusions and segregations in dorsal root ganglia of a Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E mouse model.", "Abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy is the most prevalent inherited peripheral neuropathy and is associated with over 90 causative genes. Mutations in neurofilament light polypeptide gene, NEFL cause CMT2E, an axonal form of CMT that results in abnormal structures and/or functions of peripheral axons in spinal cord motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons. We have previously generated and characterized a knock-in mouse model of CMT2E with the N98S mutation in Nefl that presented with multiple inclusions in spinal cord neurons. In this report, we conduct immunofluorescence studies of cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from NeflN98S/+ mice, and show that inclusions found in DRG neurites can occur in embryonic stages. Ultrastructural analyses reveal that the inclusions are disordered neurofilaments packed in high density, segregated from other organelles. Immunochemical studies show decreased NFL protein levels in DRG, cerebellum and spinal cord in NeflN98S/+ mice, and total NFL protein pool is shifted toward the triton-insoluble fraction. Our findings reveal the nature of the inclusions in NeflN98S/+ mice, provide useful information to understand mechanisms of CMT2E disease, and identify DRG from NeflN98S/+ mice as a useful cell line model for therapeutic discoveries.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Cerebellum", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Inclusion Bodies", "Intermediate Filaments", "Mice", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Spinal Cord"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kristy", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ronald K H", "Last Name": "Liem", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27698030", "Title": "Cytoskeletal Integrators: The Spectrin Superfamily.", "Abstract": "This review discusses the spectrin superfamily of proteins that function to connect cytoskeletal elements to each other, the cell membrane, and the nucleus. The signature domain is the spectrin repeat, a 106-122-amino-acid segment comprising three \u03b1-helices. \u03b1-actinin is considered to be the ancestral protein and functions to cross-link actin filaments. It then evolved to generate spectrin and dystrophin that function to link the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane, as well as the spectraplakins and plakins that link cytoskeletal elements to each other and to junctional complexes. A final class comprises the nesprins, which are able to bind to the nuclear membrane.

However, \u03b1-internexin is often expressed together with the NFTPs and has been proposed as the fourth subunit of the neurofilaments in the central nervous system. \u03b1-Internexin is also expressed earlier in the development than the NFTPs and is a maker for neuronal IF inclusion disease. \u03b1-Internexin can self-polymerize in vitro and in transfected cells and it is present in the absence of the NFTP in development and in granule cells in the cerebellum. In contrast, peripherin is a type III IF protein. Like \u03b1-internexin, peripherin is specific to the nervous system, but it is expressed predominantly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Peripherin can also self-assemble both in vitro and in transfected cells. It is as abundant as the NFTPs in the sciatic nerve and can be considered a fourth subunit of the neurofilaments in the PNS. Peripherin has multiple isoforms that arise from intron retention, cryptic intron receptor site or alternative translation initiation. The functional significance of these isoforms is not clear.

It is a highly dynamic system that plays crucial roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including migration, adhesion, cytokinesis, morphogenesis, intracellular traffic and signaling, and structural flexibility. Among the large number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins characterized to date, microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1) is arguably the most versatile integrator and modulator of cytoskeleton-related processes. MACF1 belongs to the plakin family of proteins, and within it, to the spectraplakin subfamily. These proteins are characterized by the ability to bridge MT and actin cytoskeletal networks in a dynamic fashion, which underlies their involvement in the regulation of cell migration, axonal extension, and vesicular traffic. Studying MACF1 functions has provided insights not only into the regulation of the cytoskeleton but also into molecular mechanisms of both normal cellular physiology and cellular pathology. Multiple MACF1 isoforms exist, composed of a large variety of alternatively spliced domains. Each of these domains mediates a specific set of interactions and functions. These functions are manifested in tissue and cell-specific phenotypes observed in conditional MACF1 knockout mice. The conditional models described to date reveal critical roles of MACF1 in mammalian skin, nervous system, heart muscle, and intestinal epithelia. Complete elimination of MACF1 is early embryonic lethal, indicating an essential role for MACF1 in early development. Further studies of MACF1 domains and their interactions will likely reveal multiple new roles of this protein in various tissues.", "Keywords": ["Actin filaments", "Calponin-homology domains", "Microtubules", "Plakins", "Spectraplakin", "Spectrin repeats"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Microfilament Proteins", "Organ Specificity", "Organelles", "Two-Hybrid System Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dmitry", "Last Name": "Goryunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald K H", "Last Name": "Liem", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA.

Patients suffer from degeneration of the peripheral nerves that control sensory information of the foot/leg and hand/arm. Multiple mutations in the neurofilament light polypeptide gene, NEFL, cause CMT2E. Previous studies in transfected cells showed that expression of disease-associated neurofilament light chain variants results in abnormal intermediate filament networks associated with defects in axonal transport. We have now generated knock-in mice with two different point mutations in Nefl: P8R that has been reported in multiple families with variable age of onset and N98S that has been described as an early-onset, sporadic mutation in multiple individuals. Nefl(P8R/+) and Nefl(P8R/P8R) mice were indistinguishable from Nefl(+/+) in terms of behavioral phenotype. In contrast, Nefl(N98S/+) mice had a noticeable tremor, and most animals showed a hindlimb clasping phenotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed multiple inclusions in the cell bodies and proximal axons of spinal cord neurons, disorganized processes in the cerebellum and abnormal processes in the cerebral cortex and pons. Abnormal processes were observed as early as post-natal day 7. Electron microscopic analysis of sciatic nerves showed a reduction in the number of neurofilaments, an increase in the number of microtubules and a decrease in the axonal diameters. The Nefl(N98S/+) mice provide an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of CMT2E and should prove useful for testing potential therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Humans", "Intermediate Filaments", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation, Missense", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Spinal Cord"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adijat A", "Last Name": "Adebola", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and."}, {"First Name": "Theo", "Last Name": "Di Castri", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Chui-Zhen", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Salvatierra", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Kristy", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and."}, {"First Name": "Howard J", "Last Name": "Worman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald K H", "Last Name": "Liem", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and rkl2@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2015Apr15"}, {"PMID": "25448007", "Title": "Axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease patient-derived motor neurons demonstrate disease-specific phenotypes including abnormal electrophysiological properties.", "Abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies associated with mutations or copy number variations in over 70 genes encoding proteins with fundamental roles in the development and function of Schwann cells and peripheral axons.

These proteins are members of the plakin family, giant multi-modular proteins able to connect the intermediate filament, microtubule and microfilament cytoskeletal networks with each other and to distinct cell membrane sites. They also serve as scaffolds for signaling proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics. To gain better insights into the functions of BPAG1a/b, we further characterized their C-terminal region important for their interaction with microtubules and assessed the role of these isoforms in the cytoskeletal organization of C2.7 myoblast cells. Our results show that alternative splicing does not only occur at the 5' end of Dst and Macf1 pre-mRNAs, as previously reported, but also at their 3' end, resulting in expression of additional four mRNA variants of BPAG1 and MACF1. These isoform-specific C-tails were able to bundle microtubules and bound to both EB1 and EB3, two microtubule plus end proteins. In the C2.7 cell line, knockdown of BPAG1a/b had no major effect on the organization of the microtubule and microfilament networks, but negatively affected endocytosis and maintenance of the Golgi apparatus structure, which became dispersed. Finally, knockdown of BPAG1a/b caused a specific decrease in the directness of cell migration, but did not impair initial cell adhesion.
