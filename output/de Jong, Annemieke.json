[{"PMID": "36550321", "Title": "Staphylococcal phosphatidylglycerol antigens activate human T cells via CD1a.", "Abstract": "Expressed on epidermal Langerhans cells, CD1a presents a range of self-lipid antigens found within the skin; however, the extent to which CD1a presents microbial ligands from bacteria colonizing the skin is unclear. Here we identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid, as well as to lysylPG, a modified PG, present in several Gram-positive bacteria and highly abundant in Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-PG complex showed that the acyl chains were buried within the A'- and F'-pockets of CD1a, while the phosphoglycerol headgroup remained solvent exposed in the F'-portal and was available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG and PG-loaded CD1a tetramers, we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to these lipids in a dose-dependent manner. Tetramer+CD4+\u2009T cell lines secreted type 2 helper T cell cytokines in response to phosphatidylglycerols as well as to co-cultures of CD1a+\u2009dendritic cells and Staphylococcus bacteria. The expansion in patients with atopic dermatitis of CD4+ CD1a-(lysyl)PG tetramer+ T cells suggests a response to lipids made by bacteria associated with atopic dermatitis and provides a link supporting involvement of PG-based lipid-activated T cells in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Dermatitis, Atopic", "Skin", "Langerhans Cells", "Antigens,

Here, we showed that CD1a tetramers without added antigen stained large T cell pools in every subject tested, accounting for approximately 1% of skin T cells. The mechanism of tetramer binding to T cells did not require any defined antigen. Binding occurred with approximately 100 lipid ligands carried by CD1a proteins, but could be tuned upward or downward with certain natural self-lipids. TCR recognition mapped to the outer A' roof of CD1a at sites remote from the antigen exit portal, explaining how TCRs can bind CD1a rather than carried lipids.

We aimed to determine the relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort (n\u2009=\u200952) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS+) bacteria previously linked to inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe periodontitis. Fungal \u03b1-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and plaque from patients with a history of AIDS. Our results show that both bacterial and fungal oral microbiome communities likely play a role in chronic systemic immune activation in PLWH. Thus, interventions targeting both inflammation and the microbiome, particularly in the oral cavity, may be necessary to reduce chronic immune dysregulation in patients with HIV.IMPORTANCE A feedback loop between dysbiotic gut microbiota, increased translocation of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide, and inflammation has been hypothesized to cause immune system dysfunction in early HIV infection. However, despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients.

Our transcriptional profiling of human and mouse alopecic skin showed that the IFN pathway is the dominant signaling pathway involved in AA.

Ubiquitin (Ub), alpha (\u03b1)-synuclein, p62/sequestosome 1, and oxidized proteins are the major components of Lewy bodies. However, the mechanisms involved in the impairment of misfolded/oxidized protein degradation pathways in PD are still unclear. PD is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and environmental pesticide exposure. In this work, we evaluated the effects of the pesticide paraquat (PQ) and the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) on Ub-dependent protein degradation pathways. No increase in the accumulation of Ub-bound proteins or aggregates was observed in dopaminergic cells (SK-N-SH) treated with PQ or MPP(+), or in mice chronically exposed to PQ. PQ decreased Ub protein content, but not its mRNA transcription. Protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide depleted Ub levels and potentiated PQ-induced cell death. The inhibition of proteasomal activity by PQ was found to be a late event in cell death progression and had neither effect on the toxicity of either MPP(+) or PQ, nor on the accumulation of oxidized sulfenylated, sulfonylated (DJ-1/PARK7 and peroxiredoxins), and carbonylated proteins induced by PQ. PQ- and MPP(+)-induced Ub protein depletion prompted the dimerization/inactivation of the Ub-binding protein p62 that regulates the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins by autophagy. We confirmed that PQ and MPP(+) impaired autophagy flux and that the blockage of autophagy by the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the autophagy protein 5 (dnAtg5) stimulated their toxicity, but there was no additional effect upon inhibition of the proteasome.

These noncontiguous epitopes are generated via a transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by the proteasomal active sites. Transpeptidation reactions in the proteasome follow explicit rules and occur particularly efficiently when the C-terminal ligation partner contains a lysine or arginine residue at the site of ligation. Lysine contains two amino groups that theoretically may both participate in ligation reactions, implying that potentially not only peptide but also isopeptide linkages could be formed. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate in the present study that the proteasome can use the \u03b5-amino group of an N-terminal lysine residue in transpeptidation reactions to create a novel type of posttranslationally modified epitopes. We show that the overall efficiency of \u03b5 ligation is only 10-fold lower as compared with \u03b1 ligation, suggesting that the proteasome can produce sufficient isopeptide Ag to evoke a T cell response. Additionally, we show that isopeptides are more stable toward further proteasomal processing than are normal peptides, and we demonstrate that isopeptides can bind to HLA-A2.1 and HLA-A3 with high affinity. These properties likely increase the fraction of \u03b5-ligated peptides presented on the cell surface for CD8(+) T cell surveillance. Finally, we show that isopeptide Ags are immunogenic in vivo.

The ability of T cells to 'see' lipid antigens bound to CD1 enables these lymphocytes to sense changes in the lipid composition of cells and tissues as a result of infections, inflammation, or malignancies. Although foreign lipid antigens have been shown to function as antigens for CD1-restricted T cells, many CD1-restricted T cells do not require foreign antigens for activation but instead can be activated by self-lipids presented by CD1. This review highlights recent developments in the field, including the identification of common mammalian lipids that function as autoantigens for \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, a novel mode of T-cell activation whereby CD1a itself rather than lipids serves as the autoantigen, and various mechanisms by which the activation of CD1-autoreactive T cells is regulated.

Outside the major histocompatibility complex, we identify two novel loci that exceed the threshold of statistical significance, containing ACOXL/BCL2L11(BIM) (2q13); GARP (LRRC32) (11q13.5), as well as a third nominally significant region SH2B3(LNK)/ATXN2 (12q24.12).

This finding was explained by demonstrating that bee venom-derived phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activates T cells through generation of small neoantigens, such as free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, from common phosphodiacylglycerides. Patient studies showed that injected PLA2 generates lysophospholipids within human skin in vivo, and polyclonal T cell responses are dependent on CD1a protein and PLA2.

Moving beyond in vitro studies, the recent development of human CD1a, CD1b, CD1c and MR1 tetramers allows direct and specific enumeration of lipid-reactive and small molecule-reactive T cells, providing a new approach to study of T cell-mediated diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Antigens, CD1", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Humans", "Lipids", "Minor Histocompatibility Antigens", "Protein Binding", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emilie", "Last Name": "Layre", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 1 Jimmy Fund Way, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annemieke", "Last Name": "de Jong", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Dermatology, Russ Berrie Medical Science Pavilion, 1150 St Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David Branch", "Last Name": "Moody", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 1 Jimmy Fund Way, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The immune pathways required for autoreactive T cell activation in AA are not defined limiting clinical development of rational targeted therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicated ligands for the NKG2D receptor (product of the KLRK1 gene) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) response and upregulation of several \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c) cytokines known to promote the activation and survival of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells. Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-\u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-15 receptor \u03b2 (IL-15R\u03b2) prevented disease development, reducing the accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b3c cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK inhibition in human AA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alopecia Areata", "Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Janus Kinases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Skin", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luzhou", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

TLR signaling cascades induce production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines involved in establishing an anti-viral state as well as in orchestrating ensuing adaptive immunity. To allow infection, replication, and persistence, (herpes)viruses employ ingenious strategies to evade host immunity. The human gamma-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a large, enveloped DNA virus persistently carried by more than 90% of adults worldwide. It is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several malignant tumors. EBV activates TLRs, including TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9. Interestingly, both the expression of and signaling by TLRs is attenuated during productive EBV infection. Ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating TLR signaling and is controlled by ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs). The EBV genome encodes three proteins reported to exert in vitro deubiquitinase activity. Using active site-directed probes, we show that one of these putative DUBs, the conserved herpesvirus large tegument protein BPLF1, acts as a functional DUB in EBV-producing B cells. The BPLF1 enzyme is expressed during the late phase of lytic EBV infection and is incorporated into viral particles. The N-terminal part of the large BPLF1 protein contains the catalytic site for DUB activity and suppresses TLR-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB at, or downstream of, the TRAF6 signaling intermediate. A catalytically inactive mutant of this EBV protein did not reduce NF-\u03baB activation, indicating that DUB activity is essential for attenuating TLR signal transduction. Our combined results show that EBV employs deubiquitination of signaling intermediates in the TLR cascade as a mechanism to counteract innate anti-viral immunity of infected hosts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Epstein-Barr Virus Infections", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Herpesvirus 4, Human", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunoblotting", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptors", "Transfection", "Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michiel", "Last Name": "van Gent", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven G E", "Last Name": "Braem", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Annemieke", "Last Name": "de Jong", "Affiliation": "Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Nezira", "Last Name": "Delagic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Maynooth, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Janneke G C", "Last Name": "Peeters", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Ingrid G J", "Last Name": "Boer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Paul N", "Last Name": "Moynagh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Maynooth, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Kremmer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel J", "Last Name": "Wiertz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Huib", "Last Name": "Ovaa", "Affiliation": "Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bryan D", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Maaike E", "Last Name": "Ressing", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands ; Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24362891", "Title": "CD1a-autoreactive T cells recognize natural skin oils that function as headless antigens.", "Abstract": "T cells autoreactive to the antigen-presenting molecule CD1a are common in human blood and skin, but the search for natural autoantigens has been confounded by background T cell responses to CD1 proteins and self lipids.
