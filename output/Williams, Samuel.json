The HS microbiome is polymicrobial with an abundance of commensal gram-positive facultative (GPs) Staphylococcus species and gram-negative anaerobic (GNA) bacteria like Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas with increasing predominance of GNAs with disease severity. We sought to define the keratinocyte response to bacteria commonly isolated from HS lesions to probe pathogenic relationships between HS and the microbiome. Type strains of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as Staphylococcus aureus and the normal skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis were heat-killed and co-incubated with normal human keratinocytes. RNA was collected and analysed using RNAseq and RT-qPCR. The supernatant was collected from cell culture for protein quantification. Transcriptomic profiles between HS clinical samples and stimulated keratinocytes were compared. Co-staining of patient HS frozen sections was used to localize bacteria in lesions. A mouse intradermal injection model was used to investigate early immune recruitment. TLR4 and JAK inhibitors were used to investigate mechanistic avenues of bacterial response inhibition. GNAs, especially F.\u2009nucleatum, stimulated vastly higher CXCL8, IL17C, CCL20, IL6, TNF and IL36\u03b3 transcription in normal skin keratinocytes than the GPs S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Using RNAseq, we found that F.\u2009nucleatum (and Prevotella) strongly induced the IL-17 pathway in keratinocytes and overlapped with transcriptome profiles of HS patient clinical samples. Bacteria were juxtaposed to activated keratinocytes in\u00a0vivo, and F.\u2009nucleatum strongly recruited murine neutrophil and macrophage migration. Both the TLR4 and pan-JAK inhibitors reduced cytokine production. Detailed transcriptomic profiling of healthy skin keratinocytes exposed to GNAs prevalent in HS revealed a potent, extensive inflammatory response vastly stronger than GPs. GNAs stimulated HS-relevant genes, including many genes in the IL-17 response pathway, and were significantly associated with HS tissue transcriptomes. The close association of activated keratinocytes with bacteria in HS lesions and innate infiltration in murine skin cemented GNA pathogenic potential. These novel mechanistic insights could drive future targeted therapies.", "Keywords": ["barrier response", "hidradenitis suppurativa", "immunology", "keratinocytes", "microbiome"], "MeSH terms": ["Keratinocytes", "Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Hidradenitis Suppurativa", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Staphylococcus epidermidis", "Fusobacterium nucleatum", "Transcriptome", "Cytokines", "Bacteria, Anaerobic", "Interleukin-17", "Microbiota", "Prevotella"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel C", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Garcet", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shunsuke", "Last Name": "Miura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juana", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Navrazhina", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mika", "Last Name": "Yamamura-Murai", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kazuhiko", "Last Name": "Yamamura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Frew", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincent A", "Last Name": "Fischetti", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uri", "Last Name": "Sela", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "James G", "Last Name": "Krueger", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Experimental dermatology", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38654348", "Title": "From little things big things grow: enhancement of an acoustic telemetry network to monitor broad-scale movements of marine species along Australia's east coast.", "Abstract": "Acoustic telemetry has become a fundamental tool to monitor the movement of aquatic species.

facilitate nutrient and waste exchange and, importantly, provide a route for metastasis from a primary to a secondary site. Whilst current models can ensure the transport and exchange of nutrients and waste via diffusion over distances greater than 200\u00a0\u03bcm, many lack sufficient vasculature capable of recapitulating the tumour microenvironment and, thus, metastasis. In this study, we utilise gelatin-containing polymerised high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) templated polycaprolactone-methacrylate (PCL-M) scaffolds to fabricate a composite material to support the 3D culture of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and vascular ingrowth. Firstly, we investigated the effect of gelatin within the scaffolds on the mechanical and chemical properties using compression testing and FTIR spectroscopy, respectively. Initial in vitro assessment of cell metabolic activity and vascular endothelial growth factor expression demonstrated that gelatin-containing PCL-M polyHIPEs are capable of supporting 3D breast cancer cell growth. We then utilised the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay to assess the angiogenic potential of cell-seeded gelatin-containing PCL-M polyHIPEs, and vascular ingrowth within cell-seeded, surfactant and gelatin-containing scaffolds was investigated via histological staining. Overall, our study proposes a promising composite material to fabricate a substrate to support the 3D culture of cancer cells and vascular ingrowth.", "Keywords": ["CAM assay", "PCL (polycaprolactone)", "angiogenesis", "gelatin", "polyHIPE", "vascularisation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caitlin E", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "The Kroto Research Institute, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Iona", "Last Name": "Doyle", "Affiliation": "The Kroto Research Institute, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Hamood", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The Kroto Research Institute, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Samuel F", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Bet\u00fcl", "Last Name": "Aldemir Dikici", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Izmir Institute of Technology, Urla, T\u00fcrkiye."}, {"First Name": "Edgar", "Last Name": "Barajas Ledesma", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Bryant", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "William R", "Last Name": "English", "Affiliation": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nicola H", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "The Kroto Research Institute, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Frederik", "Last Name": "Claeyssens", "Affiliation": "The Kroto Research Institute, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "38051841", "Title": "International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) - Report from the 2022 Annual Meeting.", "Abstract": "The International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of evidence-based, consensus-driven outcome measures in dermatological diseases.

In-depth molecular analysis of neoplastic melanocytes in whole tissue biopsies may be diluted by inflammatory infiltration, which may obscure gene signatures specific to neoplastic cells. Thus, a method is needed to precisely uncover molecular changes specific to tumor cells from a limited sample of primary melanomas. Here, we performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) and gene expression profiling of patient-derived frozen sections of pigmented lesions and primary cutaneous melanoma. Compared to bulk tissue analysis, analysis of LCM-derived samples identified 9528 additional differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including melanocyte-specific genes like PMEL and TYR, with enriched of pathways related to cell proliferation. LCM methodology also identified potentially targetable kinases specific to melanoma cells that were not detected by bulk tissue analysis.

Fully automated systems would enable simultaneous, large-scale capturing of bee activity patterns from multiple hives, providing vital data for ecological research and business practice improvement. Data from a Doppler radar were gathered from managed beehives on a farm. Recordings were split into 0.4 s windows, and Log Area Ratios (LARs) were computed from the data. Support vector machine models were trained to recognize flight behavior from the LARs, using visual confirmation recorded by a camera. Spectrogram deep learning was also investigated using the same data. Once complete, this process would allow for removing the camera and accurately counting the events by radar-based machine learning alone. Challenging signals from more complex bee flights hindered progress.

However, many widely distributed species consists of distinct populations throughout their distribution, evidencing that our understanding of how the marine environment triggers population and species divergence are insufficient. The sailfish is a circumtropical and highly migratory billfish that inhabits warm and productive areas. Despite its ecological and socioeconomic importance as a predator and fishery resource, the species is threatened by overfishing, requiring innovative approaches to improve their management and conservation status. Thus, we presented a novel high-quality reference genome for the species and applied a seascape genomics approach to understand how marine environmental features may promote local adaptation and how it affects gene flow between populations. We delimit two populations between the Atlantic and Indo-Western Pacific oceans and detect outlier loci correlated with sea surface temperature, salinity, oxygen, and chlorophyll concentrations. However, the most significant explanatory factor that explains the differences between populations was isolation by distance. Despite recent population drops, the sailfish populations are not inbred. For billfishes in general, genome-wide heterozygosity was found to be relatively low compared to other marine fishes, evidencing the need to counteract overfishing effects. In addition, in a climate change scenario, management agencies must implement state-of-the-art sequencing methods, consider our findings in their management plans, and monitor genome-wide heterozygosity over time to improve sustainable fisheries and the long-term viability of its populations.", "Keywords": ["demographic history", "fisheries management units", "genome-wide heterozygosity", "reference genome assembly", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Phylogeography", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Fisheries", "Genomics", "Perciformes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bruno Lopes da Silva", "Last Name": "Ferrette", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Raphael T F", "Last Name": "Coimbra", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sven", "Last Name": "Winter", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Menno J", "Last Name": "De Jong", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Samuel Mackey", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Coelho", "Affiliation": "Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA), Olh\u00e3o, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Rosa", "Affiliation": "Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA), Olh\u00e3o, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Matheus Marcos", "Last Name": "Rotundo", "Affiliation": "Acervo Zool\u00f3gico (AZUSC), Universidade Santa Cec\u00edlia (UNISANTA), Santos, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Freddy", "Last Name": "Arocha", "Affiliation": "Instituto Oceanogr\u00e1fico de Venezuela, Universidad de Oriente (UDO), Caman\u00e1, Venezuela."}, {"First Name": "Bruno Leite", "Last Name": "Mourato", "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Ci\u00eancias da Pesca (LABPESCA), Instituto do Mar (IMar), Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), Campus Baixada Santista, Santos, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Fernando Fernandes", "Last Name": "Mendon\u00e7a", "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Gen\u00e9tica Pesqueira e Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o (GenPesC), Instituto do Mar (IMar), Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), Campus Baixada Santista, Santos, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Axel", "Last Name": "Janke", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}], "Journal": "Genome biology and evolution", "PubDate": "2023Apr06"}, {"PMID": "36454070", "Title": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and the risk of perioperative euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis.", "Abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Women of reproductive age in rural Sierra Leone's Western area were asked to participate in a survey to determine their attitudes and knowledge toward family planning and the use of contraceptives. A descriptive cross-sectional study survey was conducted in the Western Area Rural of Sierra Leone. Females in the range of 15 to 49 years old were included in the study. The research was conducted from November 2021 to December 2021. Using a pre-designed and pretested questionnaire, 180 women were assessed for their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding family planning. According to the study, all participants knew about family planning, but only 68.3% had used contraceptives. There were more than half who learned about it from the media. The study found that 95% of participants had a positive attitude towards contraceptives. Most commonly, contraceptives used were oral pills (31.6), injections (21.1%), implants (19.1%), lactational amenorrhea (13.8%), condoms (8.8%), and intrauterine devices (5%). In our study, the most common reasons given by participants for not using contraceptives were; not willing to disclose 52.6%, a desire for a child 19.2%, fear of side effects 15.7%, currently pregnant 8.7%, and against religious beliefs 3.5%. The study shows that even if people are aware and educated about contraceptives, they may not use them.

Nine hundred and twenty four non-ICU and 103 ICU patients were included (cohort 1). The median PCT was higher in proven vs. absent/low-suspicion of bacterial co-infection.

We studied a patient with inherited PD-1 deficiency and TB who died of pulmonary autoimmunity. The patient's leukocytes did not express PD-1 or respond to PD-1-mediated suppression. The patient's lymphocytes produced only small amounts of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 upon mycobacterial stimuli, similarly to patients with inborn errors of IFN-\u03b3 production who are vulnerable to TB. This phenotype resulted from a combined depletion of V\u03b42+ \u03b3\u03b4 T, mucosal-associated invariant T and CD56bright natural killer lymphocytes and dysfunction of other T lymphocyte subsets. Moreover, the patient displayed hepatosplenomegaly and an expansion of total, activated and ROR\u03b3T+ CD4-CD8- double-negative \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, similar to patients with STAT3 gain-of-function mutations who display lymphoproliferative autoimmunity. This phenotype resulted from excessive amounts of STAT3-activating cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-23 produced by activated T lymphocytes and monocytes, and the STAT3-dependent expression of ROR\u03b3T by activated T lymphocytes.

species are responsible for depredating catches. This research aimed to identify depredating species in Southeast Queensland\u00a0line based fisheries, by undertaking a genetic analysis of depredated samples collected by commercial, charter and recreational fishers. The genetic analysis successfully identified ten depredating sharks, all from the genus Carcharhinus (19.2% success). The species identified using mitochondrial DNA included five C. leucas (bull sharks), two C. plumbeus (sandbar sharks), one C. amboinensis (pigeye shark), one C. brevipinna (spinner shark) and one unconfirmed C. plumbeus/C. altimus (bignose shark). While many species of Carcharhinus have been found to depredate catches in Australia, C. leucas has not been highlighted until this research as a potential problematic species.

While infectious organisms have been identified in lesions of the disease since the 1980s, questions remain over the role that bacteria and microbiome play. Recent studies using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and larger culture-based studies have begun to paint a clearer picture of the microbial world of HS. With this systematic review, we summarize all the work that has been done to date in HS bacteriology, analyse potential pitfalls and limitations of the current studies, and address future directions of investigation. This systematic review attempted to collate and analyse all bacteriology studies done to date. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (1670769) performed in line with the PRISMA checklist. Twenty two studies were identified comprising 862 individual HS patients for culture studies and 206 HS patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. Methodology tended to be varied, with different sampling, culturing and sequencing methods as well as amount of analysis and stratification of patients. Bacteria identified as elevated in HS lesions in sequencing studies as well as grown from HS lesions in culture studies are identified and discussed. These primarily included the anerobic Gram-negative bacilli Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Fusibacterium, the Gram-positive bacilli Corynebacterium, and the Gram-positive cocci Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Parvimonas. Potential interactions, as well as work in other disease models with related bacteria are also discussed.

Using the R.E.C.U.R.-database, frequency of imaging was studied in regard to prognostic risk groups. Furthermore, it was investigated whether imaging modality utilized in contemporary follow-up were associated with outcome after detection of recurrence. Moreover, outcome was compared based on whether the assessment of potential curability was a pre-defined set of criteria's (per-protocol) or stated by the investigator. Materials and methods: Consecutive non-metastatic R.C.C. patients (n\u2009=\u20091,612) treated with curative intent at 12 institutes across eight European countries between 2006 and 2011 were included. Leibovich or U.I.S.S. risk group, recurrence characteristics, imaging modality, frequency and survival were recorded. Primary endpoints were overall survival (O.S.) after detection of recurrence and frequency of features associated with favourable outcome (non-symptomatic recurrences and detection within the follow-up-programme). Results: Recurrence occurred in 336 patients. Within low, intermediate and high risk for recurrence groups, the frequency of follow-up imaging was highest in the early phase of follow-up and decreased significantly over time (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, neither the image modality for detection nor \u2265 50% cross-sectional imaging during follow-up were associated with improved O.S. after recurrence. Differences between per protocol and investigator based assessment of curability did not translate into differences in O.S. Conclusions: As expected, the frequency of imaging was highest during early follow-up. Cross-sectional imaging use for detection of recurrences following surgery for localized R.C.C. did not improve O.S. post-recurrence.

Using the RECUR database, we studied imaging intensity utilised in contemporary FU to evaluate its association with outcome after detection of disease recurrence. Consecutive patients with nonmetastatic RCC (n=1612) treated with curative intent at 12 institutes across eight European countries between 2006 and 2011 were included. Recurrence occurred in 336 patients. Cross-sectional (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and conventional (chest X-ray, ultrasound) methods were used in 47% and 53%, respectively. More intensive FU imaging (more than twofold) than recommended by the European Association of Urology (EAU) was not associated with improved overall survival (OS) after recurrence. Overall, per patient treated for recurrence remaining alive with no evidence of disease, the number of FU images needed was 542, and 697 for high-risk patients. The study results suggest that use of more imaging during FU than that recommended in the 2017 EAU guidelines is unlikely to improve OS after recurrence. Prospective studies are needed to design optimal FU strategies for the future. PATIENT SUMMARY: After curative treatment for localised kidney cancer, follow-up is necessary to detect any recurrence.

Modelling of environmental variables revealed location, sea-surface height deviation, mixed layer depth and dissolved oxygen to all be significant predictors of vertical habitat use. Distinct differences in diel movements were observed between the size classes, with larger size classes of marlin (greater than 50\u2009kg) undertaking predictable bounce-diving activity during daylight hours, while diving behaviour of the smallest size class occurred randomly during both day and night. Overall, larger size classes of I. indica were found to use an increased thermal range and spend more time in waters below 150\u2009m than fish of smaller size classes. The differences in the diving behaviour among size classes were suggested to reflect ontogenetic differences in foraging behaviour or physiology. The findings of this study demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, ontogenetic differences in vertical habitat in a species of billfish, and further the understanding of pelagic fish ecophysiology in the presence of global environmental change.", "Keywords": ["billfish", "diving behaviour", "ontogeny", "physiology", "telemetry"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel M", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Bonnie J", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Tracey", "Affiliation": "Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Julian G", "Last Name": "Pepperell", "Affiliation": "Pepperell Research and Consulting Pty Ltd, P.O.

Functional metal oxides are no exception - protonic-defect-conducting oxides find use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and oxygen-deficient high-temperature superconductors are poised for power transmission and magnetic imaging applications. Similarly, the advantageous functional responses in ferroelectric materials that make\u00a0them attractive for use in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), logic elements, and environmental energy harvesting, are derived from interactions of defects with other defects (such as domain walls) and with the lattice. Chemical doping has traditionally been employed to study the effects of defects in functional materials, but complications arising from compositional heterogeneity often make interpretation of results difficult. Alternatively, irradiation is a versatile means of evaluating defect interactions while avoiding the complexities of doping. Here, a generalized phenomenological model is developed to quantify defect interactions and compare material performance in functional oxides as a function of radiation dose. The model is demonstrated with historical data from literature on ferroelectrics, and expanded to functional materials for SOFCs, mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs), He-ion implantation, and superconductors.

We demonstrate that protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a highly conserved but catalytically inactive receptor tyrosine kinase in the Wnt signaling pathway, is enriched on TICs in low-passage TNBC, OVCA, and NSCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). To deliver a potent anticancer drug to PTK7-expressing TICs, we generated a targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized anti-PTK7 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable valine-citrulline-based linker, and Aur0101, an auristatin microtubule inhibitor. The PTK7-targeted ADC induced sustained tumor regressions and outperformed standard-of-care chemotherapy. Moreover, the ADC specifically reduced the frequency of TICs, as determined by serial transplantation experiments. In addition to reducing the TIC frequency, the PTK7-targeted ADC may have additional antitumor mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of angiogenesis and the stimulation of immune cells. Together, these preclinical data demonstrate the potential for the PTK7-targeted ADC to improve the long-term survival of cancer patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aminobenzoates", "Animals",

Therapies that effectively target and kill tumor-initiating cells (TICs) in these cancers should translate to improved patient survival. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors serve as excellent models to study tumor biology and characterize TICs. Increased expression of delta-like 3 (DLL3) was discovered in SCLC and LCNEC PDX tumors and confirmed in primary SCLC and LCNEC tumors. DLL3 protein is expressed on the surface of tumor cells but not in normal adult tissues. A DLL3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), SC16LD6.5, comprised of a humanized anti-DLL3 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a DNA-damaging pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer toxin, induced durable tumor regression in vivo across multiple PDX models. Serial transplantation experiments executed with limiting dilutions of cells provided functional evidence confirming that the lack of tumor recurrence after SC16LD6.5 exposure resulted from effective targeting of DLL3-expressing TICs. In vivo efficacy correlated with DLL3 expression, and responses were observed in PDX models initiated from patients with both limited and extensive-stage disease and were independent of their sensitivity to standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. SC16LD6.5 effectively targets and eradicates DLL3-expressing TICs in SCLC and LCNEC PDX tumors and is a promising first-in-class ADC for the treatment of high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoconjugates", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lung Neoplasms", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura R", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander J", "Last Name": "Bankovich", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wade C", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monette A", "Last Name": "Aujay", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Bheddah", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "KristenAnn", "Last Name": "Black", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Radhika", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Escarpe", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Hampl", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Laysang", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Javier", "Last Name": "Lopez-Molina", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Milly", "Last Name": "Milton", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marybeth A", "Last Name": "Pysz", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Slingerland", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Torgov", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Orit", "Last Name": "Foord", "Affiliation": "Stemcentrx Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "Spirogen (a member of the AstraZeneca Group), London W2 6BD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jacek", "Last Name": "Jassem", "Affiliation": "Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk 82-300, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Andrzej", "Last Name": "Badzio", "Affiliation": "Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk 82-300, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Piotr", "Last Name": "Czapiewski", "Affiliation": "Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk 82-300, Poland."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Harpole", "Affiliation": "Duke University Medical Cancer, Durham, NC 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Afshin", "Last Name": "Dowlati", "Affiliation": "Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pierre P", "Last Name": "Massion", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Program, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Tennessee Valley Healthcare Systems, Nashville Campus, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "William D", "Last Name": "Travis", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Catherine", "Last Name": "Pietanza", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

However, few studies have examined the impact of HIV on cognition in young adults (18-24 years old). Yet, this group is one of the largest populations of individuals with new HIV infection. Young adulthood is also an important developmental window because the brain has not fully matured and individuals are prone to engage in risky behavior. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of HIV on neurocognition and risky behaviors. We hypothesized that HIV+ young adults (n\u2009=\u200923) would exhibit greater cognitive impairment and risky behaviors compared to seronegative controls (n\u2009=\u200921). In addition, we predicted that self-reported risky behavior as assessed by the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB) would covary with cognitive performances. Results revealed poorer executive function in HIV+ young adults compared to seronegative (HIV-) controls. HIV+ young adults exhibited significantly greater risk scores on the RAB (p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to HIV- young adults. However, there were no relationships between risky behavior and cognitive performance. Overall, our results suggest that HIV is associated with poorer cognition and increased risky behaviors in young adults.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Risk-Taking", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laurie M", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Missouri-Saint Louis, One University Blvd, Stadler 325, St. Louis, MO, 62121, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jodi M", "Last Name": "Heaps", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Westerhaus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jee Yoon", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Brier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katie", "Last Name": "Plax", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beau M", "Last Name": "Ances", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurovirology", "PubDate": "2014Oct"}, {"PMID": "24660926", "Title": "The complete validated mitochondrial genome of the black marlin Istiompax indica (Cuvier, 1832).", "Abstract": "Two complete mitochondrial genomes of the black marlin Istiompax indica were assembled from approximately 3.5 and 2.5 million reads produced by Ion Torrent next generation sequencing.

Tumor histopathology can differ significantly among patients and cellular heterogeneity within tumors is common. A primary goal of cancer biologists is to better understand tumorigenesis and cancer progression; however, the complex nature of tumors has posed a substantial challenge to unlocking cancer's secrets. The cancer stem cell (CSC) paradigm for the pathobiology of solid tumors appropriately acknowledges phenotypic and functional tumor cell heterogeneity observed in solid tumors and accounts for the disconnect between drug approval based on response and the general inability of approved therapies to meaningfully impact survival due to their failure to eradicate these most important of cellular targets. First proposed to exist decades ago, CSC have only recently begun to be precisely identified due to technical advancements that facilitate identification, isolation, and interrogation of distinct tumor cell subpopulations with differing ability to form and perpetuate tumors. Precise identification of CSC populations and the complete hierarchy of cells within solid tumors will facilitate more accurate characterization of patient subtypes and ultimately contribute to more personalized and effective therapies. Rapid advancement in the understanding of tumor biology as it exists in patients requires cooperation among institutions, surgeons, pathologists, cancer biologists and patients alike, primarily because this translational research is best done with patient-derived tissue grown in the xenograft setting as patient-derived xenografts. This review calls for a broader change in the approaches taken to study cancer pathobiology, highlights what implications the CSC paradigm has for pathologists and cancer biologists alike, and calls for greater collaboration between institutions, physicians and scientists in order to more rapidly advance our collective understanding of cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Medical Oncology", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Neoplasms", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Transplantation, Heterologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology, Stem CentRx, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wade C", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marianne T", "Last Name": "Santaguida", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott J", "Last Name": "Dylla", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}]
