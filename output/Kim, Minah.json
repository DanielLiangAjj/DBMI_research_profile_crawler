Inspired by a brain model in which the inferior frontal cortex selectively gates the putamen to guide goal-directed or habitual actions, this study aimed to examine whether disruptions in the arbitration process via the fronto-striatal circuit would underlie imbalanced decision-making and compulsions in patients. Thirty patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [mean (standard deviation) age = 26.93 (6.23) years, 12 females (40%)] and 30 healthy controls [mean (standard deviation) age = 24.97 (4.72) years, 17 females (57%)] underwent functional MRI scans while performing the two-step Markov decision task, which was designed to dissociate goal-directed behaviour from habitual behaviour. We employed a neurocomputational model to account for an uncertainty-based arbitration process, in which a prefrontal arbitrator (i.e. inferior frontal gyrus) allocates behavioural control to a more reliable strategy by selectively gating the putamen. We analysed group differences in the neural estimates of uncertainty of each strategy. We also compared the psychophysiological interaction effects of system preference (goal-directed versus habitual) on fronto-striatal coupling between groups. We examined the correlation between compulsivity score and the neural activity and connectivity involved in the arbitration process. The computational model captured the subjects' preferences between the strategies. Compared with healthy controls, patients had a stronger preference for the habitual system (t = -2.88, P = 0.006), which was attributed to a more uncertain goal-directed system (t = 2.72, P = 0.009). Before the allocation of controls, patients exhibited hypoactivity in the inferior frontal gyrus compared with healthy controls when this region tracked the inverse of uncertainty (i.e. reliability) of goal-directed behaviour (P = 0.001, family-wise error rate corrected). When reorienting behaviours to reach specific goals, patients exhibited weaker right ipsilateral ventrolateral prefronto-putamen coupling than healthy controls (P = 0.001, family-wise error rate corrected). This hypoconnectivity was correlated with more severe compulsivity (r = -0.57, P = 0.002). Our findings suggest that the attenuated top-down control of the putamen by the prefrontal arbitrator underlies compulsivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Enhancing fronto-striatal connectivity may be a potential neurotherapeutic approach for compulsivity and adaptive decision-making.", "Keywords": ["arbitration", "compulsivity", "goal-directed behaviour", "neurocomputational model", "obsessive-compulsive disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Adult", "Male", "Goals", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Uncertainty", "Decision Making", "Young Adult", "Models, Neurological", "Compulsive Behavior", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Putamen", "Brain", "Computer Simulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taekwan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sang Wan", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Silvia Kyungjin", "Last Name": "Lho", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sun-Young", "Last Name": "Moon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jun Soo", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2024Jun03"}, {"PMID": "38569589", "Title": "Comparative Study of the Efficacy and Side Effects of Brand-Name and Generic Clozapine for Long-Term Maintenance Treatment Among Korean Patients With Schizophrenia: A Retrospective Naturalistic Mirror-Image Study.", "Abstract": "Clozapine is considered the most reliable drug for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

value-added chemicals receives considerable attention in recent years. Copper (Cu) is recognized as the only element capable of electro-reducing CO2 into hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms (C2+), but the low product selectivity of the Cu-based catalyst remains a major technological challenge to overcome. Therefore, identification of the structural features of Cu-based catalysts is of great importance for the highly selective production of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol, etc.), and the oxidation state of Cu species in the catalysts is found critical to the catalyst performance. This review introduces recent efforts to fine-tune the oxidation state of Cu to increase carbon capture and produce specific C2+ compounds, with the intention of greatly expediting the advance in the catalyst designs. It also points to the remaining challenges and fruitful research directions for the development of Cu-based catalysts that can shape the practical CO2 reduction technology.", "Keywords": ["CO2 reduction", "copper", "electrocatalysts", "oxidation state, selectivity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minki", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Joyjit", "Last Name": "Kundu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Green-Nano Materials Research Center, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Duck Hyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Dongyong", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kwangyeol", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sang-Il", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Green-Nano Materials Research Center, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38332374", "Title": "Using brain structural neuroimaging measures to predict psychosis onset for individuals at clinical high-risk.", "Abstract": "Machine learning approaches using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can be informative for disease classification, although their ability to predict psychosis is largely unknown. We created a model with individuals at CHR who developed psychosis later (CHR-PS+) from healthy controls (HCs) that can differentiate each other. We also evaluated whether we could distinguish CHR-PS+ individuals from those who did not develop psychosis later (CHR-PS-) and those with uncertain follow-up status (CHR-UNK). T1-weighted structural brain MRI scans from 1165 individuals at CHR (CHR-PS+, n\u2009=\u2009144; CHR-PS-, n\u2009=\u2009793; and CHR-UNK, n\u2009=\u2009228), and 1029 HCs, were obtained from 21 sites. We used ComBat to harmonize measures of subcortical volume, cortical thickness and surface area data and corrected for non-linear effects of age and sex using a general additive model. CHR-PS+ (n\u2009=\u2009120) and HC (n\u2009=\u2009799) data from 20 sites served as a training dataset, which we used to build a classifier. The remaining samples were used external validation datasets to evaluate classifier performance (test, independent confirmatory, and independent group [CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK] datasets). The accuracy of the classifier on the training and independent confirmatory datasets was 85% and 73% respectively. Regional cortical surface area measures-including those from the right superior frontal, right superior temporal, and bilateral insular cortices strongly contributed to classifying CHR-PS+ from HC. CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK individuals were more likely to be classified as HC compared to CHR-PS+ (classification rate to HC: CHR-PS+, 30%; CHR-PS-, 73%; CHR-UNK, 80%). We used multisite sMRI to train a classifier to predict psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and it showed promise predicting CHR-PS+ in an independent sample.

disorder across 1653 individuals: machine learning findings from the ENIGMA OCD Working Group.", "Abstract": "White matter pathways, typically studied with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been implicated in the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, due to limited sample sizes and the predominance of single-site studies, the generalizability of OCD classification based on diffusion white matter estimates remains unclear. Here, we tested classification accuracy using the largest OCD DTI dataset to date, involving 1336 adult participants (690 OCD patients and 646 healthy controls) and 317 pediatric participants (175 OCD patients and 142 healthy controls) from 18 international sites within the ENIGMA OCD Working Group. We used an automatic machine learning pipeline (with feature engineering and selection, and model optimization) and examined the cross-site generalizability of the OCD classification models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Our models showed low-to-moderate accuracy in classifying (1) \"OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve\u2009=\u200957.19\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47 in the replication set; Children, 59.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39), (2) \"unmedicated OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, 62.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.84; Children, 48.51\u2009\u00b1\u200910.14), and (3) \"medicated OCD vs. unmedicated OCD\" (Adults, 76.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.97; Children, 72.45\u2009\u00b1\u20098.87). There was significant site variability in model performance (cross-validated ROC AUC ranges 51.6-79.1 in adults; 35.9-63.2 in children). Machine learning interpretation showed that diffusivity measures of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and posterior thalamic radiation contributed to the classification of OCD from HC. The classification performance appeared greater than the model trained on grey matter morphometry in the prior ENIGMA OCD study (our study includes subsamples from the morphometry study). Taken together, this study points to the meaningful multivariate patterns of white matter features relevant to the neurobiology of OCD, but with low-to-moderate classification accuracy. The OCD classification performance may be constrained by site variability and medication effects on the white matter integrity, indicating room for improvement for future research.", "Keywords": [],

Dopamine is thought to underlie connectivity changes, but experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Previous studies examined the association in some of the connections using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI); however, PET has disadvantages in scanning patients, such as invasiveness. Excessive dopamine induces neuromelanin (NM) accumulation, and NM-MRI is suggested as a noninvasive proxy measure of dopamine function. We aimed to investigate the association between NM and FST circuit connectivity at the network level in patients with schizophrenia. We analysed substantia nigra NM-MRI and resting-state fMRI data from 29 schizophrenia patients and 63 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We identified the FST subnetwork with abnormal connectivity found in schizophrenia patients compared to that of HCs and investigated the relationship between constituting connectivity and NM-MRI signal. We found a higher NM signal (t\u2009=\u2009-2.12, p\u2009=\u20090.037) and a hypoconnected FST subnetwork (FWER-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.014) in schizophrenia patients than in HCs.

We demonstrated the association between NM and FST circuit connectivity.

However, the emergence of drug resistance limits their long-term efficacy. Here, we show that breast cancer cells develop CDK4/6i resistance via a sequential two-step process of E2F activation. This process entails retinoblastoma (Rb)-protein degradation, followed by c-Myc-mediated amplification of E2F transcriptional activity. CDK4/6i treatment halts cell proliferation in an Rb-dependent manner but dramatically reduces Rb-protein levels. However, this reduction in Rb levels insufficiently induces E2F activity. To develop CDK4/6i resistance, upregulation or activating mutations in mitogenic or hormone signaling are required to stabilize c-Myc levels, thereby augmenting E2F activity. Our analysis of pre-treatment tumor samples reveals a strong correlation between c-Myc levels, rather than Rb levels, and poor therapeutic outcomes after CDK4/6i treatment.

We identified angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) as one of the most upregulated angiogenic factors in RNA-Seq data from human PanNET liver metastases and found that higher ANGPT2 expression correlated with poor survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that ANGPT2 was localized to the endothelial cells of blood vessels in PanNET liver metastases. We observed an association between the upregulation of endothelial ANGPT2 and liver metastatic progression in both patients and transgenic mouse models of PanNETs. In human and mouse PanNET liver metastases, ANGPT2 upregulation coincided with poor T cell infiltration, indicative of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, both pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion of ANGPT2 in PanNET mouse models slowed the growth of PanNET liver metastases. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of ANGPT2 promoted T cell infiltration and activation in liver metastases, improving the survival of mice with metastatic PanNETs. These changes were accompanied by reduced plasma leakage and improved vascular integrity in metastases.

Despite the critical nature, research regarding the development of pneumonia during initial clozapine titration remains limited. This retrospective study included 1408 Korean inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Data were collected from January 2000 to January 2023. Pneumonia developed in 3.5\u00a0% of patients within 8\u00a0weeks of clozapine initiation. Patients who developed pneumonia were taking a greater number and higher dose of antipsychotics at baseline (2.14 vs. 1.58, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 25.64 vs. 19.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). The average onset occurred 17.24\u00a0days after initiation, on an average dose of 151.28\u00a0mg/day. Titration was either paused or slowed in most of these patients, with no reported fatalities. The types of pneumonia included aspiration pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia. Myocarditis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, and urinary tract infections were also identified. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a greater number of concomitant antipsychotics (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.59, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and concomitant benzodiazepine use (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.33, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. Overall, pneumonia development during clozapine titration is linked with other inflammatory ADRs, suggesting a shared immunological mechanism.

The concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio must be taken into account, which may vary among ethnicities. In this retrospective study, 1408 Korean schizophrenia inpatients were examined for during the first 8\u00a0weeks of clozapine titration. The average doses of clozapine administered during weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 were 77.37, 137.73, 193.20, and 212.83\u00a0mg/day, with significantly lower doses for females than males. The average C/D ratio was significantly higher in females (1.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04 and 1.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67\u00a0ng/mL per mg/day). Patients with higher C/D ratios were more likely to experience fever and were prescribed lower doses of clozapine starting from week 4. In total, 22.1\u00a0% of patients developed a fever at an average of 15.74\u00a0days after initiating clozapine. Patients who developed a fever were younger, used more antipsychotics at baseline, had a higher C/D ratio, and had a higher incidence of an elevated C-reactive protein level. A higher C/D ratio, use of a greater number of antipsychotics at baseline, and concomitant olanzapine use were risk factors for the development of inflammatory reactions. The incidence of pneumonia, agranulocytosis, and myocarditis within 8\u00a0weeks were 3.7\u00a0%, 0.3\u00a0%, and 0.1\u00a0%. In summary, the target dose of clozapine titration is lower for Korean schizophrenia patients, with a higher C/D ratio and more frequent fever compared to Western patients; however, myocarditis occurs rarely.

However, the role of the thalamus and cerebellum when integrated into intrinsic networks and how those integrated networks interact in schizophrenia patients are largely unknown. We generated an integrative network map by merging thalamic and cerebellar network maps, which were parcellated using a winner-take-all approach, onto a cortical network map. Using cognitive networks, the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the salience network (SAL), and the central executive network (CEN) as regions of interest, the FC of 48 schizophrenia patients was compared with that of 57 healthy controls (HCs). The association between abnormal FC and cognitive impairment was also investigated in patients. FC was lower between the SAL-CEN, SAL-DMN, and DMN-CEN and within-CEN in schizophrenia patients than in HCs. Hypoconnectivity between the DMN-CEN was correlated with impaired cognition in schizophrenia patients.

Therefore, the detection of CNV is essential for establishing an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Current ophthalmic imaging techniques, such as fundus fluorescent angiography and optical coherence tomography, have limitations in accurately visualizing CNV lesions and expressing CNV activity, owing to issues such as excessive dye leakage with pooling and the inability to provide functional information. Here, using the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide's affinity for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, which is expressed in the neovascular endothelial cells in ocular tissues, we propose the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RGD peptide as a novel dye for effective molecular imaging of CNV. FITC-labeled RGD peptides (FITC-RGD2), prepared by bioconjugation of one FITC molecule with two RGD peptides, demonstrated better visualization and precise localization of CNV lesions than conventional fluorescein dyes in laser-induced CNV rodent models, as assessed using various imaging techniques, including a commercially available clinical fundus camera (Optos). These results suggest that FITC-RGD2 can serve as an effective novel dye for the diagnosis of neovascular retinal diseases, including AMD, by enabling early detection and treatment of disease occurrence and recurrence after treatment.", "Keywords": ["RGD peptides", "age-related macular degeneration", "choroidal neovascularization", "contrast agents", "fundus fluorescent angiography"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Contrast Media", "Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate", "Fluorescein", "Endothelial Cells", "Choroidal Neovascularization", "Oligopeptides", "Coloring Agents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seung Woo", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hye Kyoung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jehwi", "Last Name": "Jeon", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Ji Young", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Pilhan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Byung Chul", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Se Joon", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2023Jul21"}, {"PMID": "37500824", "Title": "Magnetic resonance texture analysis reveals stagewise nonlinear alterations of the frontal gray matter in patients with early psychosis.", "Abstract": "Although gray matter (GM) abnormalities are present from the early stages of psychosis, subtle/miniscule changes may not be detected by conventional volumetry. Texture analysis (TA), which permits quantification of the complex interrelationship between contrasts at the individual voxel level, may capture subtle GM changes with more sensitivity than does volume or cortical thickness (CTh). We performed three-dimensional TA in nine GM regions of interest (ROIs) using T1 magnetic resonance images from 101 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 85 patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, and 147 controls. Via principal component analysis, three features of gray-level cooccurrence matrix - informational measure of correlation 1 (IMC1), autocorrelation (AC), and inverse difference (ID) - were selected to analyze cortical texture in the ROIs that showed a significant change in volume or CTh in the study groups. Significant reductions in GM volume and CTh of various frontotemporal regions were found in the FEP compared with the controls. Increased frontal AC was found in the FEP group compared to the controls after adjusting for volume and CTh changes. While volume and CTh were preserved in the CHR group, a stagewise nonlinear increase in frontal IMC1 was found, which exceeded both the controls and FEP group. Increased frontal IMC1 was also associated with a lesser severity of attenuated positive symptoms in the CHR group, while neither volume nor CTh was. The results of the current study suggest that frontal IMC1 may reflect subtle, dynamic GM changes and the symptomatology of the CHR stage with greater sensitivity, even in the absence of gross GM abnormalities. Some structural mechanisms that may contribute to texture changes (e.g., macrostructural cortical lamina, neuropil/myelination, cortical reorganization) and their possible implications are explored and discussed.

Our single-cell analysis reveals that only a small subset of melanoma cells exhibits effective RTK and ERK activation and develops persisters, despite uniform external stimuli. The kinetics of RTK activation directly influence ERK signaling dynamics and persister development. These initially rare persisters form major resistant clones through effective RTK-mediated ERK activation. Consequently, limiting RTK signaling suppresses ERK activation and cell proliferation in drug-resistant cells.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether NMDAR regulates the megakaryocytic cell clock and whether the megakaryocytic clock regulates cell proliferation and cell death. We found that both the Meg-01 megakaryocytic cell line and native murine megakaryocytes expressed circadian clock genes. Megakaryocyte-directed deletion of Grin1 in mice caused significant disruption of the circadian rhythm pathway at the transcriptional level and increased expression of BMAL1 at the protein level. Similarly, both pharmacological (MK-801) and genetic (GRIN-/-) inhibition of NMDAR in Meg-01 cells in vitro resulted in widespread changes in clock gene expression including increased expression of BMAL1, the core clock transcription factor. BMAL1 overexpression reduced Meg-01 cell proliferation and altered the time-dependent expression of the cell cycle regulators MYC and WEE1, whereas BMAL1 knockdown led to increased cell death in Meg-01-GRIN1-/- cells.

Moreover, the majority of studies have focused only on predefined regions or functional networks rather than connectivity throughout the entire brain. Here, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity between OCD patients and healthy controls (HC) using mega-analysis of data from 1024 OCD patients and 1028 HC from 28 independent samples of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed group differences in whole-brain functional connectivity at both the regional and network level, and investigated whether functional connectivity could serve as biomarker to identify patient status at the individual level using machine learning analysis. The mega-analyses revealed widespread abnormalities in functional connectivity in OCD, with global hypo-connectivity (Cohen's d: -0.27 to -0.13) and few hyper-connections, mainly with the thalamus (Cohen's d: 0.19 to 0.22). Most hypo-connections were located within the sensorimotor network and no fronto-striatal abnormalities were found. Overall, classification performances were poor, with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) scores ranging between 0.567 and 0.673, with better classification for medicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.702) than unmedicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.608) patients versus healthy controls.

microenvironment determines the probability of target encounter and tumor killing. CD8+ T-cell exclusion from the tumor parenchyma is associated with poor response to immunotherapy, and yet the biology that underpins this distinct pattern remains unclear. Here we show that the vascular destabilizing factor angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) causes compromised vascular integrity in the tumor periphery, leading to impaired T-cell infiltration to the tumor core. The spatial regulation of ANGPT2 in whole tumor cross-sections was analyzed in conjunction with T-cell distribution, vascular integrity, and response to immunotherapy in syngeneic murine melanoma models. T-cell exclusion was associated with ANGPT2 upregulation and elevated vascular leakage at the periphery of human and murine melanomas. Both pharmacologic and genetic blockade of ANGPT2 promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor core, exerting antitumor effects. Importantly, the reversal of T-cell exclusion following ANGPT2 blockade not only enhanced response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in immunogenic, therapy-responsive mouse melanomas, but it also rendered nonresponsive tumors susceptible to immunotherapy. Therapeutic response after ANGPT2 blockade, driven by improved CD8+ T-cell infiltration to the tumor core, coincided with spatial TIE2 signaling activation and increased vascular integrity at the tumor periphery where endothelial expression of adhesion molecules was reduced. These data highlight ANGPT2/TIE2 signaling as a key mediator of T-cell exclusion and a promising target to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in melanoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Angiopoietin-2", "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors", "Melanoma", "Immunotherapy", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ha-Ram", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anahita", "Last Name": "Shiva", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Portia", "Last Name": "Cummings", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Seoyeon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "School of Biosystems and Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Science, Korea University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eunhyeong", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Subrata", "Last Name": "Chowdhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "Shawber", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Carvajal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gavin", "Last Name": "Thurston", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joon-Yong", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "School of Biosystems and Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Science, Korea University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Amanda W", "Last Name": "Lund", "Affiliation": "Ronald O.

We carried out the largest case-control study of structural brain asymmetries in schizophrenia, with MRI data from 5,080 affected individuals and 6,015 controls across 46 datasets, using a single image analysis protocol. Asymmetry indexes were calculated for global and regional cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume measures. Differences of asymmetry were calculated between affected individuals and controls per dataset, and effect sizes were meta-analyzed across datasets. Small average case-control differences were observed for thickness asymmetries of the rostral anterior cingulate and the middle temporal gyrus, both driven by thinner left-hemispheric cortices in schizophrenia. Analyses of these asymmetries with respect to the use of antipsychotic medication and other clinical variables did not show any significant associations. Assessment of age- and sex-specific effects revealed a stronger average leftward asymmetry of pallidum volume between older cases and controls. Case-control differences in a multivariate context were assessed in a subset of the data (N = 2,029), which revealed that 7% of the variance across all structural asymmetries was explained by case-control status. Subtle case-control differences of brain macrostructural asymmetry may reflect differences at the molecular, cytoarchitectonic, or circuit levels that have functional relevance for the disorder. Reduced left middle temporal cortical thickness is consistent with altered left-hemisphere language network organization in schizophrenia.", "Keywords": ["Schizophrenia", "asymmetry", "brain imaging",

socio-emotional development.", "Abstract": "Functional connectivity between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been identified as a neural substrate of emotion regulation that undergoes changes throughout development, with a mature profile typically emerging at 10 years of age. Maternal bonding in childhood has been shown to buffer amygdala reactivity and to influence the trajectory of amygdala-mPFC coupling. The oxytocinergic system is critical in the development of social behavior and maternal bonding. Early-life parental care influences the methylation status of the oxytocin receptor (OXTRm) in animal models and humans, and higher OXTRm is associated with lower amygdala-PFC functional connectivity in adults. Using a neuroimaging-epigenetic approach, we investigated saliva-derived OXTRm as a biological marker of structural and functional connectivity maturation in 57 typically developing children (P\u2009<\u20090.05). We utilized seed-based connectivity analysis during a novel abstract movie paradigm and find that higher levels of OXTRm are associated with a more adult-like functional connectivity profile. Concurrently, more adult-like functional connectivity was associated with higher reported self-control and more diffusion streamlines between the amygdala and mPFC. OXTRm mediates the association between structural and functional connectivity with higher levels of OXTRm being associated with more streamlines. Lastly, we also find that lower OXTRm blunts the association between amygdala-mPFC connectivity and future internalizing behaviors in early adolescence. These findings implicate OXTRm as a biological marker at the interface of the social environment and amygdala-mPFC connectivity in emotional and behavioral regulation. Ultimately, identification of neurobiological markers may lead to earlier detection of children at risk for socio-emotional dysfunction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Child", "Adolescent", "Animals", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Amygdala", "Emotions", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Receptors, Oxytocin", "Neural Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amalia M", "Last Name": "Skyberg", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia, Department of Psychology, 102 Gilmer Hall, P.O.

Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether plasma proteomics-based clustering could subtype patients with transdiagnostic psychotic-affective disorder diagnoses. The study population included 504 patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder and 160 healthy controls, aged 19 to 65 years. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed using plasma samples from each individual. Pathologic peptides were determined by linear regression between patients and healthy controls. Latent class analysis was conducted in patients after peptide values were stratified by sex and divided into tertile values. Significant demographic and clinical characteristics were determined for the latent clusters. The latent class analysis was repeated when healthy controls were included. Twelve peptides were significantly different between the patients and healthy controls after controlling for significant covariates. Latent class analysis based on these peptides after stratification by sex revealed two distinct classes of patients. The negative symptom factor of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was significantly different between the classes (t\u2009=\u2009-2.070, p\u2009=\u20090.039). When healthy controls were included, two latent classes were identified, and the negative symptom factor of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was still significant (t\u2009=\u2009-2.372, p\u2009=\u20090.018).

We investigated evidence for advanced brain ageing in adult SZ patients, and whether this was associated with clinical characteristics in a prospective meta-analytic study conducted by the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. The study included data from 26 cohorts worldwide, with a total of 2803 SZ patients (mean age 34.2 years; range 18-72 years; 67% male) and 2598 healthy controls (mean age 33.8 years, range 18-73 years, 55% male). Brain-predicted age was individually estimated using a model trained on independent data based on 68 measures of cortical thickness and surface area, 7 subcortical volumes, lateral ventricular volumes and total intracranial volume, all derived from T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Deviations from a healthy brain ageing trajectory were assessed by the difference between brain-predicted age and chronological age (brain-predicted age difference [brain-PAD]). On average, SZ patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +3.55 years (95% CI: 2.91, 4.19; I2\u2009=\u200957.53%) compared to controls, after adjusting for age, sex and site (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.48). Among SZ patients, brain-PAD was not associated with specific clinical characteristics (age of onset, duration of illness, symptom severity, or antipsychotic use and dose). This large-scale collaborative study suggests advanced structural brain ageing in SZ. Longitudinal studies of SZ and a range of mental and somatic health outcomes will help to further evaluate the clinical implications of increased brain-PAD and its ability to be influenced by interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Male", "Adolescent", "Young Adult", "Middle Aged", "Aged", "Female", "Prospective Studies", "Schizophrenia", "Magnetic Resonance

However, the selective formation of desired products only via CO2RR has been elusive due to the presence of a myriad of competing reaction pathways, thus calling for effective strategies controlling the reaction coordinates. The control of binding energies of the reaction intermediate, such as *CO, is pivotal to manipulating reaction pathways, and various attempts have been made to accomplish this goal. Herein, we introduce recent endeavors to increase the catalytic selectivity of Cu-based catalysts by surface modification with polymer coating, which can change the local pH, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, reaction concentration, etc. The polymer conjugation also contributed to the enhanced electrocatalytic stability of Cu-based catalysts during the CO2RR. We also point to the remaining challenges and provide perspectives on the further development of Cu-polymer hybrid catalysts for the practical CO2RR.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minki", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Doyeop", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minsu", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Taehyun", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute of Basic Sciences, Incheon National University, 119 Academy-ro, Incheon 22012, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kwangyeol", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Research Institute for Natural Sciences, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "ACS omega", "PubDate": "2022Nov29"}, {"PMID": "36453986", "Title": "Large-Scale Thalamocortical Triple Network Dysconnectivities in Patients With First-Episode Psychosis and Individuals at Risk for Psychosis.", "Abstract": "Aberrant thalamocortical connectivity and large-scale network interactions among the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) (ie, triple networks) have been regarded as critical in schizophrenia pathophysiology.

Emerging reports suggest deficits in this system across multiple psychiatric disorders, making it a unique network of high translational and transdiagnostic utility in mapping neural alterations that potentially contribute to symptoms and disturbances in psychiatric patients. However, despite considerable research effort, it is still debated how this system contributes to psychiatric disorders. This review characterizes current knowledge regarding thalamic connectivity system deficits in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, across multiple levels of the system. We identify the presence of common and distinct patterns of deficits in the thalamic connectivity system in major psychiatric disorders and assess their nature and characteristics. Specifically, this review assembles evidence for the hypotheses of 1) thalamic microstructure, particularly in the mediodorsal nucleus, as a state marker of psychosis; 2) thalamo-prefrontal connectivity as a trait marker of psychosis; and 3) thalamo-somatosensory/parietal connectivity as a possible marker of general psychiatric illness. Furthermore, possible mechanisms contributing to thalamocortical dysconnectivity are explored. We discuss current views on the contributions of cerebellar-thalamic connectivity to the thalamic connectivity system and propose future studies to examine its effects at multiple levels, from the molecular (e.g., glutamatergic) to the behavioral (e.g., cognition), to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the disturbances observed in psychiatric disorders.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Psychiatry", "Psychosis", "Thalamic connectivity system", "Thalamocortical", "Thalamus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wu Jeong", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yoo Bin", "Last Name": "Kwak", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kang Ik K", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Tae Young", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Harin", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minji", "Last Name": "Ha", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jun Soo", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "Biological psychiatry global open science", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "36259417", "Title": "Cortical gyrification differences between early- and late-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder: neurobiological evidence for neurodevelopmentally distinct subtypes.", "Abstract": "Identifying more homogenous subtypes of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using biological evidence is critical for understanding complexities of the disorder in this heterogeneous population.

This process is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Here, using live-cell sensors for CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities, we propose that CDK4/6 initiates Rb inactivation and CDK2 activation, which coordinates the timing of cell-cycle commitment and sequential G1/S transition. Our data show that CDK4/6 activation induces Rb inactivation and thereby E2F activation, driving a gradual increase in CDK2 activity. We found that rapid CDK4/6 inhibition can reverse cell-cycle entry until CDK2 activity reaches to high levels. This suggests that high CDK2 activity is required to initiate CDK2-Rb positive feedback and CDK4/6-indpendent cell-cycle progression. Since CDK2 activation also facilitates initiation of DNA replication, the timing of CDK2-Rb positive feedback is coupled with the G1/S transition. Our experiments, which acutely increased CDK2 activity by cyclin E1 overexpression, indicate that cells commit to the cell cycle before triggering DNA replication. Together, our data suggest that CDK4/6 inactivates Rb to begin E2F and CDK2 activation, and high CDK2 activity is necessary and sufficient to generate a bistable switch for Rb phosphorylation before DNA replication.

However, the extent of neuroanatomical heterogeneity in the CHR-P state is largely undetermined. We aimed to quantify the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in structural magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical surface area (SA), cortical thickness (CT), subcortical volume (SV), and intracranial volume (ICV) in CHR-P individuals compared with healthy controls (HC), and in relation to subsequent transition to a first episode of psychosis. The ENIGMA CHR-P consortium applied a harmonised analysis to neuroimaging data across 29 international sites, including 1579 CHR-P individuals and 1243 HC, offering the largest pooled CHR-P neuroimaging dataset to date. Regional heterogeneity was indexed with the Variability Ratio (VR) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) ratio applied at the group level. Personalised estimates of heterogeneity of SA, CT and SV brain profiles were indexed with the novel Person-Based Similarity Index (PBSI), with two complementary applications. First, to assess the extent of within-diagnosis similarity or divergence of neuroanatomical profiles between individuals. Second, using a normative modelling approach, to assess the 'normativeness' of neuroanatomical profiles in individuals at CHR-P. CHR-P individuals demonstrated no greater regional heterogeneity after applying FDR corrections. However, PBSI scores indicated significantly greater neuroanatomical divergence in global SA, CT and SV profiles in CHR-P individuals compared with HC. Normative PBSI analysis identified 11 CHR-P individuals (0.70%) with marked deviation (>1.5\u2009SD) in SA, 118 (7.47%) in CT and 161 (10.20%) in SV. Psychosis transition was not significantly associated with any measure of heterogeneity. Overall, our examination of neuroanatomical heterogeneity within the CHR-P state indicated greater divergence in neuroanatomical profiles at an individual level, irrespective of psychosis conversion. Further large-scale investigations are required of those who demonstrate marked deviation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Psychotic Disorders"],

However, few studies investigated relevance of the schizophrenia genetic liability and the use of genetic reprogramming on pluripotent stem cells to the impaired neurodevelopment shown by stem cells. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the cellular phenotypes of induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) derived without genetic modification from patients with schizophrenia and from genetic high risk (GHR) individuals. Three patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 3 GHR individuals who had two or more relatives with schizophrenia, and 3 healthy volunteers participated. iNSCs were derived using a small molecule-based lineage switch method, and their gene expression levels and migration capabilities were examined. Demographic characteristics were not different among the groups (age, \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a05.637, P\u00a0=\u00a0.060; education, \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a02.111, P\u00a0=\u00a0.348). All participants stayed well during the follow-up except one GHR individual who developed psychosis 1.5\u00a0years later. Migration capacity was impaired in iNSCs from patients with schizophrenia (SZ-iNSCs) compared to iNSCs from GHR individuals or controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). iNSCs from a GHR individual who later developed schizophrenia showed migratory impairment that was similar to SZ-iNSCs. Gene expression levels of Sox2 in SZ-iNSCs were significantly lower than those in controls (P\u00a0=\u00a0.028). Defective migration in genetically unmodified SZ-iNSCs is the first direct demonstration of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia. Additionally, alterations in gene expression in SZ-iNSCs suggest mechanisms by which genetic liability leads to aberrant neurodevelopment.", "Keywords": ["Genetic high risk", "Neurodevelopment", "Neuronal migration", "Schizophrenia", "Stem cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Neural Stem Cells", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junhee", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Behavioral Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry, Uijeongbu Eulji Medical Center, 11759 Uijeongbu, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sehyeon", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell & Neurobiology, Department of Oral Anatomy, Dental Research Institute and School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, 08826 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Juhee", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell & Neurobiology, Department of Oral Anatomy, Dental Research Institute and School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jisoo", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell & Neurobiology, Department of Oral Anatomy, Dental Research Institute and School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eun Kyung", "Last Name": "Choe", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, 06236 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae Young", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, 50612 Yangsan, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Myong-Wuk", "Last Name": "Chon", "Affiliation": "National Center for Mental Health, 04933 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seong Who", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 05505 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Myung-Suk", "Last Name": "Chun", "Affiliation": "National Agenda Research Division, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, 02792 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Mi-Sook", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell & Neurobiology, Department of Oral Anatomy, Dental Research Institute and School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, 08826 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Neuroscience Research Institute, Seoul National University, 03080 Seoul, Republic of Korea.

The striatum is subdivided by cortical connections and functions; however, the anatomical aberrations in different cortico-striatal connections and coexisting microstructural anomalies in striatal subregions of OCD patients are poorly understood. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the aberrations in cortico-striatal white matter (WM) connectivity and the associated subregional microstructure of the striatum in patients with OCD. From diffusion tensor/kurtosis imaging of 107 unmedicated OCD patients and 110 matched healthy controls (HCs), we calculated the cortico-striatal WM connectivity and segmented the striatum using probabilistic tractography. For the segmented striatal subregions, we measured average diffusion kurtosis values, which represent microstructural complexity. Connectivity and mean kurtosis values in each cortical target and associated striatal subregions were compared between groups. We identified significantly reduced orbitofrontal WM connectivity with its associated striatal subregion in patients with OCD compared to that in HCs. However, OCD patients exhibited significantly increased caudal-motor and parietal connectivity with the associated striatal subregions. The mean kurtosis values of the striatal subregions connected to the caudal-motor and parietal cortex were significantly decreased in OCD patients. Our results highlighted contrasting patterns of striatal WM connections with the orbitofrontal and caudal-motor/parietal cortices, thus supporting the cortico-striatal circuitry imbalance model of OCD. We suggest that aberrations in WM connections and the microstructure of their downstream regions in the caudal-motor-/parietal-striatal circuits may underlie OCD pathophysiology and further provide potential neuromodulation targets for the treatment of OCD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "White Matter", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Corpus Striatum", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Brain Mapping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hyungyou", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yoo Bin", "Last Name": "Kwak", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kang Ik K", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junhee", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Behavioral Medicine, SNU-MRC, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sun-Young", "Last Name": "Moon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Silvia Kyungjin", "Last Name": "Lho", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jun Soo", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2022Aug"}, {"PMID": "35484084", "Title": "Unbalanced fronto-pallidal neurocircuit underlying set shifting in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Maladaptive habitual behaviours of obsessive-compulsive disorder are characterized by cognitive inflexibility, which hypothetically arises from dysfunctions of a certain cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit including the ventrolateral prefrontal region. Inside this neurocircuit, an imbalance between distinct striatal projections to basal ganglia output nuclei, either directly or indirectly via the external globus pallidus, is suggested to be relevant for impaired arbitration between facilitation and inhibition of cortically initiated activity. However, current evidence of individually altered cortico-striatal or thalamo-cortical connectivities is insufficient to understand how cortical dysconnections are linked to the imbalanced basal ganglia system in patients. In this study, we aimed to identify aberrant ventrolateral prefronto-basal ganglia-thalamic subnetworks representing direct-indirect imbalance and its association with cognitive inflexibility in patients. To increase network detection sensitivity, we constructed a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network model incorporating striatal, pallidal and thalamic subregions defined by unsupervised clustering in 105 medication-free patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (age\u2009=\u200925.05\u2009\u00b1\u20096.55 years, male/female\u2009=\u200970/35) and 99 healthy controls (age\u2009=\u200923.93\u2009\u00b1\u20095.80 years, male/female\u2009=\u200964/35). By using the network-based statistic method, we analysed group differences in subnetworks formed by suprathreshold dysconnectivities. Using linear regression models, we tested subnetwork dysconnectivity effects on symptom severity and set-shifting performance assessed by well-validated clinical and cognitive tests. Compared with the healthy controls, patients were slower to track the Part B sequence of the Trail Making Test when the effects of psychomotor and visuospatial functions were adjusted (t\u2009=\u20093.89, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and made more extradimensional shift errors (t\u2009=\u20094.09, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition to reduced fronto-striatal and striato-external pallidal connectivities and hypoconnected striato-thalamic subnetwork [P\u2009=\u20090.001, family-wise error rate (FWER) corrected], patients had hyperconnected fronto-external pallidal (P\u2009=\u20090.012, FWER corrected) and intra-thalamic (P\u2009=\u20090.015, FWER corrected) subnetworks compared with the healthy controls. Among the patients, the fronto-pallidal subnetwork alteration, especially ventrolateral prefronto-external globus pallidal hyperconnectivity, was associated with relatively fewer extradimensional shifting errors (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.30, P\u2009=\u20090.001). Our findings suggest that the hyperconnected fronto-external pallidal subnetwork may have an opposite effect to the imbalance caused by the reduced indirect pathway (fronto-striato-external pallidal) connectivities in patients. This ventrolateral prefrontal hyperconnectivity may help the external globus pallidus disinhibit basal ganglia output nuclei, which results in behavioural inhibition, so as to compensate for the impaired set shifting.

The recent pandemic has contributed to this problem. Obesity refers to a state in which lipid accumulates excessively in adipocytes and adipose tissues. Dried heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis (EF-2001) prevents allergic mechanisms, inflammation, and tumor progression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EF-2001 on high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. The degree of obesity in experimental rats was reduced after 6 weeks of oral administration of 3 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg dosages of EF-2001, indicating regulating effects in rats with HFD-induced obesity. We found that EF-2001 decreased the amounts of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) in HFD-induced obese rats. The effects of EF-2001 on 3T3-L1 adipocytes stained with Oil red O stain are shown in reductions of lipid accumulation, respectively. In addition, we examined the relationships between EF-2001 treatment and mechanisms for the insulin signaling of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.

We compared the expression of their plasma proteins with that of 48 BD-II and 75 healthy control (HC) to identify markers that could be detected in a high-risk state. The multiple reaction monitoring method was used to measure target peptide levels with high accuracy. A total of 26 significant peptides were identified through analysis of variance with multiple comparisons, of which 19 were differentially expressed in the BP group when compared to the BD-II and HC groups. Two proteins were overexpressed in the BP group; and were related to pro-inflammation and impaired neurotransmission. The other under-expressed peptides in the BP group were related to blood coagulation, immune reactions, lipid metabolism, and the synaptic plasticity. In this study, significant markers observed in the BP group have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders.

Particular thalamic subregions may drive these differences. The ENIGMA-OCD working group conducted mega- and meta-analyses to study thalamic subregional volume in OCD across the lifespan. Structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 2649 OCD patients and 2774 healthy controls across 29 sites (50 datasets) were processed using the FreeSurfer built-in ThalamicNuclei pipeline to extract five thalamic subregions. Volume measures were harmonized for site effects using ComBat before running separate multiple linear regression models for children, adolescents, and adults to estimate volumetric group differences. All analyses were pre-registered ( https://osf.io/73dvy ) and adjusted for age, sex and intracranial volume. Unmedicated pediatric OCD patients (<12 years) had larger lateral (d\u2009=\u20090.46), pulvinar (d\u2009=\u20090.33), ventral (d\u2009=\u20090.35) and whole thalamus (d\u2009=\u20090.40) volumes at unadjusted p-values <0.05. Adolescent patients showed no volumetric differences. Adult OCD patients compared with controls had smaller volumes across all subregions (anterior, lateral, pulvinar, medial, and ventral) and smaller whole thalamic volume (d\u2009=\u2009-0.15 to -0.07) after multiple comparisons correction, mostly driven by medicated patients and associated with symptom severity. The anterior thalamus was also significantly smaller in patients after adjusting for thalamus size. Our results suggest that OCD-related thalamic volume differences are global and not driven by particular subregions and that the direction of effects are driven by both age and medication status.",

blockade.", "Abstract": "This study determined the influence of intravenous (i.v.) oncolytic vaccinia virus mpJX-594 (mpJX) on antitumor activity of anti-programmed death receptor-1 antibody (aPD1) in functional and metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). One i.v. dose of mpJX, engineered for mice with the same plasmid design as clinical virus Pexa-Vec, was administered alone or with repeated dosing of aPD1 (mpJX+aPD1) to two contrasting genetic models of PanNET: one developing benign insulin-secreting tumors (RIP1-Tag2;C57BL/6J mice) and the other developing liver metastases (RIP1-Tag2;AB6F1 mice). Experiments revealed that aPD1 had synergistic actions with mpJX on CD8+ T\u00a0cell and natural killer (NK) cell influx, apoptosis, and suppression of proliferation in PanNETs. After mpJX+aPD1, the 53-fold increase in apoptosis (5\u00a0days) and 85% reduction in proliferation (20\u00a0days) exceeded the sum of mpJX and aPD1 given separately. mpJX+aPD1 also stabilized blood insulin and glucose in mice with functional PanNETs, regressed liver metastases in mice with aggressive PanNETs, and prolonged survival of both. The findings revealed that mpJX+aPD1 converted \"cold\" PanNETs into immunogenic tumors with widespread cytotoxic T\u00a0cell influx, tumor cell killing, and suppression of proliferation. Reduction of tumor insulin secretion from functional PanNETs prolonged survival, and anti-metastatic actions on aggressive PanNETs reduced the metastatic burden to less than before treatment. The findings support the efficacy of the vaccinia virus with aPD1 for functional and metastatic PanNETs.", "Keywords": ["A/J mice", "NK cells", "PD-1", "Pexa-Vec", "RIP1-Tag2 mice", "apoptosis", "cytotoxic T\u00a0cells", "hypoglycemia", "insulin", "liver metastasis", "regression"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mitsuko", "Last Name": "Inoue", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomoyoshi", "Last Name": "Inoue", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Madeline", "Last Name": "Tait", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Byrne", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Nitschk\u00e9", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrizia", "Last Name": "Murer", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Cha", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aishwarya", "Last Name": "Subramanian", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "De Silva", "Affiliation": "SillaJen Biotherapeutics Inc., San Francisco, CA 94111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Chiaverotti", "Affiliation": "SillaJen Biotherapeutics Inc., San Francisco, CA 94111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald M", "Last Name": "McDonald", "Affiliation": "UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, Room S1349, San Francisco, CA 94143-0452, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular therapy oncolytics", "PubDate": "2022Mar17"}, {"PMID": "34999371", "Title": "Volume deficits in hippocampal subfields in unaffected relatives of schizophrenia patients with high genetic loading but without any psychiatric symptoms.", "Abstract": "Hippocampal volume changes have been reported in schizophrenia patients and their relatives and are proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

A 49-year-old female patient on chronic lithium therapy due to bipolar disorder was transferred to the emergency department with signs of dehydration, altered mental status, and increased oxygen demand. She was admitted to a local psychiatric clinic first because of an exacerbation of a manic episode. When she was transferred to our clinic, her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, she was tachycardic (110 beats/min), had tachypnea (24 breaths/min), normal body temperature (36.5 \u2103), and an oxygen saturation of 94% via a face mask (10 L/min). Laboratory results showed hypertonic hypernatremia (osmolality, 363 mOsm/kg; sodium, 171 mEq/L), low urine osmolality (osmolality, 231 mOsm/kg), and normal urine sodium (Na, 63 mEq/L). Her serum lithium concentration was above the therapeutic range (1.52 mmol/L). An increase in cardiac markers and changes in electrocardiogram were detected; therefore, echocardiography was performed, which showed right ventricular dysfunction and small left ventricular chamber size. Computed tomography of the chest and lower extremities showed pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). She was treated with hypotonic fluid to correct hypernatremia and intravenous heparin for thromboembolism. The size of the thromboembolism decreased, and hypernatremia was corrected. She was discharged with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).

Here, we show that CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 3 (CRTC3) quantitatively regulates and orchestrates melanogenesis by directly targeting microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and regulating the expression of most key melanogenesis-related genes. Methods: We analyzed CRTC3-null, KRT14-SCF transgenic, and their crossover mice. The molecular basis of CRTC3 effects on pigmentation was investigated by histology, melanin/tyrosinase assay, immunoblotting, shRNA, promoter assay, qRT-PCR, and subcellular localization. These analyses were carried out in primary cultured melanocytes, mouse cell lines, normal human cells, co-cultures, and ex vivo human skin. CRTC/CREB activity screening was performed to identify candidate agents for the regulation of melanogenesis. Results: The coat and skin color of CRTC3-null mice was paler due to a reduction in melanin deposition. Melanogenesis-related genes were reduced in CRTC3-deficient cultured melanocytes and tail skin of CRTC3-null mice. Notably, basal levels of MITF present in CRTC3-null mice were sufficient for melanocytic differentiation/survival. Thus CRTC3-null mice showed a comparable number of epidermal melanocytes compared to control mice. Stem cell factor (SCF) introduction by crossing with KRT14-SCF mice increased epidermal melanocytes and melanin deposition in control and CRTC3-null mice, but the skin color remained still light on the CRTC3-null background. Furthermore, we identified the therapeutic potential of altiratinib to inhibit melanogenesis in human melanocytes and human skin effectively and safely. Conclusion: CRTC3 appears to be a key sensor for melanogenesis and can be used as a reversible and tunable tool for selectively regulating melanogenesis without affecting melanocyte integrity. Thus, CRTC3 can also serve as a screening tool for the discovery of ideal melanogenesis-modulating small molecules.", "Keywords": ["CRTC3/CREB", "MITF", "cAMP- or UV-stimulated melanogenesis", "melanocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Epidermis", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Keratin-14", "Male", "Melanins", "Melanocytes", "Melanoma", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor", "Phosphorylation", "Primary Cell Culture", "Skin", "Skin Pigmentation", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hanju", "Last Name": "Yoo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Ha-Ri", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Ki-Hyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Min-Ah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seunghyun", "Last Name": "Bang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Young-Ho", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Woo-Hyung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Youngsup", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sung Eun", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea."}], "Journal": "Theranostics", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34718814", "Title": "Sex differences in the behavioral inhibition system and ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity.", "Abstract": "The reinforcement sensitivity theory proposes brain-behavioral systems that underlie individual differences in sensitivity to punishment and reward.

To better treat OCD, the development of biomarkers to bridge the gap between the symptomatic-cognitive phenotype and brain abnormalities is warranted. Therefore, we aimed to identify biomarkers of impaired organizational strategies during visual encoding processes in OCD patients by developing an eye tracking-based Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT). In 104 OCD patients and 114 healthy controls (HCs), eye movements were recorded during memorization of the RCFT figure, and organizational scores were evaluated. Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) scores were calculated to evaluate the distance between a participant's eye gaze distribution and a hypothetical uniform distribution within the RCFT figure. Narrower gaze distributions within the RCFT figure, which yielded higher KLD scores, indicated that the participant was more obsessed with detail and had less organizational strategy. The OCD patients showed lower organizational scores than the HCs. Although no group differences in KLD scores were noted, KLD scores were significantly associated with organization T scores in the OCD group. The current study findings suggest that eye tracking biomarkers of visual memory encoding provide a rapidly determined index of executive functioning, such as organizational strategies, in OCD patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Executive Function", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Symptom Assessment", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Woncheol", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tak Hyung", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Healthcare Sensor Laboratory, Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Taekwan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Wu Jeong", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jun Soo", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Sep15"}, {"PMID": "36315242", "Title": "Forecasting prognostic trajectories with mismatch negativity in early psychosis.", "Abstract": "Prognostic heterogeneity in early psychosis patients yields significant difficulties in determining the degree and duration of early intervention; this heterogeneity highlights the need for prognostic biomarkers.

Previous studies have reported that these diseases share common pathophysiological pathways; therefore, this study elucidated whether the plasma levels of protein markers related to common depressive symptoms differed between patients with BD and those with MDD. Plasma samples of 71 patients with mood disorders and clinical manifestations were analyzed in this study. After depleting the abundant proteins, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and label-free quantification were performed. Five proteins, viz., cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein D (APOD), mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP2), Ig lambda chain V-II region BO (IGLV2-8) and Ig kappa chain V-III region NG9 (IGKV3-20) were negatively associated with the total scores of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D), after adjusting for the covariates. CETP and APOD also showed significant negative correlations with the anhedonia/retardation and guilt/agitation scores of the HAM-D. Four proteins, namely, Ig kappa chain V-II region TEW (IGKC; IGKV2D-28), Ig lambda variable 5-45 (IGLV5-45), complement factor H (CFH) and attractin (ATRN), showed significant associations with anhedonia/retardation after adjusting for covariates. Proteins that significantly correlated with the symptoms could predict the remission state of depression (area under the curve [AUC], 0.83) and anhedonia/retardation (AUC, 0.80). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that complement activation, immune response, and lipid metabolism were significantly enriched pathways.

Silymarin, a liver-protective agent, was used as a positive control. In cell experiments, after 24\u2009h of treatment with the extract, no cytotoxicity was noted, and death by alcohol was avoided. Migration of Chang liver cells increased after exposure to the extract at a concentration of 400\u2009\u03bcg/mL. In animal experiments, alcohol was injected into 6-week-old rats for 1, 3, and 50 days. Oral administration of the drug was performed 30\u2009min before alcohol administration. The control was treated with distilled water, and the drug groups were administered EtOH (40% EtOH\u2009+\u20092.5\u2009mL/kg), EtOH\u2009+\u2009Cii L (low concentration, 2\u2009mg/kg), EtOH\u2009+\u2009Cii H (high concentration, 10\u2009mg/kg), or EtOH\u2009+\u2009silymarin (100\u2009mg/kg). Increased liver weight was observed in the alcohol group, as were increased blood-alcohol concentration and liver damage indicators (glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and triglycerides (TG)), decreased alcoholysis enzymes (ADH and ALDH), and increased CYP2E1. In the Cii treatment group, liver weight, blood-alcohol concentration, liver damage indicators (GOT, GPT, and TG), and CYP2E1 were decreased, while alcoholysis enzymes (ADH and ALDH) were increased. The degree of histopathological liver damage was compared visually and by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O.

Hemodialysis patients were identified using rare incurable disease codes (V001) or prescription of medical fee codes of hemodialysis (O7020 and O7021). We only included patients who had been maintained on hemodialysis for more than 90\u200adays from the date of dialysis initiation, to exclude patients who required short-term dialysis for acute kidney injury, conversion to peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation.During the 16-year follow-up, the number of hemodialysis patients in Korea has steadily increased from 11,215 in 2002 to 67,486 in 2017.

Yet, only IDO1 inhibitors had entered clinical trials so far, and those agents have generated disappointing clinical results. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the immune-regulatory function of the tryptophan catabolism is likely to optimise therapeutic strategies to block this pathway. The immunosuppressive role of tryptophan metabolite kynurenine is becoming increasingly clear, but it remains a mystery if tryptophan exerts functions beyond serving as a precursor for kynurenine. Here we hypothesise that tryptophan acts as a rheostat of kynurenine-mediated immunosuppression by competing with kynurenine for entry into immune T-cells through the amino acid transporter called System L. This hypothesis stems from the observations that elevated tryptophan levels in TDO-knockout mice relieve immunosuppression instigated by IDO1, and that the vacancy of System L transporter modulates kynurenine entry into CD4+ T-cells. This hypothesis has two potential therapeutic implications. Firstly, potent TDO inhibitors are expected to indirectly inhibit IDO1 hence development of TDO-selective inhibitors appears advantageous compared to IDO1-selective and dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors. Secondly, oral supplementation with System L substrates such as leucine represents a novel potential therapeutic modality to restrain the immunosuppressive kynurenine and restore anti-tumour immunity.", "Keywords": ["AhR", "IDO1", "System L", "TDO", "immunotherapy", "inhibitors", "kynurenine", "tryptophan"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase", "Kynurenine", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Neoplasms", "Tryptophan", "Tryptophan Oxygenase", "Tumor Escape", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Petr", "Last Name": "Tomek", "Affiliation": "Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33649350", "Title": "Reduced cortical gyrification in the posteromedial cortex in unaffected relatives of schizophrenia patients with high genetic loading.", "Abstract": "Although abnormal cortical gyrification has been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia, whether gyrification abnormalities reflect a genetic risk for the disorder remains unknown. This study investigated differences in cortical gyrification between unaffected relatives (URs) with high genetic loading for schizophrenia and healthy controls (HCs) to identify potential genetic vulnerability markers. A total of 50 URs of schizophrenia patients and 50 matched HCs underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to compare whole-brain gyrification using the local gyrification index (lGI). Then, the lGI clusters showing significant differences were compared between the UR subgroups based on the number of first-degree relatives with schizophrenia to identify the effect of genetic loading on cortical gyrification changes. The URs exhibited significantly lower cortical gyrification than the HCs in clusters including medial parieto-occipital and cingulate regions comprising the bilateral precuneus, cuneus, pericalcarine, lingual, isthmus cingulate, and posterior cingulate gyri.

Herein, we focus on the response and resistance to current antiangiogenic drugs and immunotherapies and describe potential strategies for improved treatment outcomes. Antiangiogenic treatments that mainly target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling have shown efficacy in many types of cancer. However, drug resistance, characterized by disease recurrence, has limited therapeutic success and thus increased our urgency to better understand the mechanism of resistance to inhibitors of VEGF signaling. Moreover, cancer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which stimulate antitumor immunity, have also demonstrated a remarkable clinical benefit in the treatment of many aggressive malignancies. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance to immunotherapies associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has restricted therapeutic response, necessitating the development of better therapeutic strategies to increase treatment efficacy in patients. Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), which binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 in endothelial cells, is a cooperative driver of angiogenesis and vascular destabilization along with VEGF. It has been suggested in multiple preclinical studies that ANG2-mediated vascular changes contribute to the development and persistence of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Further, emerging evidence suggests a fundamental link between vascular abnormalities and tumor immune evasion, supporting the rationale for combination strategies of immunotherapy with antiangiogenic drugs. In this review, we discuss the recent mechanistic and clinical advances in targeting angiopoietin signaling, focusing on ANG2 inhibition, to enhance therapeutic efficacy of antiangiogenic and ICI therapies. In short, we propose that a better mechanistic understanding of ANG2-mediated vascular changes will provide insight into the significance of ANG2 in treatment response and resistance to current antiangiogenic and ICI therapies. These advances will ultimately improve therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment.", "Keywords": ["ANG2", "antiangiogenic therapy", "cancer treatment", "immunotherapy", "resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Angiopoietin-2", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Receptor, TIE-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2020Nov18"}, {"PMID": "33214559", "Title": "Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a 10-year retrospective study in a Korean tertiary hospital.", "Abstract": "Extensive research has been carried out on the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic medications. Most studies, however, have been performed in Western countries. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness, indicated by time to any-cause discontinuation, of antipsychotic drugs in a large number of patients with schizophrenia in South Korea. We identified 1458 patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder who were treated with antipsychotic medications using a clinical data warehouse at the Seoul National University Hospital between March 2005 and February 2014. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate the time to discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. We compared the survival curves of different antipsychotics using log-rank tests. Overall, the median time to discontinuation for any cause was 133 days (95% CI, 126-147). The longest time to discontinuation was observed for clozapine, followed by aripiprazole, paliperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and haloperidol. Specifically, clozapine was significantly different from all other antipsychotic drugs (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Aripiprazole also had a significantly longer time to discontinuation than amisulpride (p\u2009=\u20090.001), risperidone (p\u2009<\u20090.001), quetiapine (p\u2009<\u20090.001), ziprasidone (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and haloperidol (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

We aimed to identify the OCD subgroups based on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and to explore their differences in treatment responses via a multivariate approach. From the resting-state functional MRI data of 107 medication-free OCD patients and 110 healthy controls (HCs), we selected rsFC features, which discriminated OCD patients from HCs via support vector machine (SVM) analyses. With the selected brain features, we subdivided OCD patients into subgroups using hierarchical clustering analyses. We identified 35 rsFC features that achieved a high sensitivity (82.74%) and specificity (76.29%) in SVM analyses. The OCD patients were subdivided into two subgroups, which did not show significant differences in their demographic and clinical backgrounds. However, one of the OCD subgroups demonstrated more impaired rsFC that was involved either within the default mode network (DMN) or between DMN brain regions and other network regions. This subgroup also showed both lower improvements in symptom severity in the 16-week follow-up visit and lower responder percentage than the other subgroup. Our results highlight that not only abnormalities within the DMN but also aberrant rsFC between the DMN and other networks may contribute to the treatment response and support the importance of these neurobiological alterations in OCD patients.

Compared to HCs, OCD patients exhibited significantly larger FC between the RN and temporal cortices including the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), paracingulate gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, thalamus, and brain stem. Greater RN-left MTG FC was positively correlated with OC symptom severity at baseline. In addition, larger FC of the RN-left MTG was also found in SSRI nonresponders compared to responders, which was a significant predictor of SSRI response after 16 weeks.

Results: In the subdomains of shift, attention, and fluency, CHR individuals and FEP patients showed deficits compared to HC. The post hoc analysis revealed that CHR individuals had comparable attention shifting and phonemic fluency compared to FEP. CHR showed intermediate deficits between FEP and HCs in spatial working memory and semantic fluency, and the largest effect size was observed in semantic fluency both for CHR and FEP.

The reduced amplitude, prolonged latency, and increased intertrial variability of auditory P300 have been consistently reported in relation to the symptomatic severity of schizophrenia. This study investigated whether auditory P300 event-related potentials can be used as an objective indicator of symptomatic improvement by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. Ten patients with schizophrenia received 20 minutes of 2-mA tDCS twice a day for 5 consecutive weekdays. The anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode was placed over the left temporo-parietal cortex. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the auditory P300 were measured for each participant at baseline and after the completion of the tDCS applications. Results. The participants showed significant improvement in the positive and negative symptoms as indexed by change in the PANSS scores by the tDCS. The P300 amplitude, latency, and intertrial variability did not statistically significantly differ after the tDCS application. However, a significant association was observed between the reduced P300 intertrial variability and improvement in the positive symptoms by tDCS. In addition, the changes in both the P300 latency and intertrial variability were significantly correlated with reduced negative symptoms after the tDCS application. Conclusions.

Therefore, we evaluated eye-movement patterns during text reading in patients with OCD or IGD. In total, 20 patients with OCD, 28 patients with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) participated in the reading task using an eye tracker. We compared the fixation durations (FDs), saccade amplitudes and eye-movement regressions of the three groups during reading. We explored relationships between the parameters reflecting altered reading patterns and those reflecting the severity of clinical symptoms. The average FDs and forward saccade amplitudes did not differ significantly among the groups. There were more eye-movement regressions in patients with OCD than in patients with IGD and HCs. No correlation was found between altered eye-movement patterns during reading and the severity of clinical symptoms in any of the patient groups. The significantly increased number of regressions (NRs) in the OCD group during reading may reflect these patients' difficulties with inferential information processing, whereas the reading pattern in the IGD group is relatively intact.

Attentional bias toward addiction-related cues is the core feature of addiction that is associated with craving, but the pathophysiology of attentional bias in IGD is not well-understood, such as its relationship to compulsivity. In this study, we used the electrophysiological marker of late positive potential (LPP) to compare attentional bias in IGD and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Twenty patients with IGD, 20 patients with OCD, and 23 healthy control (HC) subjects viewed a series of game-related, OCD-related, and neutral pictures while their event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The game-related cues included in-game screen captures of popular internet games. The OCD-related cues included pictures which provokes obsessive and compulsive symptoms of contamination/washing or checking. LPPs were calculated as the mean value of amplitudes between 350 and 750 ms at the centro-parietal (CP1, CPz, CP2) and parietal (P1, Pz, P2) electrode sites. Higher LPP amplitudes were found for game-related cues in the IGD group than in the HCs, and higher LPP amplitudes were observed in the OCD group for OCD-related cues. The IGD group did not exhibit LPP changes in response to OCD-related cues. Subjective scales demonstrated increased arousal to game-related cues and OCD-related cues in both the IGD and OCD groups compared with the HC group. Increased LPPs in response to disorder-specific cues (game-related and OCD-related) were found in both IGD and OCD groups respectively, although the groups showed overlapping arousal on subjective scales.

In addition, the importance of early changes has been highlighted, which in turn has led to investigations of the thalamo-cortical system using non-invasive neuroimaging methods.

The proportion of people with these clinical risk syndromes who will develop psychosis rather than to other nonpsychotic mental disorders is undetermined. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting on clinical risk syndromes for the development of emergent nonpsychotic mental disorders. Incidence of emerging psychotic and nonpsychotic mental disorders defined on the ICD or DSM. Of a total of 9 studies relating to 3006 nonpsychotic at-risk individuals were included. Within prospective studies (n = 4, sample = 1051), the pooled incidence of new psychotic disorders across these clinical risk syndromes was of 12.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 4.3 to 38.6) and that of nonpsychotic disorders (n = 3, sample = 538) was of 43.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 30.9 to 61.3). Psychotic disorders may emerge outside the CHR-P paradigm, from clinical risk syndromes for incident nonpsychotic disorders, albeit at lower rates than in the CHR-P group. The clinical risk syndromes for emerging nonpsychotic disorders may exhibit a pluripotential risk of developing several types of mental disorders compared with CHR-P.

In this study, we assessed the potential of mpJX-594 (mouse-prototype JX-594), a replication-competent vaccinia virus administered by intravenous injection, to target the tumor vasculature, produce immune activation and tumor cell killing more widespread than the infection, and suppress invasion and metastasis. These actions were examined in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that developed spontaneously and progressed as in humans. mpJX-594 initially infected tumor vascular endothelial cells, leading to vascular pruning and prolonged leakage in tumors but not in normal organs; parallel effects were observed in U87 gliomas. Viral infection spread to tumor cells, where tumor cell killing was much more widespread than the infection. Widespread tumor cell killing at 5 days was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes and did not require GM-CSF, as mpJX-594 variants that expressed human, mouse, or no GM-CSF produced equivalent amounts of killing. The antivascular, antitumor, and antimetastatic effects of mpJX-594 were amplified by concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib, a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These effects were not mimicked by selective inhibition of VEGFR2 despite equivalent vascular pruning, but were accompanied by suppression of regulatory T cells and greater influx of activated CD8+ T cells. Together, our results showed that mpJX-594 targets tumor blood vessels, spreads secondarily to tumor cells, and produces widespread CD8+ T-cell-dependent tumor cell killing in primary tumors and metastases, and that these effects can be amplified by coadministration of sunitinib.Significance: These findings reveal multiple unrecognized features of the antitumor properties of oncolytic vaccinia viruses, all of which can be amplified by the multitargeted kinase inhibitor sunitinib.

Pathological disruptions in these networks often result in brain dysfunction, which manifests as brain disease. Typical analysis investigates disruptions in network connectivity based correlations between large brain regions. To obtain a more detailed description of disruptions in network connectivity, we propose a new method where functional nodes are identified in each region based on their maximum connectivity to another brain region in a given network. Since this method provides a unique approach to identifying functionally relevant nodes in a given network, we can provide a more detailed map of brain connectivity and determine new measures of network connectivity.

A limited understanding of ANG signaling mechanisms and the orphan receptor Tie1 has hindered development of ANG/Tie-targeted therapeutics. Here, we determined that both ANG1 and ANG2 binding to Tie2 increases Tie1-Tie2 interactions in a \u03b21 integrin-dependent manner and that Tie1 regulates ANG-induced Tie2 trafficking in endothelial cells. Endothelial Tie1 was essential for the agonist activity of ANG1 and autocrine ANG2. Deletion of endothelial Tie1 in mice reduced Tie2 phosphorylation and downstream Akt activation, increased FOXO1 nuclear localization and transcriptional activation, and prevented ANG1- and ANG2-induced capillary-to-venous remodeling. However, in acute endotoxemia, the Tie1 ectodomain that is responsible for interaction with Tie2 was rapidly cleaved, ANG1 agonist activity was decreased, and autocrine ANG2 agonist activity was lost, which led to suppression of Tie2 signaling. Tie1 cleavage also occurred in patients with hantavirus infection.

While ANG2 competes with ANG1 to inhibit Tie2, it can paradoxically also promote Tie2 phosphorylation (p-Tie2). A related paradox is that both inactivation and overactivation of Tie2 can result in vascular remodeling. Here, we reconciled these opposing actions of ANG2 by manipulating conditions that govern its actions in the vasculature. ANG2 drove vascular remodeling during Mycoplasma pulmonis infection by acting as a Tie2 antagonist, which led to p-Tie2 suppression, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) activation, increased ANG2 expression, and vessel leakiness. These changes were exaggerated by anti-Tie2 antibody, inhibition of PI3K signaling, or ANG2 overexpression and were reduced by anti-ANG2 antibody or exogenous ANG1. In contrast, under pathogen-free conditions, ANG2 drove vascular remodeling by acting as an agonist, promoting high p-Tie2, low FOXO1 activation, and no leakage. Tie1 activation was strong under pathogen-free conditions, but infection or TNF-\u03b1 led to Tie1 inactivation by ectodomain cleavage and promoted the Tie2 antagonist action of ANG2. Together, these data indicate that ANG2 activation of Tie2 supports stable enlargement of normal nonleaky vessels, but reduction of Tie1 in inflammation leads to ANG2 antagonism of Tie2 and initiates a positive feedback loop wherein FOXO1-driven ANG2 expression promotes vascular remodeling and leakage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Angiopoietin-2", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Endothelial Cells", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Female", "Forkhead Box Protein O1", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mycoplasma pulmonis", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Protein Domains", "Receptor, TIE-2", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Vascular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Breanna", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emilia A", "Last Name": "Korhonen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Nitschk\u00e9", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Baluk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pipsa", "Last Name": "Saharinen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kari", "Last Name": "Alitalo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Daly", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gavin", "Last Name": "Thurston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald M", "Last Name": "McDonald", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2016Sep01"}, {"PMID": "27334354", "Title": "Candida guilliermondii continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis confirmed by 16s rRNA sequencing.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antifungal Agents", "Candida", "Candidiasis", "DNA, Fungal", "Fluconazole", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory", "Peritonitis", "Predictive Value of Tests", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Renal Dialysis", "Ribotyping", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, 501-757, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eun Hui", "Last Name": "Bae", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, 501-757, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Soo Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, 501-757, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seong Kwon", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, 501-757, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)", "PubDate": "2016Jul"}, {"PMID": "27329797", "Title": "Synthesis and evaluation of (+)-decursin derivatives as inhibitors of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.", "Abstract": "We synthesized (+)-decursin derivatives substituted with cinnamoyl- and phenyl propionyl groups originating from (+)-CGK062 and screened them using a cell-based assay to detect relative luciferase reporter activity.

The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins",

Although yeast cell-free enzyme system is known since long ago, it is rarely been studied and characterized in detail. In this review, we hope to describe the major pitfalls encountered by whole-cell system and introduce possible solutions to them using cell-free enzyme systems. We have discussed the glycolytic and fermentative pathways and their regulation at both transcription and translational levels. Moreover, several strategies employed for development of cell-free enzyme system have been described with their potential merits and shortcomings associated with these developmental approaches. We also described in detail the various developmental approaches of synthetic cell-free enzyme system such as compartmentalization, metabolic channeling, protein fusion, and co-immobilization strategies. Additionally, we portrayed the novel cell-free enzyme technologies based on encapsulation and immobilization techniques and their development and commercialization.

These findings suggest that MMN may reflect current functional status rather than a genetic risk for schizophrenia.", "Keywords": ["Event-related potential", "Functional status", "Genetic high risk", "Mismatch negativity", "Schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sung Nyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute of Human Behavioral Sciences, Seoul National University, Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Suji", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Min Soo", "Last Name": "Byun", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute of Human Behavioral Sciences, Seoul National University, Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kyung Soon", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Behavioral Sciences, Seoul National University, Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hye Youn", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Joon Hwan", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jun Soo", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute of Human Behavioral Sciences, Seoul National University, Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Brain and Cognitive Science, Seoul National University College of Natural Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

The moisture and sugar contents were increased depending on the period of aging times and the pH was reduced thereby increasing acidity. The color of black jujube extract was changed from red to black resulting in decreases of Hunter color values L, a and b. As the aging progressed, sucrose was decomposed by increasing glucose and fructose, indicating higher contents of the total reducing sugars. Among the six different types of organic acids extracted from dried jujube, the levels of oxalic acid and citric acid were increased as the aging progressed. The total polyphenol contents in ethanol and water extracts of dried jujube were 7.74 and 8.12 mg/g, respectively. The water extract of black jujube aged for 48 hr contained the highest polyphenol contents at 16.82 mg/g. The 5'-hydroxymethylfurfural (5'-HMF) contents of black jujube extract significantly increased by longer aging times, and contained higher contents in the ethanol extract than water extract. The ethanol extract of black jujube showed the highest 5'-HMF content with 338.89 mg% after aging for 3 days. Also, IC50 values of black jujube aged for 72 hr evaluated by DPPH and ABTS radical assays were 0.54 and 0.59 mg/mL, respectively. \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitory activities of black jujube at the concentration of 3.33 mg/mL (ethanol extract) increased from 65 to 80 % after aging for 72 hr.", "Keywords": ["aging", "antioxidant", "black jujube", "organic acid", "\u03b1-glucosidase"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ji-Eun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Min-Ah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jung-Seok", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Dong-Cheol", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Hotel Cuisine and Food Service Management, Gimcheon University, Gyeongbuk 740-704, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sam-Pin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Korea ; The Center for Traditional Microorganism Resource (TMR), Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Korea."}], "Journal": "Preventive nutrition and food science", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "24331568", "Title": "Does upper premolar extraction affect the changes of pharyngeal airway volume after bimaxillary surgery in skeletal class III patients?", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the pharyngeal airway volume change after bimaxillary surgery in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and evaluate the difference in postoperative pharyngeal airway space between upper premolar extraction cases and nonextraction cases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bicuspid", "Cephalometry", "Chin", "Cone-Beam Computed Tomography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genioplasty", "Humans", "Hypopharynx", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Incisor", "Male", "Malocclusion, Angle Class III", "Mandible", "Maxilla", "Nasal Bone", "Nasopharynx", "Oropharynx", "Orthognathic Surgical Procedures", "Osteotomy, Le Fort", "Osteotomy, Sagittal Split Ramus", "Palate", "Pharynx", "Prognathism", "Rotation", "Sella Turcica", "Tooth Extraction", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min-Ah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Resident, Department of Orthodontics, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yang-Ho", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Professor, Department of Orthodontics, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.

Here we show that dynamic and variable decidual angiogenesis (sprouting, intussusception and networking), and active vigorous vascular remodelling such as enlargement and elongation of 'vascular sinus folding' (VSF) and mural cell drop-out occur distinctly in a spatiotemporal manner in the rapidly growing mouse uterus during early pregnancy - just after implantation but before placentation. Decidual angiogenesis is mainly regulated through VEGF-A secreted from the progesterone receptor (PR)-expressing decidual stromal cells which are largely distributed in the anti-mesometrial region (AMR). In comparison, P4 -PR-regulated VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signalling, ligand-independent VEGFR3 signalling and uterine natural killer (uNK) cells positively and coordinately regulate enlargement and elongation of VSF. During the postpartum period, Tie2 signalling could be involved in vascular maturation at the endometrium in a ligand-independent manner, with marked reduction of VEGF-A, VEGFR2 and PR expressions. Overall, we show that two key vascular growth factor receptors - VEGFR2 and Tie2 - strikingly but differentially regulate decidual angiogenesis and vascular remodelling in rapidly growing and regressing uteri in an organotypic manner.", "Keywords": ["VEGF-A", "decidual angiogenesis", "pregnant uterus", "vascular regression", "vascular sinus folding"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Decidua", "Female", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Biological", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Pregnancy", "Progesterone", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Vascular Biology and Stem Cells and Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyeung Ju", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jae Won", "Last Name": "Seol", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeon Yeob", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Young-Suk", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kyu Rae", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youngsok", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Lydon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco J", "Last Name": "Demayo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masabumi", "Last Name": "Shibuya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Napoleone", "Last Name": "Ferrara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hoon-Ki", "Last Name": "Sung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andras", "Last Name": "Nagy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kari", "Last Name": "Alitalo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gou Young", "Last Name": "Koh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "EMBO molecular medicine", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23311605", "Title": "Three-dimensional changes of the hyoid bone and airway volumes related to its relationship with horizontal anatomic planes after bimaxillary surgery in skeletal Class III patients.", "Abstract": "To evaluate longitudinal changes of the hyoid bone position and pharyngeal airway space after bimaxillary surgery in mandibular prognathism patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cephalometry", "Cone-Beam Computed Tomography", "Epiglottis", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genioplasty", "Humans", "Hyoid Bone", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Malocclusion, Angle Class III", "Mandible", "Maxilla", "Middle Aged", "Nasal Bone", "Orthodontics, Corrective", "Orthognathic Surgical Procedures", "Osteotomy, Le Fort", "Osteotomy, Sagittal Split Ramus", "Palate", "Palate, Soft", "Pharynx", "Prognathism", "Rotation", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min-Ah", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Bo-Ram", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jin-Young", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jong-Kuk", "Last Name": "Youn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yoon-Ji R", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang-Ho", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Angle orthodontist", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "22512774", "Title": "What is driving people's dissatisfaction with their own health care in 17 Latin American countries?", "Abstract": "A number of expert reports have pointed to serious problems with health care in many Latin American countries and argued the need to reform and improve health-care systems.
