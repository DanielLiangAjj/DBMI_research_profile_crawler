[{"PMID": "38895232", "Title": "RESPAN: an accurate, unbiased and automated pipeline for analysis of dendritic morphology and dendritic spine mapping.", "Abstract": "Accurate and unbiased reconstructions of neuronal morphology, including quantification of dendritic spine morphology and distribution, are widely used in neuroscience but remain a major roadblock for large-scale analysis. Traditionally, spine analysis has required labor-intensive manual annotation, which is prone to human error and impractical for large 3D datasets. Previous automated tools for reconstructing neuronal morphology and quantitative dendritic spine analysis face challenges in generating accurate results and, following close inspection, often require extensive manual correction. While recent tools leveraging deep learning approaches have substantially increased accuracy, they lack functionality and useful outputs, necessitating additional tools to perform a complete analysis and limiting their utility. In this paper, we describe Restoration Enhanced SPine And Neuron (RESPAN) analysis, a new comprehensive pipeline developed as an open-source, easily deployable solution that harnesses recent advances in deep learning and GPU processing. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, validated extensively across a range of imaging modalities for automated dendrite and spine mapping. It also offers extensive visual and tabulated data outputs, including detailed morphological and spatial metrics, dendritic spine classification, and 3D renderings. Additionally, RESPAN includes tools for validating results, ensuring scientific rigor and reproducibility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sergio B", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexa P", "Last Name": "Schlotter", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon 1400-038, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Franck", "Last Name": "Polleux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luke A", "Last Name": "Hammond", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun08"}, {"PMID": "38895210", "Title": "PDZD8-FKBP8 tethering complex at ER-mitochondria contact sites regulates mitochondrial complexity.", "Abstract": "Mitochondria-ER membrane contact sites (MERCS) represent a fundamental ultrastructural feature underlying unique biochemistry and physiology in eukaryotic cells. The ER protein PDZD8 is required for the formation of MERCS in many cell types, however, its tethering partner on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is currently unknown. Here we identified the OMM protein FKBP8 as the tethering partner of PDZD8 using a combination of unbiased proximity proteomics, CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous protein tagging, Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) tomography, and correlative light-EM (CLEM). Single molecule tracking revealed highly dynamic diffusion properties of PDZD8 along the ER membrane with significant pauses and capture at MERCS. Overexpression of FKBP8 was sufficient to narrow the ER-OMM distance, whereas independent versus combined deletions of these two proteins demonstrated their interdependence for MERCS formation. Furthermore, PDZD8 enhances mitochondrial complexity in a FKBP8-dependent manner.

Distal tuft dendrites are widely thought to initiate place field formation by locally generating prolonged, globally-spreading Ca 2+ spikes known as plateau potentials. However, the hitherto experimental inaccessibility of distal tuft dendrites in the hippocampus has rendered their in vivo function entirely unknown. Here we gained direct optical access to this elusive dendritic compartment. We report that distal tuft dendrites do not serve as the point of origin for place field-forming plateau potentials. Instead, the timing and extent of peri-formation distal tuft recruitment is variable and closely predicts multiple properties of resultant place fields. Therefore, distal tuft dendrites play a more powerful role in hippocampal feature selectivity than simply initiating place field formation. Moreover, place field formation is not accompanied by global Ca 2+ influx as previously thought. In addition to shaping new somatic place fields, distal tuft dendrites possess their own local place fields. Tuft place fields are back-shifted relative to that of their soma and appear to maintain somatic place fields via post-formation plateau potentials.

The protective effects of pdzd8 knockdown in neurons correlate with an increase in mitophagy, suggesting that increased mitochondrial turnover may support healthy aging of neurons. In contrast, increasing MERCs by expressing a constitutive, synthetic ER-mitochondria tether disrupts mitochondrial transport and synapse formation, accelerates age-related decline in locomotion, and reduces lifespan.

Here we show that the increased number of excitatory synapses received by layer 2/3 PNs induced by SRGAP2C expression originates from a specific increase in local and long-range cortico-cortical connections. Mice humanized for SRGAP2C expression in all cortical PNs displayed a shift in the fraction of layer 2/3 PNs activated by sensory stimulation and an enhanced ability to learn a cortex-dependent sensory-discrimination task. Computational modelling revealed that the increased layer 4 to layer 2/3 connectivity induced by SRGAP2C expression explains some of the key changes in sensory coding properties. These results suggest that the emergence of SRGAP2C at the birth of the Homo lineage contributed to the evolution of specific structural and functional features of cortical circuits in the human cortex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Calcium Signaling", "Cerebral Cortex", "Discrimination, Psychological", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Pathways", "Organ Size", "Pyramidal Cells", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ewoud R E", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanzhi T", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Srgap2 interacts with the cell membrane to locally inhibit activity of Rac1. In this study, we determined the role of Srgap2 in the myeloid lineage on bone homeostasis and the osteoclastic response to TNF\u03b1 treatment. The bone phenotype of mice specifically lacking Srgap2 in the myeloid lineage (Srgap2 f/f :LysM-Cre; Srgap2 conditional knockout [cKO]) was investigated using histomorphometric analysis, in vitro cultures and Western blot analysis. Similar methods were used to determine the impact of TNF\u03b1 challenge on osteoclast formation in Srgap2 cKO mice. Bone parameters in male Srgap2 cKO mice were unaffected. However, female cKO mice displayed higher trabecular bone volume due to increased osteoblast surface and bone formation rate, whereas osteoclastic parameters were unaltered. In vitro, cells from Srgap2 cKO had strongly enhanced Rac1 activation, but RANKL-induced osteoclast formation was unaffected. In contrast, conditioned medium from Srgap2 cKO osteoclasts promoted osteoblast differentiation and had increased levels of the bone anabolic clastokine SLIT3, providing a possible mechanism for increased bone formation in vivo. Rac1 is rapidly activated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1. Supracalvarial injection of TNF\u03b1 caused an augmented osteoclastic response in Srgap2 cKO mice. In vitro, cells from Srgap2 cKO mice displayed increased osteoclast formation in response to TNF\u03b1.

Here, we investigated mechanisms by which neutrophils break their symmetry and initiate their cytoskeleton polarization from an apolar state in circulation for their extravasation during inflammation. We show here that a local increase in plasma membrane (PM) curvature resulting from cell contact to a surface triggers the initial breakage of the symmetry of an apolar neutrophil and is required for subsequent polarization events induced by chemical stimulation. This local increase in PM curvature recruits SRGAP2 via its F-BAR domain, which in turn activates PI4KA and results in PM PtdIns4P polarization. Polarized PM PtdIns4P is targeted by RPH3A, which directs PIP5K1C90 and subsequent phosphorylated myosin light chain polarization, and this polarization signaling axis regulates neutrophil firm attachment to endothelium.

In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells.

Therefore, more than any other cell types, neurons are critically dependent on spatially and temporally controlled Ca2+ dynamics. This is achieved through an exquisite level of compartmentalization of Ca2+ storage and release from various organelles. The function of these organelles in the regulation of Ca2+ dynamics has been studied for decades using electrophysiological and optical methods combined with pharmacological and genetic alterations. Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are among the organelles playing the most critical roles in Ca2+ dynamics in neurons. At presynaptic boutons, Ca2+ triggers neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, and postsynaptically, Ca2+ mobilization mediates long-term synaptic plasticity. To explore Ca2+ dynamics in live cells and intact animals, various synthetic and genetically encoded fluorescent Ca2+ sensors were developed, and recently, many groups actively increased the sensitivity and diversity of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs). Following conjugation with various signal peptides, these improved GECIs can be targeted to specific subcellular compartments, allowing monitoring of organelle-specific Ca2+ dynamics.

Mitochondria are essential for proper biological function as a result of their ability to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, buffer cytoplasmic calcium, regulate lipid biosynthesis, and trigger apoptosis (reviewed in [2]). Efficient transport of mitochondria is thought to be particularly important in neurons in light of their compartmentalization,\u00a0length of axonal processes, and high-energy requirements (reviewed in [3]). However, the majority of these results were obtained using short-term, in\u00a0vitro neuronal culture models, and very little is currently known about mitochondrial dynamics in mature axons of the mammalian CNS in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo. Furthermore, recent evidence has demonstrated that mitochondrial immobilization at specific points along the axon,\u00a0such as presynaptic boutons, play critical roles in axon morphogenesis [4, 5]. We report that as cortical axons mature, motility of mitochondria (but not other cargoes) is dramatically reduced and this coincides with increased localization to presynaptic sites. We also demonstrate\u00a0using photo-conversion that in\u00a0vitro mature\u00a0axons display surprisingly limited long-range mitochondrial transport. Finally, using in\u00a0vivo two-photon microscopy in anesthetized or awake-behaving mice, we document for the first\u00a0time that mitochondrial motility is also remarkably low in distal cortical axons in\u00a0vivo.

However, it remains unknown which SNAREs promote the secretion of neuronal proteins, including those essential for circuit development and experience-dependent plasticity. Here we demonstrate that Syb2 and SNAP25 mediate the vesicular release of BDNF in axons and dendrites of cortical neurons, suggesting these SNAREs act in multiple spatially segregated secretory pathways. Remarkably, axonal secretion of BDNF is also strongly regulated by SNAP47, which interacts with SNAP25 but appears to be dispensable for exocytosis of SVs. Cell-autonomous ablation of SNAP47 disrupts the layer-specific branching of callosal axons of projection cortical neurons in vivo, and this phenotype is recapitulated by ablation of BDNF or its receptor, TrkB.

Previous studies have indicated that the Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 may ubiquitinate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and thereby regulate axonal growth in neurons. Using conditional knockout mice, we show here that Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are indeed required for axonal growth in murine central nervous system neurons. However, in contrast to previously published data, we demonstrate that PTEN is not a substrate of Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2, and that aberrant PTEN ubiquitination is not involved in the impaired axon growth upon deletion of Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2. Rather, PTEN limits Nedd4-1 protein levels by modulating the activity of mTORC1, a protein complex that controls protein synthesis and cell growth. Our data demonstrate that Nedd4-family E3 ligases promote axonal growth and branching in the developing mammalian brain, where PTEN is not a relevant substrate.
