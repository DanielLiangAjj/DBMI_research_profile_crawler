[{"PMID": "38927583", "Title": "Revolutionizing Brain Tumor Care: Emerging Technologies and Strategies.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive forms of brain tumor, characterized by a daunting prognosis with a life expectancy hovering around 12-16 months. Despite a century of relentless research, only a select few drugs have received approval for brain tumor treatment, largely due to the formidable barrier posed by the blood-brain barrier. The current standard of care involves a multifaceted approach combining surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy. However, recurrence often occurs within months despite these interventions. The formidable challenges of drug delivery to the brain and overcoming therapeutic resistance have become focal points in the treatment of brain tumors and are deemed essential to overcoming tumor recurrence. In recent years, a promising wave of advanced treatments has emerged, offering a glimpse of hope to overcome the limitations of existing therapies. This review aims to highlight cutting-edge technologies in the current and ongoing stages of development, providing patients with valuable insights to guide their choices in brain tumor treatment.", "Keywords": ["TTFields", "artificial intelligence (AI)", "external beam radiation therapy", "fMRI", "gene and cell therapy", "glioblastoma multiforme", "immunotherapy", "targeted therapy", "temozolomide"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Trang T T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Ronald O.

Though such peptides have the potential for clinical application, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Here, we show that one such peptide, Dpep, compromises glucose uptake and glycolysis in a cell context-dependent manner (in about two-thirds of cancer lines assessed). These actions are dependent on induction of tumor suppressor TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) mRNA and protein. Knockdown studies show that TXNIP significantly contributes to apoptotic death in those cancer cells in which it is induced by Dpep. The metabolic actions of Dpep on glycolysis led us to explore combinations of Dpep with clinically approved drugs metformin and atovaquone that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and that are in trials for cancer treatment. Dpep showed additive to synergistic activities in all lines tested. In summary, we find that Dpep induces TXNIP in a cell context-dependent manner that in turn suppresses glucose uptake and glycolysis and contributes to apoptotic death of a range of cancer cells.",

"MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma often presents as a highly aggressive metastatic disease with a poor prognosis. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is implicated in neural cell differentiation and cancer cell survival. Here, we show that ATF5 is highly expressed in patients with stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, with increased expression correlating with a poorer prognosis. We demonstrated that ATF5 promotes the metastasis of neuroblastoma cell lines in vivo. Functionally, ATF5 depletion significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow and liver. Mechanistically, ATF5 endows tumor cells with resistance to anoikis, thereby increasing their survival in systemic circulation and facilitating metastasis. We identified the proapoptotic BCL-2 modifying factor (BMF) as a critical player in ATF5-regulated neuroblastoma anoikis. ATF5 suppresses BMF under suspension conditions at the transcriptional level, promoting anoikis resistance, whereas BMF knockdown significantly prevents ATF5 depletion-induced anoikis. Therapeutically, we showed that a cell-penetrating dominant-negative ATF5 peptide, CP-d/n-ATF5, inhibits neuroblastoma metastasis to the bone marrow and liver by inducing anoikis sensitivity in circulating tumor cells. Our study identified ATF5 as a metastasis promoter and CP-d/n-ATF5 as a potential antimetastatic therapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Anoikis", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Neuroblastoma", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Activating Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Debarshi", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shuobo", "Last Name": "Boboila", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shunpei", "Last Name": "Okochi", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Angelastro", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, California."}, {"First Name": "Angela V", "Last Name": "Kadenhe-Chiweshe", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gonzalo", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eileen P", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer research communications", "PubDate": "2023Dec12"}, {"PMID": "38001578", "Title": "Dpep Inhibits Cancer Cell Growth and Survival via Shared and Context-Dependent Transcriptome Perturbations.", "Abstract": "Dpep is a cell-penetrating peptide targeting transcription factors ATF5, CEBPB, and CEBPD, and that selectively promotes the apoptotic death of multiple tumor cell types in vitro and in vivo. As such, it is a potential therapeutic. To better understand its mechanism of action, we used PLATE-seq to compare the transcriptomes of six cancer cell lines of diverse origins before and after Dpep exposure. This revealed a context-dependent pattern of regulated genes that was unique to each line, but that exhibited a number of elements that were shared with other lines. This included the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and tumor suppressors as well as the enrichment of genes associated with responses to hypoxia and interferons. Downregulated transcripts included oncogenes and dependency genes, as well as enriched genes associated with different phases of the cell cycle and with DNA repair. In each case, such changes have the potential to lie upstream of apoptotic cell death. We also detected the regulation of unique as well as shared sets of transcription factors in each line, suggesting that Dpep may initiate a cascade of transcriptional responses that culminate in cancer cell death. Such death thus appears to reflect context-dependent, yet shared, disruption of multiple cellular pathways as well as of individual survival-relevant genes.", "Keywords": ["ATF5", "CEBPB", "CEBPD", "Dpep", "apoptosis", "cell cycle", "dependency genes", "gene enrichment", "transcriptome", "tumor suppressors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cancers", "PubDate": "2023Nov07"}, {"PMID": "37100955", "Title": "Apoptotic cell death in disease-Current understanding of the NCCD 2023.", "Abstract": "Apoptosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that involves proteases of the caspase family.

strategies. In this review, we recount the evidence identifying the basic leucine zipper transcription factors ATF5, CEBPB, and CEBPD as targets for brain and other malignancies. We describe strategies that exploit the structures of the three factors to create inhibitory dominant-negative (DN) mutant forms that selectively suppress growth and survival of cancer cells. We then discuss and compare four peptides (CP-DN-ATF5, Dpep, Bpep and ST101) in which DN sequences are joined with cell-penetrating domains to create drugs that pass through tissue barriers and into cells. The peptide drugs show both efficacy and safety in suppressing growth and in the survival of brain and other cancers in vivo, and ST101 is currently in clinical trials for solid tumors, including GBM. We further consider known mechanisms by which the peptides act and how these have been exploited in rationally designed combination therapies. We additionally discuss lacunae in our knowledge about the peptides that merit further research. Finally, we suggest both short- and long-term directions for creating new generations of drugs targeting ATF5, CEBPB, CEBPD, and other transcription factors for treating brain and other malignancies.", "Keywords": ["ATF5", "CEBPB", "CEBPD", "brain cancer", "cell-penetrating", "decoy", "dominant-negative", "drug", "glioblastoma", "transcription factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cell-Penetrating Peptides", "Neoplasms", "Brain", "Drug Development", "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta", "Activating Transcription Factors", "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Angelastro", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2023Feb11"}, {"PMID": "34065488", "Title": "Cell-Penetrating CEBPB and CEBPD Leucine Zipper Decoys as Broadly Acting Anti-Cancer Agents.", "Abstract": "Transcription factors are key players underlying cancer formation, growth, survival, metastasis and treatment resistance, yet few drugs exist to directly target them. Here, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of novel synthetic cell-penetrating peptides (Bpep and Dpep) designed to interfere with the formation of active leucine-zipper-based dimers by CEBPB and CEBPD, transcription factors implicated in multiple malignancies. Both peptides similarly promoted apoptosis of multiple tumor lines of varying origins, without such effects on non-transformed cells. Combined with other treatments (radiation, Taxol, chloroquine, doxorubicin), the peptides acted additively to synergistically and were fully active on Taxol-resistant cells. The peptides suppressed expression of known direct CEBPB/CEBPD targets IL6, IL8 and asparagine synthetase (ASNS), supporting their inhibition of transcriptional activation. Mechanisms by which the peptides trigger apoptosis included depletion of pro-survival survivin and a required elevation of pro-apoptotic BMF.

However, the nature of these functions has not been well defined and is subject to apparently disparate views. Here, we provide evidence that ATF4 is a regulator of excitability during synaptic plasticity. We evaluated the role of ATF4 in mature hippocampal cultures subjected to a brief chemically induced LTP (cLTP) protocol that results in changes in mEPSC properties and synaptic AMPA receptor density 1 h later, with return to baseline by 24 h. We find that ATF4 protein, but not its mRNA, is rapidly depleted by \u223c50% in response to cLTP induction via NMDA receptor activation. Depletion is detectable in dendrites within 15\u2009min and in cell bodies by 1 h, and returns to baseline by 8 h. Such changes correlate with a parallel depletion of phospho-eIF2a, suggesting that ATF4 loss is driven by decreased translation. To probe the physiologic role of cLTP-induced ATF4 depletion, we constitutively overexpressed the protein. Reversing ATF4 depletion by overexpression blocked the recovery of synaptic activity and AMPA receptor density to baseline values that would otherwise occur 24 h after cLTP induction. This reversal was not reproduced by a transcriptionally inactive ATF4 mutant. These findings support the role of ATF4 as a required element in resetting baseline synaptic responsiveness after cLTP.", "Keywords": ["AMPA receptor", "ATF4", "LTP", "resetting synaptic activity", "synaptic plasticity"], "MeSH terms": ["Hippocampus", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Receptors, AMPA", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatou", "Last Name": "Amar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Corona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Husson", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 lag3@cumc.columbia.edu mls7@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2021May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "31911115", "Title": "The drug adaptaquin blocks ATF4/CHOP-dependent pro-death Trib3 induction and protects in cellular and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.", "Abstract": "Identifying disease-causing pathways and drugs that target them in Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained challenging. We uncovered a PD-relevant pathway in which the stress-regulated heterodimeric transcription complex CHOP/ATF4 induces the neuron prodeath protein Trib3 that in turn depletes the neuronal survival protein Parkin. Here we sought to determine whether the drug adaptaquin, which inhibits ATF4-dependent transcription, could suppress Trib3 induction and neuronal death in cellular and animal models of PD. Neuronal PC12 cells and ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons were assessed in vitro for survival, transcription factor levels and Trib3 or Parkin expression after exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium with or without adaptaquin co-treatment. 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the medial forebrain bundle was used to examine the effects of systemic adaptaquin on signaling, substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron survival and striatal projections as well as motor behavior. In both culture and animal models, adaptaquin suppressed elevation of ATF4 and/or CHOP and induction of Trib3 in response to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and/or 6-hydroxydopamine. In culture, adaptaquin preserved Parkin levels, provided neuroprotection and preserved morphology. In the mouse model, adaptaquin treatment enhanced survival of dopaminergic neurons and substantially protected their striatal projections. It also significantly enhanced retention of nigrostriatal function. These findings define a novel pharmacological approach involving the drug adaptaquin, a selective modulator of hypoxic adaptation, for suppressing Parkin loss and neurodegeneration in toxin models of PD. As adaptaquin possesses an oxyquinoline backbone with known safety in humans, these findings provide a firm rationale for advancing it towards clinical evaluation in PD.", "Keywords": ["ATF4", "Adaptaquin", "CHOP", "Neuroprotection", "Oxyquinoline", "Parkin", "Parkinson's disease", "Trib3"], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Death", "Cells, Cultured", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Oxidopamine", "PC12 Cells", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Pyridines", "Quinolines", "Rats", "Transcription Factor CHOP"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pascaline", "Last Name": "Aim\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saravanan S", "Last Name": "Karuppagounder", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, 785 Mamaroneck Ave, White Plains, NY 10605, USA; Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 407 E. 61st Street, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Apeksha", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yingxin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, 785 Mamaroneck Ave, White Plains, NY 10605, USA; Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 407 E. 61st Street, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Burke", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajiv R", "Last Name": "Ratan", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, 785 Mamaroneck Ave, White Plains, NY 10605, USA; Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 407 E. 61st Street, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, 650 W. 168(th) Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.

As a potential therapeutic approach to exploit these findings, we created dominant-negative (DN) ATF5 forms lacking DNA-binding ability that retain the ATF5 leucine zipper, and thus associate with and sequester ATF5's requisite leucine zipper-binding partners. Preclinical studies with DN-ATF5, including a cell-penetrating form, show in vitro and in vivo efficacy in compromising cancer cell survival. However, DN-ATF5's targets, and particularly those required for tumor cell survival, have been unknown. We report that cells lacking ATF5 succumb to DN-ATF5, indicating that ATF5 itself is not DN-ATF5's obligate target. Unbiased pull-down assays coupled with mass spectrometry and immunoblotting revealed that DN-ATF5 associates in cells with the basic leucine zipper proteins CEBPB and CEBPD and coiled-coil protein CCDC6. Consistent with DN-ATF5 affecting tumor cell survival by suppressing CEBPB and CEBPD function, DN-ATF5 interferes with CEBPB and CEBPD transcriptional activity, while CEBPB or CEBPD knockdown promotes apoptotic death of multiple cancer cells lines, but not of normal astrocytes. We propose a two-pronged mechanism by which DN-ATF5 kills tumor cells. One is by inhibiting heterodimer formation between ATF5 and CEBPB and CDBPD, thus suppressing ATF5-dependent transcription. The other is by blocking the formation of transcriptionally active CEBPB and CEBPD homodimers as well as heterodimers with partners in addition to ATF5.

We find that L-DOPA causes parkin loss through both oxidative stress-independent and oxidative stress-dependent pathways.

In response to stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or CCCP, parkin degradation also requires its association with phospho-Ub, indicating that this mechanism is broadly generalizable.

Here, we sought to create a conditionally-inducible form of active Akt for both in vitro and in vivo applications. We fused a ligand-responsive Destabilizing Domain (DD) derived from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase to a constitutively active mutant form of Akt1, Akt(E40K). Prior work indicated that such fusion proteins may be stabilized and induced by a ligand, the antibiotic Trimethoprim (TMP). We observed dose-dependent, reversible induction of both total and phosphorylated/active DD-Akt(E40K) by TMP across several cellular backgrounds in culture, including neurons. Phosphorylation of FoxO4, an Akt substrate, was significantly elevated after DD-Akt(E40K) induction, indicating the induced protein was functionally active. The induced Akt(E40K) protected cells from apoptosis evoked by serum deprivation and was neuroprotective in two cellular models of Parkinson's disease (6-OHDA and MPP+ exposure). There was no significant protection without induction. We also evaluated Akt(E40K) induction by TMP in mouse substantia nigra and striatum after neuronal delivery via an AAV1 adeno-associated viral vector. While there was significant induction in striatum, there was no apparent induction in substantia nigra. To explore the possible basis for this difference, we examined DD-Akt(E40K) induction in cultured ventral midbrain neurons. Both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the cultures showed DD-Akt(E40K) induction after TMP treatment. However, basal DD-Akt(E40K) expression was 3-fold higher for dopaminergic neurons, resulting in a significantly lower induction by TMP in this population. Such findings suggest that dopaminergic neurons may be relatively inefficient in protein degradation, a property that could relate to their lack of apparent DD-Akt(E40K) induction in vivo and to their selective vulnerability in Parkinson's disease.

We previously reported that specific hippocampal ATF4 downregulation causes deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory and reduction of glutamatergic functionality. Here we extend our studies to address ATF4's role in neuronal excitability. We find that long-term ATF4 knockdown in cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly increases the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. This effect is associated with decreased functionality of metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABABRs). Knocking down ATF4 results in significant reduction of GABABR-induced GIRK currents and increased mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, reducing ATF4 significantly decreases expression of membrane-exposed, but not total, GABABR 1a and 1b subunits, indicating that ATF4 regulates GABABR trafficking. In contrast, ATF4 knockdown has no effect on surface expression of GABABR2s, several GABABR-coupled ion channels or \u03b22 and \u03b32 GABAARs. Pharmacologic manipulations confirmed the relationship between GABABR functionality and action potential frequency in our cultures. Specifically, the effects of ATF4 downregulation cited above are fully rescued by transcriptionally active, but not by transcriptionally inactive, shRNA-resistant, ATF4. We previously reported that ATF4 promotes stabilization of the actin-regulatory protein Cdc42 by a transcription-dependent mechanism. To test the hypothesis that this action underlies the mechanism by which ATF4 loss affects neuronal firing rates and GABABR trafficking, we downregulated Cdc42 and found that this phenocopies the effects of ATF4 knockdown on these properties. In conclusion, our data favor a model in which ATF4, by regulating Cdc42 expression, affects trafficking of GABABRs, which in turn modulates the excitability properties of neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT GABAB receptors (GABABRs), the metabotropic receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, have crucial roles in controlling the firing rate of neurons. Deficits in trafficking/functionality of GABABRs have been linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and pain. Here we show that GABABRs trafficking is influenced by Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a protein that has a pivotal role in hippocampal memory processes. We found that ATF4 downregulation in hippocampal neurons reduces membrane-bound GABABR levels and thereby increases intrinsic excitability. These effects are mediated by loss of the small GTPase Cdc42 following ATF4 downregulation. These findings reveal a critical role for ATF4 in regulating the modulation of neuronal excitability by GABABRs.", "Keywords": ["ATF4", "Cdc42", "GABAB receptors", "GIRK channels", "neuronal excitability"], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Animals", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Neurons", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "Receptors, GABA-B", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Corona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Pasini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Fatou", "Last Name": "Amar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033 mls7@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jul04"}, {"PMID": "29599707", "Title": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Elevates Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) in Neurons and Promotes ATF4-Dependent Induction of Sesn2.", "Abstract": "Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) plays important physiologic roles in the brain including regulation of learning and memory as well as neuronal survival and death. Yet, outside of translational regulation by the eIF2\u03b1-dependent stress response pathway, there is little information about how its levels are controlled in neurons. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes a rapid and sustained increase in neuronal ATF4 transcripts and protein levels. This increase is dependent on tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrkB) signaling, but independent of levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. The elevation in ATF4 protein occurs both in nuclei and processes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ATF4 mediates BDNF-promoted induction of Sesn2 which encodes Sestrin2, a protector against oxidative and genotoxic stresses and a mTor complex 1 inhibitor. In contrast, BDNF-elevated ATF4 did not affect expression of a number of other known ATF4 targets including several with pro-apoptotic activity.

Increasing parkin levels enhances survival in models of PD-related neuronal death and is a promising therapeutic objective. Previously, we demonstrated that the transcription factor ATF4 promotes survival in response to PD-mimetic stressors by maintaining parkin levels. ATF4 translation is up-regulated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. The small molecule guanabenz enhances eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by blocking the function of GADD34, a regulatory protein that promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. We tested the hypothesis that guanabenz, by inhibiting GADD34 and consequently increasing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and elevating ATF4, would improve survival in models of PD by up-regulating parkin. We found that GADD34 is strongly induced by 6-OHDA, and that GADD34 localization is dramatically altered in dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons in PD cases. We further demonstrated that guanabenz attenuates 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced cell death of differentiated PC12 cells and primary ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons in culture, and of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of mice. In culture models, guanabenz also increases eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 and parkin levels in response to 6-OHDA. Furthermore, if either ATF4 or parkin is silenced, then the protective effect of guanabenz is lost. We also found similar results in a distinct model of neuronal death: primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, in which guanabenz limited camptothecin-induced neuronal death in an ATF4- and parkin-dependent manner.

development and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with aberrant regulation/induction of cell cycle proteins. However, the proximal events in this process are unknown. Cell cycle initiation requires dephosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases by cell division cycle 25A (Cdc25A). Here, we show that Cdc25A is essential for neuronal death in response to NGF deprivation or \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) treatment and describe the mechanisms by which it is regulated in these paradigms. Cdc25A mRNA, protein and Cdc25A phosphatase activity were induced by NGF deprivation and A\u03b2 treatment. Enhanced Cdc25A expression was also observed in rat brains infused with A\u03b2 and in A\u03b2-overexpressing A\u03b2PPswe-PS1dE9 mice. In cultured neurons Cdc25A inhibition by chemical inhibitors or shRNA prevented cell death and neurite degeneration caused by NGF deprivation or A\u03b2. Additionally, Cdc25A inhibition diminished distal signaling events including Cdk-dependent elevation of phospho-pRb and subsequent caspase-3 activation. Mechanism studies revealed that Cdc25A induction by NGF deprivation and A\u03b2 is mediated by activation of Forkhead transcription factors that in turn suppress miR-21, a negative regulator of Cdc25A. Our studies thus identify Cdc25A as a required upstream element of the apoptotic cell cycle pathway that is required for neuron death in response to trophic factor deprivation and to A\u03b2 exposure and therefore as a potential target to suppress pathologic neuron death.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nandini", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology and Physiology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology , 4 Raja S.

Here, we find that ATF4 down-regulation in both hippocampal and cortical neuron cultures reduces protein and message levels of RhoGDI\u03b1, a stabilizer of the Rho GTPases including Cdc42. This effect is rescued by an shATF4-resistant active form of ATF4, but not by a mutant that lacks transcriptional activity.

This pathway is not restricted to neurons. This is seen in an impairment of cell migration on ATF4 reduction in non-neuronal cells.

Trib3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3) is a stress-induced gene with proapoptotic activity that was previously described as highly activated at the transcriptional level in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) cellular model of PD. Here, we report that Trib3 immunostaining is elevated in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of human PD patients. Trib3 protein is also upregulated in cellular models of PD, including neuronal PC12 cells and rat dopaminergic ventral midbrain neurons treated with 6-OHDA, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), or \u03b1-synuclein fibrils (\u03b1SYN). In the toxin models, Trib3 induction is substantially mediated by the transcription factors CHOP and ATF4. Trib3 overexpression is sufficient to promote neuronal death; conversely, Trib3 knockdown protects neuronal PC12 cells as well as ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons from 6-OHDA, MPP+, or \u03b1SYN. Mechanism studies revealed that Trib3 physically interacts with Parkin, a prosurvival protein whose loss of function is associated with PD. Elevated Trib3 reduces Parkin expression in cultured cells; and in the SNpc of PD patients, Parkin levels are reduced in a subset of dopaminergic neurons expressing high levels of Trib3. Loss of Parkin at least partially mediates the prodeath actions of Trib3 in that Parkin knockdown in cellular PD models abolishes the protective effect of Trib3 downregulation.

However, the potential cellular bases for these and other actions of ATF4 in brain are not well-defined. In this report, we focus on ATF4's role in post-synaptic synapse development and dendritic spine morphology. shRNA-mediated silencing of ATF4 significantly reduces the densities of PSD-95 and GluR1 puncta (presumed markers of excitatory synapses) in long-term cultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons. ATF4 knockdown also decreases the density of mushroom spines and increases formation of abnormally-long dendritic filopodia in such cultures. In vivo knockdown of ATF4 in adult mouse hippocampal neurons also reduces mushroom spine density. In contrast, ATF4 over-expression does not affect the densities of PSD-95 puncta or mushrooom spines. Regulation of synaptic puncta and spine densities by ATF4 requires its transcriptional activity and is mediated at least in part by indirectly controlling the stability and expression of the total and active forms of the actin regulatory protein Cdc42. In support of such a mechanism, ATF4 silencing decreases the half-life of Cdc42 in cultured cortical neurons from 31.5 to 18.5 h while knockdown of Cdc42, like ATF4 knockdown, reduces the densities of mushroom spines and PSD-95 puncta.

In the present study, using two different neuronal apoptotic paradigms, \u03b2-amyloid treatment and NGF (nerve growth factor) withdrawal, we examined the hierarchical role of caspase-2 activation in the transcriptional control of neuron death. Both paradigms induce rapid activation of caspase-2 as well as activation of the transcription factor c-Jun and subsequent induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3 (Bcl-homology domain 3)-only protein Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death). Caspase-2 activation is dependent on the adaptor protein RAIDD {RIP (receptor-interacting protein)-associated ICH-1 [ICE (interleukin-1\u03b2-converting enzyme)/CED-3 (cell-death determining 3) homologue 1] protein with a death domain}, and both caspase-2 and RAIDD are required for c-Jun activation and Bim induction.

The transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) is induced by multiple PD-relevant stressors, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative damage. ATF4 may exert either protective or deleterious effects on cell survival, depending on the paradigm. However, the role of ATF4 in the pathogenesis of PD has not been explored. We find that ATF4 levels are increased in neuromelanin-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of a subset of PD patients relative to controls. ATF4 levels are also upregulated in neuronal PC12 cells treated with the dopaminergic neuronal toxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). To explore the role of ATF4 in cell survival in PD-relevant contexts, we either silenced or overexpressed ATF4 in cellular models of PD. In neuronal PC12 cells, silencing of ATF4 enhanced cell death in response to either 6-OHDA or MPP+. Conversely, overexpression of ATF4 reduced cell death caused by dopaminergic neuronal toxins. ATF4 was also protective against 6-OHDA-induced death of cultured mouse ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We further show that parkin, a gene associated with autosomal recessive PD, plays a critical role in ATF4-mediated protection. After treatment with 6-OHDA or MPP+, parkin protein levels fall, despite an increase in mRNA levels. ATF4 silencing exacerbates the toxin-induced reduction of parkin, whereas ATF4 overexpression partially preserves parkin levels. Finally, parkin silencing blocked the protective capacity of ATF4. These results indicate that ATF4 plays a protective role in PD through the regulation of parkin.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Animals", "Cell Death", "Cells, Cultured", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "PC12 Cells", "Parkinson Disease", "Rats", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaotian", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Crary", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Malagelada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oren A", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Feb06"}]
