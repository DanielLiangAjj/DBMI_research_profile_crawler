However, the application of causal fairness notions in evaluating the fairness of clinical decision-making with electronic health record (EHR) data remains an understudied domain.

A common technique is to check whether the standardized mean difference for each relevant covariate is less than a threshold like 0.1. For small sample sizes, the probability of falsely rejecting the validity of a study because of chance imbalance when no underlying balance exists approaches 1. We propose an alternative diagnostic that checks whether the standardized mean difference statistically significantly exceeds the threshold. Through simulation and real-world data, we find that this diagnostic achieves a better trade-off of type 1 error rate and power than standard nominal threshold tests and not testing for sample sizes from 250 to 4000 and for 20 to 100,000 covariates. In network studies, meta-analysis of effect estimates must be accompanied by meta-analysis of the diagnostics or else systematic confounding may overwhelm the estimated effect. Our procedure for statistically testing balance at both the database level and the meta-analysis level achieves the best balance of type-1 error rate and power.

"Data-driven clinical prediction algorithms are used widely by clinicians. Understanding what factors can impact the performance and fairness of data-driven algorithms is an important step towards achieving equitable healthcare. To investigate the impact of modeling choices on the algorithmic performance and fairness, we make use of a case study to build a prediction algorithm for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on the patient's electronic health record (EHR). We compare three distinct approaches for estimating GFR: CKD-EPI equations, epidemiological models, and EHR-based models. For epidemiological models and EHR-based models, four machine learning models of varying computational complexity (i.e., linear regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, and neural network) were compared. Performance metrics included root mean squared error (RMSE), median difference, and the proportion of GFR estimates within 30% of the measured GFR value (P30). Differential performance between non-African American and African American group was used to assess algorithmic fairness with respect to race. Our study showed that the variable race had a negligible effect on error, accuracy, and differential performance. Furthermore, including more relevant clinical features (e.g., common comorbidities of chronic kidney disease) and using more complex machine learning models, namely random forest regression, significantly lowered the estimation error of GFR. However, the difference in performance between African American and non-African American patients did not decrease, where the estimation error for African American patients remained consistently higher than non-African American patients, indicating that more objective patient characteristics should be discovered and included to improve algorithm performance.", "Keywords": ["algorithmic fairness", "electronic health record", "glomerular filtration rate", "machine learning", "predictive modeling"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren R", "Last Name": "Richter", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tevin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jan09"}, {"PMID": "38222429", "Title": "Standardizing Multi-site Clinical Note Titles to LOINC Document Ontology: A Transformer-based Approach.", "Abstract": "The types of clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs) are diverse and it would be great to standardize them to ensure unified data retrieval, exchange, and integration. The LOINC Document Ontology (DO) is a subset of LOINC that is created specifically for naming and describing clinical documents.

In this study we evaluated the utility of LOINC DO by mapping clinical note titles collected from five institutions to the LOINC DO and classifying the mapping into three classes based on semantic similarity between note titles and LOINC DO codes. Additionally, we developed a standardization pipeline that automatically maps clinical note titles from multiple sites to suitable LOINC DO codes, without accessing the content of clinical notes. The pipeline can be initialized with different large language models, and we compared the performances between them. The results showed that our automated pipeline achieved an accuracy of 0.90.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and COL4A-associated nephropathy (COL4A-AN) represent the most common forms of monogenic kidney diseases. These disorders have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and we hypothesize that polygenic factors explain some of this variability. By combining SNP array, exome/genome sequence, and electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and All-of-Us cohorts, we demonstrate that the genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) significantly predicts CKD among ADPKD monogenic variant carriers. Compared to the middle tertile of the GPS for noncarriers, ADPKD variant carriers in the top tertile have a 54-fold increased risk of CKD, while ADPKD variant carriers in the bottom tertile have only a 3-fold increased risk of CKD. Similarly, the GPS significantly predicts CKD in COL4A-AN carriers. The carriers in the top tertile of the GPS have a 2.5-fold higher risk of CKD, while the risk for carriers in the bottom tertile is not different from the average population risk.

Typically relying on sequential analysis of real-world health data as they accrue, safety surveillance is challenged by sequential multiple testing and by biases induced by residual confounding in observational data. The current standard approach based on the maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) fails to satisfactorily address these practical challenges and it remains a rigid framework that requires prespecification of the surveillance schedule. We develop an alternative Bayesian surveillance procedure that addresses both aforementioned challenges using a more flexible framework. To mitigate bias, we jointly analyze a large set of negative control outcomes that are adverse events with no known association with the vaccines in order to inform an empirical bias distribution, which we then incorporate into estimating the effect of vaccine exposure on the adverse event of interest through a Bayesian hierarchical model. To address multiple testing and improve on flexibility, at each analysis timepoint, we update a posterior probability in favor of the alternative hypothesis that vaccination induces higher risks of adverse events, and then use it for sequential detection of safety signals. Through an empirical evaluation using six US observational healthcare databases covering more than 360 million patients, we benchmark the proposed procedure against MaxSPRT on testing errors and estimation accuracy, under two epidemiological designs, the historical comparator and the self-controlled case series. We demonstrate that our procedure substantially reduces Type 1 error rates, maintains high statistical power and fast signal detection, and provides considerably more accurate estimation than MaxSPRT.

We assessed representation of blind and deaf people in the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) 2018-2023 cohort of participants who provided electronic health records and compared it with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018 national estimates by key demographic characteristics and intersections thereof. Blind and deaf AoURP participants are considerably underrepresented in the cohort, especially among working-age adults (younger than age 65\u2009years), as well as Asian and multi-racial participants. Analyses show compounded underrepresentation at the intersection of multiple marginalization (that is, racial or ethnic minoritized group, female sex, low education and low income), most substantively for working-age blind participants identifying as Black or African American female with education levels lower than high school (representing one-fifth of their national prevalence).

However, mapping EHR data to OBO ontologies requires significant manual curation and domain expertise. We introduce OMOP2OBO, an algorithm for mapping Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabularies to OBO ontologies. Using OMOP2OBO, we produced mappings for 92,367 conditions, 8611 drug ingredients, and 10,673 measurement results, which covered 68-99% of concepts used in clinical practice when examined across 24 hospitals. When used to phenotype rare disease patients, the mappings helped systematically identify undiagnosed patients who might benefit from genetic testing.

"Abstract": "Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP solutions in real-world studies.", "Keywords": ["Electronic health records", "Natural language processing", "Real-world study"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Data Science", "Electronic Health Records", "Medical Informatics", "Natural Language Processing", "Narration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vipina K", "Last Name": "Keloth", "Affiliation": "Section of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan M", "Last Name": "Banda", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Gurley", "Affiliation": "Lurie Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Heider", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Georgina", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Hongfang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Feifan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karthik", "Last Name": "Natarajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "V Patterson", "Affiliation": "VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, Department of Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA;

The aim of the study is to provide a large-scale characterization of COVID-19 patients with COPD. Methods: We included thirteen databases contributing data from January-June 2020 from North America (US), Europe and Asia. We defined two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 namely a 'diagnosed' and 'hospitalized' cohort. We followed patients from COVID-19 index date to 30 days or death. We performed descriptive analysis and reported the frequency of characteristics and outcomes among COPD patients with COVID-19. Results: The study included 934,778 patients in the diagnosed COVID-19 cohort and 177,201 in the hospitalized COVID-19 cohort. Observed COPD prevalence in the diagnosed cohort ranged from 3.8% (95%CI 3.5-4.1%) in French data to 22.7% (95%CI 22.4-23.0) in US data, and from 1.9% (95%CI 1.6-2.2) in South Korean to 44.0% (95%CI 43.1-45.0) in US data, in the hospitalized cohorts. COPD patients in the hospitalized cohort had greater comorbidity than those in the diagnosed cohort, including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Mortality was higher in COPD patients in the hospitalized cohort and ranged from 7.6% (95%CI 6.9-8.4) to 32.2% (95%CI 28.0-36.7) across databases. ARDS, acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia and sepsis were the most common outcomes among hospitalized COPD patients. \u00a0 Conclusion: COPD patients with COVID-19 have high levels of COVID-19-associated comorbidities and poor COVID-19 outcomes.

The human lung-ventilator system (LVS) involves the interaction of complex anatomy with a mechanical apparatus, which limits the ability of process-based models to provide individualized clinical support. This work proposes a hypothesis-driven strategy for LVS modeling in which robust personalization is achieved using a pre-defined parameter basis in a non-physiological model. Model inversion, here via windowed data assimilation, forges observed waveforms into interpretable parameter values that characterize the data rather than quantifying physiological processes. Accurate, model-based inference on human-ventilator data indicates model flexibility and utility over a variety of breath types, including those from dyssynchronous LVSs. Estimated parameters generate static characterizations of the data that are 50%-70% more accurate than breath-wise single-compartment model estimates. They also retain sufficient information to distinguish between the types of breath they represent. However, the fidelity and interpretability of model characterizations are tied to parameter definitions and model resolution. These additional factors must be considered in conjunction with the objectives of specific applications, such as identifying and tracking the development of human VILI.", "Keywords": ["Biomedical informatics", "Data assimilation", "Health information management", "Kalman filters", "Mathematical model", "Parameter estimation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Ventilators, Mechanical", "Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury", "Lung"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J N", "Last Name": "Stroh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA; Department of Bioengineering, University of Colorado, Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.

Adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes have a more aggressive disease compared to adults, with a rapid decline in pancreatic \u03b2 cell function and increased incidence of comorbidities. Given the relative paucity of pharmacotherapies, bariatric surgery has become increasingly used as a therapeutic option. However, subsets of this population have sub-optimal outcomes with either inadequate weight loss or little improvement in disease. Predicting which patients will benefit from surgery is a difficult task and detailed physiological characteristics of patients who do not respond to treatment are generally unknown. Identifying physiological predictors of surgical response therefore has the potential to reveal both novel phenotypes of disease as well as therapeutic targets. We leverage data assimilation paired with mechanistic models of glucose metabolism to estimate pre-operative physiological states of bariatric surgery patients, thereby identifying latent phenotypes of impaired glucose metabolism. Specifically, maximal insulin secretion capacity, \u03c3, and insulin sensitivity, SI, differentiate aberrations in glucose metabolism underlying an individual's disease. Using multivariable logistic regression, we combine clinical data with data assimilation to predict post-operative glycemic outcomes at 12\u00a0months. Models using data assimilation sans insulin had comparable performance to models using oral glucose tolerance test glucose and insulin. Our best performing models used data assimilation and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.7665, 0.7734) and mean average precision of 0.6258 (0.6206, 0.6311). We show that data assimilation extracts knowledge from mechanistic models of glucose metabolism to infer future glycemic states from limited clinical data. This method can provide a pathway to predict long-term, post-surgical glycemic states by estimating the contributions of insulin resistance and limitations of insulin secretion to pre-operative glucose metabolism.", "Keywords": ["bariatric surgery", "data assimilation", "machine learning", "mechanistic models of glucose metabolism", "obesity", "pediatrics", "type 2 diabetes"], "MeSH terms":

susceptibility to mucosal pathogens, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IgA nephropathy. We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals",

cytokine storm release. The proposed treatment based on this hypothesis currently lacks support from reliable real-world evidence, however. We leverage an international network of large-scale healthcare databases to generate comprehensive evidence in a transparent and reproducible manner. Methods: In this international cohort study, we deployed electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, IQVIA OpenClaims, Optum DOD, Optum EHR). We assessed association between alpha-1 blocker use and risks of three COVID-19 outcomes-diagnosis, hospitalization, and hospitalization requiring intensive services-using a prevalent-user active-comparator design. We estimated hazard ratios using state-of-the-art techniques to minimize potential confounding, including large-scale propensity score matching/stratification and negative control calibration. We pooled database-specific estimates through random effects meta-analysis. Results: Our study overall included 2.6 and 0.46 million users of alpha-1 blockers and of alternative BPH medications. We observed no significant difference in their risks for any of the COVID-19 outcomes, with our meta-analytic HR estimates being 1.02 (95% CI: 0.92-1.13) for diagnosis, 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89-1.13) for hospitalization, and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.71-1.88) for hospitalization requiring intensive services.

We address two questions. First, what is the nature of the DIU phenotype? That is, what physiological macrostates (as encoded by physiological parameters) allow for DIU onset? Second, how does DIU impact health? We find that the DIU phenotype is abundant in the space of intrinsic parameters for the Ultradian glucose-insulin model-a model that has been successfully used to predict glucose-insulin dynamics in humans. Configurations of intrinsic parameters that correspond to high characteristic glucose levels facilitate DIU onset.

This problem is paramount in medicine, where we would like to answer causal questions from large observational datasets like electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims. Modern medical data typically contain tens of thousands of covariates. Such a large set carries hope that many of the confounders are directly measured, and further hope that others are indirectly measured through their correlation with measured covariates. How can we exploit these large sets of covariates for causal inference? To help answer this question, this paper examines the performance of the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach on causal analysis of medical data.

Collected Healthcare Data-An Empirical Evaluation of Epidemiological Designs.", "Abstract": "Background: Routinely collected healthcare data such as administrative claims and electronic health records (EHR) can complement clinical trials and spontaneous reports to detect previously unknown risks of vaccines, but uncertainty remains about the behavior of alternative epidemiologic designs to detect and declare a true risk early. Methods: Using three claims and one EHR database, we evaluate several variants of the case-control, comparative cohort, historical comparator, and self-controlled designs against historical vaccinations using real negative control outcomes (outcomes with no evidence to suggest that they could be caused by the vaccines) and simulated positive control outcomes. Results: Most methods show large type 1 error, often identifying false positive signals. The cohort method appears either positively or negatively biased, depending on the choice of comparator index date. Empirical calibration using effect-size estimates for negative control outcomes can bring type 1 error closer to nominal, often at the cost of increasing type 2 error. After calibration, the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design most rapidly detects small true effect sizes, while the historical comparator performs well for strong effects. Conclusion: When applying any method for vaccine safety surveillance we recommend considering the potential for systematic error, especially due to confounding, which for many designs appears to be substantial. Adjusting for age and sex alone is likely not sufficient to address differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and for the cohort method the choice of index date is important for the comparability of the groups. Analysis of negative control outcomes allows both quantification of the systematic error and, if desired, subsequent empirical calibration to restore type 1 error to its nominal value. In order to detect weaker signals, one may have to accept a higher type 1 error.", "Keywords": ["adverse event", "methods", "routinely collected data", "surveillance", "vaccine safety"], "MeSH terms":

Across an International Network of Observational Databases.", "Abstract": "Objective: Background incidence rates are routinely used in safety studies to evaluate an association of an exposure and outcome. Systematic research on sensitivity of rates to the choice of the study parameters is lacking. Materials and Methods: We used 12 data sources to systematically examine the influence of age, race, sex, database, time-at-risk, season and year, prior observation and clean window on incidence rates using 15 adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines as an example. For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect meta-analysis. Results: We observed a wide variation of background rates that goes well beyond age and database effects previously observed. While rates vary up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups, even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Rates were highly influenced by the choice of anchoring (e.g., health visit, vaccination, or arbitrary date) for the time-at-risk start. Anchoring on a healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence comparing to a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. Incidence rates were highly influenced by the choice of the database (varying by up to a factor of 100), clean window choice and time-at-risk duration, and less so by secular or seasonal trends. Conclusion: Comparing background to observed rates requires appropriate adjustment and careful time-at-risk start and duration choice. Results should be interpreted in the context of study parameter choices.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "adverse events", "background rates", "incidence rates", "sensitivity analysis", "vaccine"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Ostropolets", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xintong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Rupa", "Last Name": "Makadia", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, Titusville, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gowtham", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, Titusville, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter R", "Last Name": "Rijnbeek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Talita", "Last Name": "Duarte-Salles", "Affiliation": "Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la Recerca a L'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Anthony G", "Last Name": "Sena", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, Titusville, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Azza", "Last Name": "Shaoibi", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, Titusville, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick B", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Prieto-Alhambra", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35482996", "Title": "Characterizing Anchoring Bias in Vaccine Comparator Selection Due to Health Care Utilization With COVID-19 and Influenza: Observational Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Observational data enables large-scale vaccine safety surveillance but requires careful evaluation of the potential sources of bias.

Whether certain methods of surveillance are more precise and unbiased in generating safety signals is unclear. Here, we synthesized information from existing literature to provide an overview of the strengths, weaknesses, and clinical applications of epidemiologic and analytical methods used in vaccine monitoring, focusing on cohort, case-control and self-controlled designs. These designs are proposed to be evaluated in the EUMAEUS (Evaluating Use of Methods for Adverse Event Under Surveillance-for vaccines) study because of their widespread use and potential utility. Over the past decades, there have been an increasing number of epidemiological study designs used for vaccine safety surveillance. While traditional cohort and case-control study designs remain widely used, newer, novel designs such as the self-controlled case series and self-controlled risk intervals have been developed. Each study design comes with its strengths and limitations, and the most appropriate study design will depend on availability of resources, access to records, number and distribution of cases, and availability of population coverage data. Several assumptions have to be made while using the various study designs, and while the goal is to mitigate any biases, violations of these assumptions are often still present to varying degrees. In our review, we discussed some of the potential biases (i.e., selection bias, misclassification bias and confounding bias), and ways to mitigate them. While the types of epidemiological study designs are well established, a comprehensive comparison of the analytical aspects (including method evaluation and performance metrics) of these study designs are relatively less well studied. We summarized the literature, reporting on two simulation studies, which compared the detection time, empirical power, error rate and risk estimate bias across the above-mentioned study designs. While these simulation studies provided insights on the analytic performance of each of the study designs, its applicability to real-world data remains unclear. To bridge that gap, we provided the rationale of the EUMAEUS study, with a brief description of the study design; and how the use of real-world multi-database networks can provide insights into better methods evaluation and vaccine safety surveillance.", "Keywords": ["bias", "methods evaluation", "real-world data", "study design", "vaccine safety surveillance"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lana Yh", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Faaizah", "Last Name": "Arshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Areia", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Thamir M", "Last Name": "Alshammari", "Affiliation": "Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Heba", "Last Name": "Alghoul", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Islamic University of Gaza, Gaza, Palestine."}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Casajust", "Affiliation": "Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Xintong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Dalia", "Last Name": "Dawoud", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Fredrik", "Last Name": "Nyberg", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Pratt", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Prieto-Alhambra", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Martijn J", "Last Name": "Schuemie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35345821", "Title": "Unraveling COVID-19: A Large-Scale Characterization of 4.5 Million COVID-19 Cases Using CHARYBDIS.", "Abstract": "Routinely collected real world data (RWD) have great utility in aiding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response.

The aim of the study was to perform a large-scale descriptive characterization of COVID-19 patients with asthma.Methods: We included nine databases contributing data from January to June 2020 from the US, South Korea (KR), Spain, UK and the Netherlands. We defined two cohorts of COVID-19 patients ('diagnosed' and 'hospitalized') based on COVID-19 disease codes. We followed patients from COVID-19 index date to 30\u2009days or death. We performed descriptive analysis and reported the frequency of characteristics and outcomes in people with asthma defined by codes and prescriptions.Results: The diagnosed and hospitalized cohorts contained 666,933 and 159,552 COVID-19 patients respectively. Exacerbation in people with asthma was recorded in 1.6-8.6% of patients at presentation. Asthma prevalence ranged from 6.2% (95% CI 5.7-6.8) to 18.5% (95% CI 18.2-18.8) in the diagnosed cohort and 5.2% (95% CI 4.0-6.8) to 20.5% (95% CI 18.6-22.6) in the hospitalized cohort. Asthma patients with COVID-19 had high prevalence of comorbidity including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Mortality ranged from 2.1% (95% CI 1.8-2.4) to 16.9% (95% CI 13.8-20.5) and similar or lower compared to COVID-19 patients without asthma. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 15-30% of hospitalized COVID-19 asthma patients.Conclusion: The prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients varies internationally. Asthma patients with COVID-19 have high comorbidity. The prevalence of asthma exacerbation at presentation was low. Whilst mortality was similar among COVID-19 patients with and without asthma, this could be confounded by differences in clinical characteristics. Further research could help identify high-risk asthma patients.[Box: see text]Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.2025392 .", "Keywords":

quantify bias, precision and timeliness of different study designs to estimate historical background (expected) compared to post-vaccination (observed) rates of safety events for several vaccines. We used negative (not causally related) and positive control outcomes. The latter were synthetically generated true safety signals with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4. Observed vs. expected analysis using within-database historical background rates is a sensitive but unspecific method for the identification of potential vaccine safety signals. Despite good discrimination, most analyses showed a tendency to overestimate risks, with 20%-100% type 1 error, but low (0% to 20%) type 2 error in the large databases included in our study. Efforts to improve the comparability of background and post-vaccine rates, including age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rates around a visit, reduced type 1 error and improved precision but residual systematic error persisted. Additionally, empirical calibration dramatically reduced type 1 to nominal but came at the cost of increasing type 2 error.", "Keywords": ["background rate", "empirical - comparison", "incidence rate", "real world data", "vaccine safety"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xintong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Lana Yh", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Ostropolets", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Faaizah", "Last Name": "Arshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eng Hooi", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Casajust", "Affiliation": "Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Thamir M", "Last Name": "Alshammari", "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Riyadh Elm University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Talita", "Last Name": "Duarte-Salles", "Affiliation": "Institut Universitari D'Investigaci\u00f3 en Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Jordi Gol (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Evan P", "Last Name": "Minty", "Affiliation": "O'Brien Institute for Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Areia", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Pratt", "Affiliation": "Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre, Clinical and Health Sciences, University of South Australia, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Patrick B", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, United States."}, {"First Name": "Martijn J", "Last Name": "Schuemie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Prieto-Alhambra", "Affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34543225", "Title": "Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research: Database Analysis.", "Abstract": "COVID-19 has threatened the health of tens of millions of people all over the world.

A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6-14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28-52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support.

We first developed an annotation framework based on the definition of LOINC DO axes and manually mapped 4,000 titles. Then we introduced a pre-trained deep learning model named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to enable automatic mapping from titles to LOINC DO axes.

We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin.

We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls. Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone.

unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results.

Here we present the international Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) [3] Characterizing Health Associated Risks, and Your Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2 (CHARYBDIS) framework for standardisation and analysis of COVID-19 RWD. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cohort study using a federated network of data partners in the United States, Europe (the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany, France and Italy) and Asia (South Korea and China). The study protocol and analytical package were released on 11 th June 2020 and are iteratively updated via GitHub [4]. Findings: We identified three non-mutually exclusive cohorts of 4,537,153 individuals with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test, 886,193 hospitalized with COVID-19 , and 113,627 hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring intensive services . All comorbidities, symptoms, medications, and outcomes are described by cohort in aggregate counts, and are available in an interactive website: https://data.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/. Interpretation: CHARYBDIS findings provide benchmarks that contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 progression, management and evolution over time.

system are predictable. We demonstrate that delay within the glucose-insulin system can induce sustained temporal chaos, rendering the system unpredictable. Specifically, we exhibit such chaos for the ultradian glucose-insulin model. This well-validated, finite-dimensional model represents feedback delay as a three-stage filter. Using the theory of rank one maps from smooth dynamical systems, we precisely explain the nature of the resulting delay-induced uncertainty (DIU). We develop a framework one may use to diagnose DIU in a general oscillatory dynamical system. For infinite-dimensional delay systems, no analog of the theory of rank one maps exists. Nevertheless, we show that the geometric principles encoded in our DIU framework apply to such systems by exhibiting sustained temporal chaos for a linear shear flow.

That same year, AMIA's Policy Meeting focused on possible unintended consequences associated with rapid implementation of electronic health records, generating 17 potential consequences and 15 recommendations to address them. At the 2020 annual meeting of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), ACMI fellows participated in a modified Delphi process to assess the accuracy of the 2009 predictions and the response to the recommendations.

However, limited prior studies raise concerns about the real-world performance of the statistical and epidemiological methods that are used. We present the \"OHDSI Methods Benchmark\" that aims to evaluate the performance of effect estimation methods on real data. The benchmark comprises a gold standard, a set of metrics, and a set of open source software tools. The gold standard is a collection of real negative controls (drug-outcome pairs where no causal effect appears to exist) and synthetic positive controls (drug-outcome pairs that augment negative controls with simulated causal effects). We apply the benchmark using four large healthcare databases to evaluate methods commonly used in practice: the new-user cohort, self-controlled cohort, case-control, case-crossover, and self-controlled case series designs. The results confirm the concerns about these methods, showing that for most methods the operating characteristics deviate considerably from nominal levels. For example, in most contexts, only half of the 95% confidence intervals we calculated contain the corresponding true effect size. We previously developed an \"empirical calibration\" procedure to restore these characteristics and we also evaluate this procedure. While no one method dominates, self-controlled methods such as the empirically calibrated self-controlled case series perform well across a wide range of scenarios.", "Keywords": ["causal effect estimation", "evaluation", "methods", "observational research"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martijn J", "Last Name": "Schuemie", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "M Soledad", "Last Name": "Cepeda", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "Jianxiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "Yuxi", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Schuler", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "Patrick B", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Madigan", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics."}], "Journal": "Harvard data science review", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33342753", "Title": "Renin-angiotensin system blockers and susceptibility to COVID-19: an international, open science, cohort analysis.", "Abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated to affect susceptibility to COVID-19.

Secondly, to describe health outcomes amongst children/adolescents diagnosed with previous seasonal influenza. Design International network cohort. Setting Real-world data from European primary care records (France/Germany/Spain), South Korean claims and US claims and hospital databases. Participants Diagnosed and/or hospitalized children/adolescents with COVID-19 at age <18 between January and June 2020; diagnosed with influenza in 2017-2018. Main outcome measures Baseline demographics and comorbidities, symptoms, 30-day in-hospital treatments and outcomes including hospitalization, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and death. Results A total of 55,270 children/adolescents diagnosed and 3,693 hospitalized with COVID-19 and 1,952,693 diagnosed with influenza were studied. Comorbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders, heart disease, and cancer were all more common among those hospitalized vs diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common COVID-19 symptom was fever. Dyspnea, bronchiolitis, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in COVID-19 than influenza. In-hospital treatments for COVID-19 included repurposed medications (<10%), and adjunctive therapies: systemic corticosteroids (6.8% to 37.6%), famotidine (9.0% to 28.1%), and antithrombotics such as aspirin (2.0% to 21.4%), heparin (2.2% to 18.1%), and enoxaparin (2.8% to 14.8%). Hospitalization was observed in 0.3% to 1.3% of the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort, with undetectable (N<5 per database) 30-day fatality. Thirty-day outcomes including pneumonia, ARDS, and MIS-C were more frequent in COVID-19 than influenza. Conclusions Despite negligible fatality, complications including pneumonia, ARDS and MIS-C were more frequent in children/adolescents with COVID-19 than with influenza. Dyspnea, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differential diagnosis.

However, many claim such data cannot be used to estimate causal treatment effects because of the potential for observational study bias; for example, due to residual confounding. Other concerns include P hacking and publication bias. In response, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics international collaborative launched the Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND) research initiative. Its mission is to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases while addressing the aforementioned concerns by following a recently proposed paradigm. We define 10 principles of LEGEND that enshrine this new paradigm, prescribing the generation and dissemination of evidence on many research questions at once; for example, comparing all treatments for a disease for many outcomes, thus preventing publication bias. These questions are answered using a prespecified and systematic approach, avoiding P hacking. Best-practice statistical methods address measured confounding, and control questions (research questions where the answer is known) quantify potential residual bias.

However, there is a lack of head-to-head comparative effectiveness studies comparing the two treatments. We conducted a retrospective large-scale multicenter study encompassing over 300 million patients across nine databases encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The primary outcome was the incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture, while secondary outcomes were vertebral fracture, atypical femoral fracture (AFF), osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and esophageal cancer. We used propensity score trimming and stratification based on an expansive propensity score model with all pre-treatment patient characteritistcs. We accounted for unmeasured confounding using negative control outcomes to estimate and adjust for residual systematic bias in each data source. We identified 283,586 alendronate patients and 40,463 raloxifene patients. There were 7.48 hip fracture, 8.18 vertebral fracture, 1.14 AFF, 0.21 esophageal cancer and 0.09 ONJ events per 1,000 person-years in the alendronate cohort and 6.62, 7.36, 0.69, 0.22 and 0.06 events per 1,000 person-years, respectively, in the raloxifene cohort. Alendronate and raloxifene have a similar hip fracture risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.13), but alendronate users are more likely to have vertebral fractures (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14). Alendronate has higher risk for AFF (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23-1.84) but similar risk for esophageal cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.53-1.70), and ONJ (HR 1.62, 95% CI 0.78-3.34). We demonstrated substantial control of measured confounding by propensity score adjustment, and minimal residual systematic bias through negative control experiments, lending credibility to our effect estimates. Raloxifene is as effective as alendronate and may remain an option in the prevention of osteoporotic fracture.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alendronate", "Bone Density", "Bone Density Conservation Agents", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporosis", "Raloxifene Hydrochloride", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yeesuk", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, 04763, Republic of Korea. estone96@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Yuxi", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianxiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vojtech", "Last Name": "Huser", "Affiliation": "Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, 20894, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christophe G", "Last Name": "Lambert", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hojun", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seng Chan", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Rae Woong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Peter R", "Last Name": "Rijnbeek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3000, Rotterdam, CA, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Mui", "Last Name": "Van Zandt", "Affiliation": "Real World Insights, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Reich", "Affiliation": "Real World Insights, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rohit", "Last Name": "Vashisht", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yonghui", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jon", "Last Name": "Duke", "Affiliation": "Center for Health Analytics and Informatics, Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Madigan", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nigam H", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick B", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Analytics, Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, 08560, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martijn J", "Last Name": "Schuemie", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Analytics, Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, 08560, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Jul06"}, {"PMID": "32587982", "Title": "Renin-angiotensin system blockers and susceptibility to COVID-19: a multinational open science cohort study.", "Abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could influence infection risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with 81,596 influenza patients in America, Europe and Asia: an international network study.", "Abstract": "Background In this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents. We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza. Methods We report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]). These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http://evidence.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization/). Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors":

However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disorder", "Data quality", "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)", "Phenotyping", "Portability", "Reproducibility"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Ostropolets", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Reich", "Affiliation": "IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA; Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research & Development, Raritan, NJ, USA; Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), New York, NY, USA.

Such regressions have an advantage of being useful with particularly sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan, that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation, to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right parameters to estimate.", "Keywords": ["Data assimilation", "Identifiability", "Inverse problems", "Machine learning", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Physiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Humans", "Insulin", "Machine Learning", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Models, Statistical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, 622 West 168th Street, PH-20, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Informatics, University of Colorado Medicine, Mail: F443, 13199 E.

However, results of these studies often cannot be replicated, and the advantage of this design over others is questionable. To demonstrate the shortcomings of applications of this design, we replicate two published case-control studies. The first investigates isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis using a simple case-control design. The second focuses on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis, using a nested case-control design. We include large sets of negative control exposures (where the true odds ratio is believed to be 1) in both studies. Both replication studies produce effect size estimates consistent with the original studies, but also generate estimates for the negative control exposures showing substantial residual bias. In contrast, applying a self-controlled design to answer the same questions using the same data reveals far less bias. Although the case-control design in general is not at fault, its application in retrospective database studies, where all exposure and covariate data for the entire cohort are available, is unnecessary, as other alternatives such as cohort and self-controlled designs are available. Moreover, by focusing on cases and controls it opens the door to inappropriate comparisons between exposure groups, leading to confounding for which the design has few options to adjust for. We argue that this design should no longer be used in these types of data. At the very least, negative control exposures should be used to prove that the concerns raised here do not apply.", "Keywords": ["case control", "database studies", "methods", "retrospective studies"], "MeSH terms": ["Bias", "Case-Control Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martijn J", "Last Name": "Schuemie", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Patrick B", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth K C", "Last Name": "Man", "Affiliation": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Ian C K", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Suchard", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Statistics in medicine", "PubDate": "2019Sep30"}, {"PMID": "31369862", "Title": "PheValuator: Development and evaluation of a phenotype algorithm evaluator.", "Abstract": "The primary approach for defining disease in observational healthcare databases is to construct phenotype algorithms (PAs), rule-based heuristics predicated on the presence, absence, and temporal logic of clinical observations.

As much as 70% of men over 70 will develop BPH. Few studies have been conducted to discover the genetic determinants of BPH risk. Understanding the biological basis for this condition may provide necessary insight for development of novel pharmaceutical therapies or risk prediction. We have evaluated SNP-based heritability of BPH in two cohorts and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BPH risk using 2,656 cases and 7,763 controls identified from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. SNP-based heritability estimates suggest that roughly 60% of the phenotypic variation in BPH is accounted for by genetic factors. We used logistic regression to model BPH risk as a function of principal components of ancestry, age, and imputed genotype data, with meta-analysis performed using METAL. The top result was on chromosome 22 in SYN3 at rs2710383 (p-value\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7; Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20090.55-0.83). Other suggestive signals were near genes GLGC, UNCA13, SORCS1 and between BTBD3 and SPTLC3. We also evaluated genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate tissue. The most significant result was with increasing predicted expression of ETV4 (chr17; p-value\u2009=\u20090.0015). Overexpression of this gene has been associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer. In conclusion, although there were no genome-wide significant variants identified for BPH susceptibility, we present evidence supporting the heritability of this phenotype, have identified suggestive signals, and evaluated the association between BPH and genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Electronic Health Records", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Prostate", "Prostatic Hyperplasia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jacklyn N", "Last Name": "Hellwege", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Stallings", "Affiliation": "Division of Geriatric Medicine, Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric S", "Last Name": "Torstenson", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carroll", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Borthwick", "Affiliation": "Hood Center for Health Research, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Murray H", "Last Name": "Brilliant", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Genetics, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Crosslin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gail P", "Last Name": "Jarvik", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Medical Genetics) and Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "James G", "Last Name": "Linneman", "Affiliation": "Office of Research Computing and Analytics/Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Parimala", "Last Name": "Devi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peggy L", "Last Name": "Peissig", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational and Biomedical Informatics, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick A M", "Last Name": "Sleiman", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hakon", "Last Name": "Hakonarson", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marylyn D", "Last Name": "Ritchie", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shefali Setia", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Josh C", "Last Name": "Denny", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan M", "Last Name": "Roden", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Digna R", "Last Name": "Velez Edwards", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. digna.r.velez.edwards@vumc.org."}, {"First Name": "Todd L", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. todd.l.edwards@vumc.org."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2019Apr15"}, {"PMID": "30815192", "Title": "Low Screening Rates for Diabetes Mellitus Among Family Members of Affected Relatives.", "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and abnormal blood glucose is an important risk factor.

We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time-series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations.

The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base.

As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10-16), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses.

We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified 7.4 million familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy.

to estimate effects of medical products at scale. Observational studies have often been found to be nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are exposure-outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of negative controls and used to calibrate P values, accounting for both random and systematic error. Here, we extend this work to calibration of confidence intervals (CIs). CIs require positive controls, which we synthesize by modifying negative controls. We show that our CI calibration restores nominal characteristics, such as 95% coverage of the true effect size by the 95% CI. We furthermore show that CI calibration reduces disagreement in replications of two pairs of conflicting observational studies: one related to dabigatran, warfarin, and gastrointestinal bleeding and one related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

To reduce such labeling efforts, we had proposed the application of active learning (AL) methods, introduced our CAESAR-ALE framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions, and shown its significant reduction of labeling efforts. The use of any of three AL methods (one well known [SVM-Margin], and two that we introduced [Exploitation and Combination_XA]) significantly reduced (by 48% to 64%) condition labeling efforts, compared to standard passive (random instance-selection) SVM learning. Furthermore, our new AL methods achieved maximal accuracy using 12% fewer labeled cases than the SVM-Margin AL method.

First, we wanted to know, based on the labelers' learning curves, whether using AL methods (versus standard passive learning methods) has an effect on the Intra-labeler variability (within the learning curve of each labeler) and inter-labeler variability (among the learning curves of different labelers).

Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Blood Glucose", "Computational Biology", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Male", "Patient-Specific Modeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Gluckman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Engineering Sciences and Mechanics, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lena", "Last Name": "Mamykina", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "28410982", "Title": "EHR-based phenotyping: Bulk learning and evaluation.", "Abstract": "In data-driven phenotyping, a core computational task is to identify medical concepts and their variations from sources of electronic health records (EHR) to stratify phenotypic cohorts.

In such a framework, tasks associated with feature engineering and data annotation remain a tedious and expensive exercise, resulting in poor scalability. In addition, certain clinical conditions, such as those that are rare and acute in nature, may never accumulate sufficient data over time, which poses a challenge to establishing accurate and informative statistical models.

We use a sparse annotation set to train and evaluate many phenotypes at once, which we call bulk learning. In this batch-phenotyping framework, disease cohort definitions can be learned from within the abstract feature space established by using multiple diseases as a substrate and diagnostic codes as surrogates. In particular, using surrogate labels for model training renders possible its subsequent evaluation using only a sparse annotated sample.

A significant proportion of medications that are widely prescribed for older adults are metabolized by enzymes that are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Pharmacogenetic testing is increasingly used to optimize the medication regimen; however, its potential in older adults with polypharmacy has not been systematically explored. Following the initial case-series study, this study hypothesized that frequently hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy have higher frequency of pharmacogenetic polymorphism as compared to older adults with polypharmacy who are rarely admitted to a hospital. To test this hypothesis, a nested case-control study was conducted with pharmacogenetic polymorphism as an exposure and hospitalization rate as an outcome. In this study, frequently hospitalized older adults (\u226565 years of age) with polypharmacy were matched with rarely hospitalized older adults with poly-pharmacy by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and chronic disease score. Average age and number of prescription drugs did not differ in cases and controls (77.2\u00b15.0 and 78.3\u00b15.1 years, 14.3\u00b15.3 and 14.0\u00b12.9 medications, respectively). No statistically significant difference in sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics that are known to affect hospitalization risk was found between the cases and controls. Major pharmacogenetic polymorphism defined as presence of at least one allelic combination resulting in poor or rapid metabolizer status was identified in all the cases. No major pharmacogenetic polymorphisms were detected in controls. Based on the exact McNemar's test, the difference in major pharmacogenetic polymorphism frequency between cases and controls was statistically significant (p<0.05). In 50% of cases, more than one major pharmacogenetic polymorphism was found. The frequency of CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, CYP3A4/5 poor metabolizer, VKORC1 low sensitivity, and CYP2D6 rapid metabolizer status in cases was 67%, 33%, 33%, and 17%, respectively, which significantly exceeded respective prevalence in general population. The mean number of major gene-drug interactions found in cases was 2.8\u00b12.2, whereas no major drug-gene interactions were identified in controls. The difference in the number of major drug-gene interactions between cases and controls was statistically significant (p<0.05). The pilot data supported the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic polymorphism may represent an independent risk factor for frequent hospitalizations in older adults with polypharmacy.

In this hypothesis-generating study, we employed a case series design to explore potential utility of PGx testing in older adults with polypharmacy and to highlight barriers in implementing this methodology in routine clinical practice. Three patients with concurrent chronic heart and lung disease aged 74, 78, and 83 years and whose medication regimen comprised 26, 17, and 18 drugs, correspondingly, served as cases for this study. PGx testing identified major genetic polymorphisms in the first two cases. The first case was identified as \"CYP3A4/CYP3A5 poor metabolizer\", which affected metabolism of eleven prescribed drugs. The second case had \"CYP2D6 rapid metabolizer\" status affecting three prescribed medications, two of which were key drugs for managing this patient's chronic conditions. Both these patients also had VKORC1 allele *A, resulting in higher sensitivity to warfarin. All cases demonstrated a significant number of potential drug-drug interactions. Both patients with significant drug-gene interactions had a history of frequent hospitalizations (six and 23, respectively), whereas the person without impaired cytochrome P450 enzyme activity had only two acute episodes in the last 5 years, although he was older and had multiple comorbidities. Since all patients received guideline-concordant therapy from the same providers and were adherent to their drug regimen, we hypothesized that genetic polymorphism may represent an additional risk factor for higher hospitalization rates in older adults with polypharmacy. However, evidence to support or reject this hypothesis is yet to be established. Studies evaluating clinical impact of PGx testing in older adults with polypharmacy are warranted. For practical implementation of pharmacogenomics in routine clinical care, besides providing convincing evidence of its clinical effectiveness, multiple barriers must be addressed. Introduction of intelligent clinical decision support in electronic medical record systems is required to address complexities of simultaneous drug-gene and drug-drug interactions in older adults with polypharmacy. Physician training, clear clinical pathways, evidence-based guidelines, and patient education materials are necessary for unlocking full potential of pharmacogenomics into routine clinical care of older adults.", "Keywords": ["case series", "elderly", "pharmacogenomics", "polypharmacy", "precision medicine"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Finkelstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carol", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Cabrera", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27064124", "Title": "Revealing structures in narratives: A mixed-methods approach to studying interdisciplinary handoff in critical care.", "Abstract": "To examine a novel mixed-methods approach for studying patterns of clinical communication that could inform future informatics solutions, with a specific focus on handoff within interdisciplinary teams.", "Keywords": ["Clinical communication", "Electronic documentation", "Handoff", "Shared mental models", "Teamwork"], "MeSH terms": ["Communication", "Continuity of Patient Care", "Critical Care", "Humans", "Narration", "Patient Handoff"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lena", "Last Name": "Mamykina", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, United States.

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent a rich source of labeled information that can be harnessed for severity classification. The labeling of EHRs is expensive and in many cases requires employing professionals with high level of expertise. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Active Learning (AL) techniques to decrease expert labeling efforts. We employ three AL methods and demonstrate their ability to reduce labeling efforts while effectively discriminating condition severity. We incorporate three AL methods into a new framework based on the original CAESAR (Classification Approach for Extracting Severity Automatically from Electronic Health Records) framework to create the Active Learning Enhancement framework (CAESAR-ALE). We applied CAESAR-ALE to a dataset containing 516 conditions of varying severity levels that were manually labeled by seven experts. Our dataset, called the \"CAESAR dataset,\" was created from the medical records of 1.9 million patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). All three AL methods decreased labelers' efforts compared to the learning methods applied by the original CAESER framework in which the classifier was trained on the entire set of conditions; depending on the AL strategy used in the current study, the reduction ranged from 48% to 64% that can result in significant savings, both in time and money. As for the PPV (precision) measure, CAESAR-ALE achieved more than 13% absolute improvement in the predictive capabilities of the framework when classifying conditions as severe. These results demonstrate the potential of AL methods to decrease the labeling efforts of medical experts, while increasing accuracy given the same (or even a smaller) number of acquired conditions. We also demonstrated that the methods included in the CAESAR-ALE framework (Exploitation and Combination_XA) are more robust to the use of human labelers with different levels of professional expertise.", "Keywords": ["Active learning", "Condition", "Electronic Health Records", "Phenotyping", "Severity"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Automation", "Data Curation", "Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Problem-Based Learning"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nir", "Last Name": "Nissim", "Affiliation": "Information Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel; Malware Lab, Cyber Security Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

The development of an Abstraction Network and its associated QA methodologies, however, is a labor-intensive process that previously was applicable only to one ontology at a time. To improve the efficiency of the Abstraction-Network-based QA methodology, we introduced a QA framework that uses uniform Abstraction Network derivation techniques and QA methodologies that are applicable to whole families of structurally similar ontologies. For the family-based framework to be successful, it is necessary to develop a method for classifying ontologies into structurally similar families. We now describe a structural meta-ontology that classifies ontologies according to certain structural features that are commonly used in the modeling of ontologies (e.g., object properties) and that are important for Abstraction Network derivation. Each class of the structural meta-ontology represents a family of ontologies with identical structural features, indicating which types of Abstraction Networks and QA methodologies are potentially applicable to all of the ontologies in the family. We derive a collection of 81 families, corresponding to classes of the structural meta-ontology, that enable a flexible, streamlined family-based QA methodology, offering multiple choices for classifying an ontology. The structure of 373 ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal is analyzed and each ontology is classified into multiple families modeled by the structural meta-ontology.", "Keywords": ["Abstraction network", "Family-based ontology quality assurance", "Ontology classification", "Structural meta-ontology"], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Ontologies", "Quality Control"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Ochs", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.

DDIs are responsible for many adverse drug effects (ADEs), decreasing patient quality of life and causing higher care expenses. DDIs are not systematically evaluated in pre-clinical or clinical trials and so the FDA U. S. Food and Drug Administration relies on post-marketing surveillance to monitor patient safety. However, existing pharmacovigilance algorithms show poor performance for detecting DDIs exhibiting prohibitively high false positive rates. Alternatively, methods based on chemical structure and pharmacological similarity have shown promise in adverse drug event detection. We hypothesize that the use of chemical biology data in a post hoc analysis of pharmacovigilance results will significantly improve the detection of dangerous interactions. Our model integrates a reference standard of DDIs known to cause arrhythmias with drug similarity data. To compare similarity between drugs we used chemical structure (both 2D and 3D molecular structure), adverse drug side effects, chemogenomic targets, drug indication classes, and known drug-drug interactions. We evaluated the method on external reference standards. Our results showed an enhancement of sensitivity, specificity and precision in different top positions with the use of similarity measures to rank the candidates extracted from pharmacovigilance data. For the top 100 DDI candidates, similarity-based modeling yielded close to twofold precision enhancement compared to the proportional reporting ratio (PRR).

While these alleles often cause large relative risk, their predictive values are quite low due to low prevalence of idiosyncratic DILI. Finding additional risk factors is important for precision medicine. However, optimal design of further genetic studies is hindered by uncertain overall heritability of DILI. This is a common problem for low-prevalence pharmacological traits, since it is difficult to obtain clinical outcome data in families. Here we estimated the heritability (h(2)) of DILI from case-control genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a method based on random effect models. We estimated the proportion of h(2) captured by common SNPs for DILI to be between 0.3 and 0.5. For co-amoxiclav induced DILI, chromosome 6 explained part of the heritability, indicating additional contributions from common variants yet to be found. We performed simulations to assess the robustness of the h(2) estimate with limited sample size under low prevelance, a condition typical to studies on idiosyncratic pharmacological traits. Our findings suggest that common variants outside of HLA contribute to DILI susceptability; therefore, it is valuable to conduct further GWAS with expanded case collection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination", "Case-Control Studies", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6", "Floxacillin", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "beta-Lactamase Inhibitors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Casey Lynnette", "Last Name": "Overby", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY [2]."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY [2] Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY [3] JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2014Jul21"}, {"PMID": "24933368", "Title": "Dynamical phenotyping: using temporal analysis of clinically collected physiologic data to stratify populations.", "Abstract": "Using glucose time series data from a well measured population drawn from an electronic health record (EHR) repository, the variation in predictability of glucose values quantified by the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) was explained using a mechanistic endocrine model and manual and automated review of written patient records.

It was found that on a fine scale in parameter variation, the less insulin required to process glucose, a condition that correlates with good health, the more predictable glucose values were. Nevertheless, the most powerful effect on predictability in the EHR subpopulation was the presence or absence of variation in health state, specifically, in- and out-of-control glucose versus in-control glucose.

Genetic counselors are an ideal group to study when designing tools to support cancer P4 Medicine activities more broadly. The goal for this work was to gain a better understanding of the information cancer genetic counselors seek from their patients to facilitate effective information exchange for discussing risk. This was an analysis of a qualitative data set from interviews of eight cancer genetic counselors, recruited from three institutions. Genetic counselors at each site were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire. A selective coding approach was used to determine major themes associated with genetic counseling information needs for communicating risk. We generated a model for understanding categories of genetic counseling information needs to support risk communication activities. Common activities for risk communication included risk assessment and tailoring communication. Categories of information needs included: (a) clinical patient characteristics, (b) social and cognitive patient characteristics and (c) patient motivation and goals for the genetic counseling session.

Participatory Design methods were applied to support requirements engineering and to create this software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). Using a multi-user constraint satisfaction and resource optimization algorithm, IMPACT automatically synthesizes temporal availability of various research resources and recommends the optimal dates and times for pending research visits. We conducted scenario-based evaluations with 10 clinical research coordinators (CRCs) from diverse clinical research settings to assess the usefulness, feasibility, and user acceptance of IMPACT. We obtained qualitative feedback using semi-structured interviews with the CRCs. Most CRCs acknowledged the usefulness of IMPACT features. Support for collaboration within research teams and interoperability with electronic health records and clinical trial management systems were highly requested features. Overall, IMPACT received satisfactory user acceptance and proves to be potentially useful for a variety of clinical research settings. Our future work includes comparing the effectiveness of IMPACT with that of existing scheduling solutions on the market and conducting field tests to formally assess user adoption.", "Keywords": ["Clinical research informatics", "Health resources", "Learning health systems", "Personnel staffing and scheduling", "Software", "Workflow"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Appointments and Schedules", "Biomedical Research", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Delivery of Health Care", "Learning", "Models, Organizational", "Patient Care", "Privacy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. cw2384@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Solomon", "Last Name": "Berhe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary Regina", "Last Name": "Boland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Junfeng", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory W", "Last Name": "Hruby", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard C", "Last Name": "Steinman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Lopez-Jimenez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Busacca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Thomas", "Last Name": "Bigger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23495669", "Title": "Discovering medical conditions associated with periodontitis using linked electronic health records.", "Abstract": "To use linked electronic medical and dental records to discover associations between periodontitis and medical conditions independent of a priori hypotheses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alcoholism", "Case-Control Studies", "Clinical Coding", "Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic", "Data Collection", "Data Mining", "Dental Records", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Electronic Health Records", "Epidemiology", "Female", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Hyperlipidemias", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York", "Obesity", "Parturition", "Periodontitis", "Pregnancy", "Prostatic Hyperplasia", "Tobacco Use Disorder"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary Regina", "Last Name": "Boland", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. mab7036@dbmi.columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam B", "Last Name": "Wilcox", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Breene", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronnie", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Zimmerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Panos N", "Last Name": "Papapanou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical periodontology", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "25848563", "Title": "Recommendations for the use of operational electronic health record data in comparative effectiveness research.", "Abstract": "There is an increasing amount of clinical data in operational electronic health record (EHR) systems.
