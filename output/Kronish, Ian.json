SCA-induced PTSD is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk, yet no psychotherapeutic treatment has been developed and tested for this population. Exposure therapy is standard treatment for PTSD, but its safety and efficacy remain unconfirmed for SCA survivors: current protocols do not address their specific disease course and have high attrition. Mindfulness-based interventions are typically well-tolerated and have shown promise in reducing PTSD symptoms from other traumas. Objective: This study sought to determine feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and mindfulness-based exposure therapy (AMBET), a novel SCA-specific psychotherapy protocol combining mindfulness and exposure-based interventions with cardiac focused psychoeducation to reduce symptoms and improve health behaviors in patients with post-SCA PTSD. Methods: We conducted an open feasibility pilot study from January 2021 to April 2022 with a small sample (N\u2009=\u200911) of SCA survivors meeting DSM-5 PTSD criteria. AMBET comprised eight 90-minute remotely delivered individual sessions. Clinical evaluators assessed PTSD symptoms using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) at baseline, midpoint, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Ten (91%) of 11 enrolled patients completed treatment. Satisfaction was high and patients reported no adverse events. PTSD symptoms significantly improved statistically (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and clinically with large effect sizes (g\u2009=\u20091.34-2.21) and treatment gains sustained at 3-month follow-up. Posttreatment, 80% of completers (n\u2009=\u20098) showed significant treatment response, 70% (n\u2009=\u20097) with PTSD diagnostic remission. No patient reported symptom increases. Conclusions: This initial trial found AMBET feasible, safe, and potentially efficacious in reducing PTSD following SCA. These encouraging pilot results warrant further research.

controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor's heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later. FAID Fear represents a first step in building theory-based dyadic interventions that can be implemented to support family members of CA survivors in the ICU, with potential to improve outcomes in CA survivors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Fear", "Survivors", "Intensive Care Units", "Heart Arrest"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Talea", "Last Name": "Cornelius", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Mendieta", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robin M", "Last Name": "Cumella", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Lopez Veneros", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Isabella M", "Last Name": "Tincher", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Kronish", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37442816", "Title": "Antihypertensive medication nonadherence and target organ damage in children with chronic kidney disease.", "Abstract": "Nonadherence is common in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Despite availability of effective lifestyle and medication treatments, blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled in the United States. Mindfulness training may offer a novel approach to improve BP control. The objective was to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) versus enhanced usual care control on unattended office systolic BP. Methods and Results Methods included a parallel-group phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted from June 2017 to November 2020. Follow-up time was 6\u2009months. Outcome assessors and data analyst were blinded to group allocation. Participants had elevated unattended office BP (\u2265120/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg). We randomized 201 participants to MB-BP (n=101) or enhanced usual care control (n=100). MB-BP is a mindfulness-based program adapted for elevated BP. Loss-to-follow-up was 17.4%. The primary outcome was change in unattended office systolic BP at 6 months. A total of 201 participants (58.7% women; 81.1% non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity; mean age, 59.5\u2009years) were randomized. Results showed that MB-BP was associated with a 5.9-mm\u2009Hg reduction (95% CI, -9.1 to -2.8\u2009mm Hg) in systolic BP from baseline and outperformed the control group by 4.5\u2009mm\u2009Hg at 6\u2009months (95% CI, -9.0 to -0.1\u2009mm Hg) in prespecified analyses. Plausible mechanisms with evidence to be impacted by MB-BP versus control were sedentary activity (-350.8 sitting min/wk [95% CI, -636.5 to -65.1] sitting min/wk), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (0.32 score [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.67]), and mindfulness (7.3 score [95% CI, 3.0-11.6]). Conclusions A mindfulness-based program adapted for individuals with elevated BP showed clinically relevant reductions in systolic BP compared with enhanced usual care. Mindfulness training may be a useful approach to improve BP.

To deal with this issue in situations where a high volume of measurements are made during the study, we introduce a novel Bayesian distributed lag model that facilitates the estimation of carryover effects, while accounting for temporal correlations using an autoregressive model. Specifically, we propose a prior variance-covariance structure on the lag coefficients to address collinearity caused by the fact that treatment exposures are typically identical on successive days. A connection between the proposed Bayesian model and penalized regression is noted. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model substantially reduces the root mean squared error in the estimation of carryover effects and immediate effects when compared to other existing methods, while being comparable in the estimation of the total effects.

However, relatively high copayments for ARNI may contribute to suboptimal adherence, thus potentially limiting their benefits. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a large, multi-site health system. We included patients with: ARNI prescription between November 20, 2020 and June 30, 2021; diagnosis of heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction \u226440%; and available pharmacy or pharmacy benefit manager copayment data. The primary exposure was copayment, categorized as $0, $0.01 to $10, $10.01 to $100, and >$100. The primary outcome was prescription fill nonadherence, defined as the proportion of days covered <80% over 6\u2009months. We assessed the association between copayment and nonadherence using multivariable logistic regression, and nonbinarized proportion of days covered using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and neighborhood-level covariates. A total of 921 patients met inclusion criteria, with 192 (20.8%) having $0 copayment, 228 (24.8%) with $0.01 to $10 copayment, 206 (22.4%) with $10.01 to $100, and 295 (32.0%) with >$100. Patients with higher copayments had higher rates of nonadherence, ranging from 17.2% for $0 copayment to 34.2% for copayment >$100 (P<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, odds of nonadherence were significantly higher for copayment of $10.01 to $100 (odds ratio [OR], 1.93 [95% CI, 1.15-3.27], P=0.01) or >$100 (OR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.63-4.18], P<0.001), as compared with $0 copayment. Similar associations were seen when assessing proportion of days covered as a proportion. Conclusions We found higher rates of not filling ARNI prescriptions among patients with higher copayments, which persisted after multivariable adjustment.

The current narrative review will describe an innovative patient-centred approach to deprescribing-N-of-1 trials. N-of-1 trials involve multiple-period crossover design experiments conducted within individual patients. They enable patients to compare the effects of two or more treatments or, in the case of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, continuation with a current treatment versus no treatment or placebo. N-of-1 trials are distinct from traditional between-patient studies such as parallel-group or crossover designs which provide an average effect across a group of patients and obscure differences between individuals. By generating data on the effect of an intervention for the individual rather than the population, N-of-1 trials can promote therapeutic precision. N-of-1 trials are a particularly appealing strategy to inform deprescribing because they can generate individual-level evidence for deprescribing when evidence is uncertain, and can thus allay patient and physician concerns about discontinuing medications. To illustrate the use of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, we share a case example of an ongoing series of N-of-1 trials that compare maintenance versus deprescribing of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

In this article, we summarize relevant concepts, describe how climate change and structural racism intersect to exacerbate health inequities, and recommend six strategies with the greatest potential for addressing climate-related health inequities.", "Keywords": ["Climate change", "Environmental justice", "Health inequities", "Structural racism"], "MeSH terms": ["Behavioral Medicine", "Climate Change", "Health Equity", "Health Inequities", "Humans", "Public Health"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leticia", "Last Name": "Nogueira", "Affiliation": "American Cancer Society, Kennesaw, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristi E", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Hennepin Healthcare, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brooke", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katie E", "Last Name": "Alegria", "Affiliation": "University of California-Merced, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gary", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Edmondson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elissa", "Last Name": "Epel", "Affiliation": "University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Alison", "Last Name": "Holman", "Affiliation": "University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Kronish", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Thayer", "Affiliation": "University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational behavioral medicine", "PubDate": "2022May25"}, {"PMID": "35568129", "Title": "Association of Perceived Stress With Incident Heart Failure.", "Abstract": "The relationship between psychological stress and heart failure (HF) has not been well studied.

However, this survival benefit attenuates with increased acculturation to Western lifestyles, potentially due to adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Accordingly, we assessed whether Hispanic ethnicity and linguistic acculturation, as measured by English proficiency, were associated with nonadherence to cardiovascular medications. We enrolled patients presenting to an academic medical center emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome between May 2014 and November 2017. Ethnicity, native language, and English proficiency were self-reported. Cardiovascular medication adherence was assessed using an electronic pill bottle that recorded the date and time of each bottle opening. Generalized linear models with a logit link were used to examine the association of Hispanic ethnicity and English proficiency with daily cardiovascular medication adherence, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and dosing frequency of the electronically-monitored medication. Among 332 included patients, mean age was 61.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.05\u00a0years, 43.07% were women, and 62.95% were Hispanic, of whom 80.38% were native Spanish-speakers. Overall, Hispanics had higher odds of medication adherence than non-Hispanics (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.49, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, among native Spanish-speaking Hispanics, greater English proficiency was associated with lower odds of medication adherence (adjusted OR 0.80 per 1-point increase in English proficiency, 95% CI 0.75-0.86, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The pandemic tested existing remote monitoring efforts, revealing numerous operating challenges including device management, centralized escalation protocols, and health equity concerns. The continuation of these programs required addressing these concerns while expanding monitoring efforts in ambulatory and transitions of care settings.

Methods and Results We pooled individual participant data from 4 randomized clinical trials of SMBP in the United Kingdom (combined n=2590) with varying intensities of support. Multivariable random effects regression was used to estimate the probability of antihypertensive intensification at 12\u00a0months for usual care versus SMBP. Using these data, we simulated 5-year BP control rates using a validated mathematical model. Trial participants were mostly older adults (mean age 66.6\u00a0years, SD 9.5), male (53.9%), and predominantly white (95.6%); mean baseline BP was 151.8/85.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Compared with usual care, the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification increased with both SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and with telemonitoring or self-management (3.3, 2.5-4.2). Over 5\u00a0years, we estimated 33.4% BP control (<140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) with usual care (95% uncertainty interval 27.7%-39.4%). One year of SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone achieved 33.9% (28.3%-40.3%) BP control and SMBP with telemonitoring or self-management 39.0% (33.1%-45.2%) over 5\u00a0years. If SMBP interventions and associated BP control processes were extended to 5\u00a0years, BP control increased to 52.4% (45.4%-59.8 %) and 72.1% (66.5%-77.6%), respectively.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BWL versus dim red light therapy (DRL) on depressive symptoms within individual cancer survivors using personalized (N-of-1) trials. Methods: Cancer survivors with at least mild depressive symptoms were randomized to one of two treatment sequences consisting of counterbalanced crossover comparisons of three-weeks of lightbox-delivered BWL (intervention) or DRL (sham) for 30 min each morning across 12 weeks. A smartphone application guided cancer survivors through the treatment sequence and facilitated data collection. Cancer survivors tracked end-of-day depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and fatigue using visual analog scales. Within-patient effects of BWL were assessed using an autoregressive model with adjustment for linear time trends. Results: Eight of nine cancer survivors completed the 12-week protocol. Two survivors reported significantly (i.e., p < 0.05) lower depressive symptoms (-1.3 \u00b1 0.5 and -1.30 \u00b1 0.9 points on a 10-point scale), five reported no difference in depressive symptoms, and one reported higher depressive symptoms (+1.7 \u00b1 0.6 points) with BWL versus DRL. Eight of nine cancer survivors recommended personalized trials of BWL to others. Conclusions: There were heterogeneous effects of three-week BWL on self-reported depressive symptoms among cancer survivors, with some finding a benefit but others finding no benefit or even harm. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Personalized trials can help cancer survivors learn if BWL is helpful for improving their depressive symptoms.", "Keywords": ["N-of-1 trials", "bright white light therapy", "cancer survivor", "depression", "personalized medicine."], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Kronish", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying Kuen", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Julian", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Faith", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sunmoo", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heidis", "Last Name": "Valdimarsdottir", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paige", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20850, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerry", "Last Name": "Suls", "Affiliation": "Center for Personalized Medicine, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, New York, NY 10022, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karina W", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "Center for Personalized Medicine, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, New York, NY 10022, USA."}], "Journal": "Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2019Dec30"}, {"PMID": "31903438", "Title": "The Impact of Cardiac-induced Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms on Cardiovascular Outcomes: Design and Rationale of the Prospective Observational Reactions to Acute Care and Hospitalizations (ReACH) Study.", "Abstract": "As many as 1 in 8 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the ACS, and ACS-induced PTSD may increase secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Using a randomized, controlled design, this pilot study reports on the feasibility and preliminary effects of a novel, guided symptom exposure augmented cognitive behavioral prevention intervention (GSE-CBT) in a sample diagnosed with Hepatitis C at risk for developing medication induced depression. Results demonstrated that the guided symptom exposure augmented CBT (GSE-CBT) was feasible in this population and was delivered with high integrity. Although not statistically different, we observed a pattern of lower depression levels in the GSE-CBT group versus those in the control group throughout. This pilot study demonstrates that a psychosocial prevention intervention is feasible for use in patients at risk for developing pharmacologically induced depression and that a guided symptom exposure augmented CBT protocol has the potential to prevent symptoms of depression that develop as a side effect to taking these medications.

We assessed trends in antihypertensive medication nonpersistence and low adherence among 379\u2009658 commercially insured adults <65 years of age initiating treatment in 2007-2014 using MarketScan claims. Nonpersistence was defined as having no days of medication available to take during the final 90 days of the 365 days following initiation. Among beneficiaries who were persistent to treatment, low adherence was defined by having antihypertensive medication available to take for <80% of the days in the 365 days following initiation (ie, proportion of days covered <80%). In 2007 and 2014, 23.3% and 23.5% of patients were nonpersistent to treatment, respectively, and 42.3% and 40.2% had low adherence, respectively. The relative risks for nonpersistence and low adherence were lower among beneficiaries initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97 and 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98, respectively), angiotensin receptor blocker (0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88 and 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.00, respectively), or multiclass regimen (0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 and 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.89, respectively), prescribed 90-day versus 30-day prescriptions (0.67; 95% CI, 0.66-0.68 and 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71, respectively), or who received medications by mail versus at the pharmacy (0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.95 and 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92, respectively).

In this article, we review research on the prevalence and consequences of such reactions in cardiovascular disease patients, discuss early tests of the EST model, and then report a new test of the EST model in 143 patients enrolled during their first acute coronary syndrome (ACS; i.e., non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina-colloquially, \"heart attack\"). Invasive coronary revascularization procedures are commonly used to reduce secondary ACS risk and may reduce patients' EST, as revascularized patients often report being \"cured.\" We assessed ACS patients' initial threat perceptions during emergency department (ED) evaluation and followed them for 1 month for PTSD symptoms (specific for ACS, by telephone). We compared PTSD symptoms in participants who were revascularized (n = 65), catheterized but not revascularized (n = 35), and medically managed (n = 43). PTSD symptoms were lower for revascularized versus medically managed participants (B = -5.32, 95% confidence interval [-9.77, -0.87]), t(98.19) = -2.37, p = .020. In a multiple regression model adjusted for clinical and psychosocial covariates, the interaction of threat perception in the ED and ACS management group was significant (greater ED threat predicted greater 1-month PTSD symptoms only in medically managed participants). These findings offer further support for the EST model and suggest that psychological interventions to preempt patients' development of EST should be considered in the hospital.

Shared decision making (SDM) is recommended prior to initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention but is underutilized. We designed an informatics decision-support tool to facilitate use of the Mayo Clinic Statin Choice decision aid at the point-of-care and evaluated its impact. Methods. Using an iterative approach, we designed and implemented a single-click decision-support tool embedded within the electronic health records (EHRs) to automate the calculation of 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and populate the Statin Choice decision aid. We surveyed primary care providers at two clinics regarding their attitudes about SDM before and after deployment of intervention, as well as their usage of and perceived competence regarding SDM for primary prevention statin therapy. Three-month web traffic to the Statin Choice website was calculated before and after deployment of the intervention. Results. Pre-post surveys were completed by 60 primary care providers (24 [40%] attending physicians and 36 [60%] housestaff physicians). After deployment of the EHR tool, respondents were more aware of the Statin Choice decision aid (P < 0.001), reported being more competent regarding SDM (P = 0.047), and reported using decision aids more often when considering statin initiation (P = 0.043). There was no significant change in attitudes about SDM as measured through the Patient Provider Orientation Scale (pre 4.23 \u00b1 0.40 v. post 4.16 \u00b1 0.38, P = 0.11) and the SDM belief scale (pre 21.4 \u00b1 2.1 v. post 21.1 \u00b1 2.0, P = 0.35). Web-based usage rates for the Statin Choice decision aid increased from 3.4 to 5.2 per 1,000 outpatient clinic visits (P = 0.002). Conclusions.

The mechanisms of PTSD-related nonadherence are poorly understood. We tested whether patients with elevated PTSD symptoms induced by suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were more likely to have aversive cognitions towards cardiovascular medications. We enrolled a consecutive cohort of patients who presented to the emergency department with suspected ACS. One month after discharge, ACS-induced PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL-S), and patients were asked \"how often did\" (1) \"you miss your heart medication because you did not want to be reminded about your heart problem\"; (2) \"thinking about your heart medication make you feel nervous or anxious\"; and (3) \"thinking about your heart medication make you think about your risk for future heart problems.\" Logistic regression was used to determine the association between elevated PTSD symptoms and each aversive cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, depression, and ACS status. Of 424 patients included, 15.8% had elevated PTSD symptoms (PCL-S\u00a0\u2265\u00a034). In adjusted analyses, higher PCL-S scores were associated with missing medications to avoid reminders of heart disease (OR 1.22 per 5-point PCL-S increase, 95%CI 1.07-1.40), as well as anxiety (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.19-1.51) and thoughts of future risk (OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.08-1.32) when thinking about cardiovascular medications.

We included randomized and quasi-randomized NIH-funded trials with medication adherence in adults as the primary outcome. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases from inception to 6/2016, references, and clinicaltrials.gov. Two of 18 (11%) NIH-funded trials tested a hypothesized mechanism of an intervention's effect on medication adherence. Another 44 studies with medication adherence as a secondary outcome were described in protocol form, and are either ongoing or never published results, but none mentioned mechanism tests. Overall, 3% of NIH-funded trials with adherence as an outcome conducted, or plan to conduct, tests of behavior change mechanisms. These results mirror previous findings that very few studies of behavior change interventions actually test the mechanism by which the intervention is hypothesized to improve health behaviors.

We analyzed a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive medication between 2007 and 2012 to assess whether reductions occurred in discontinuation and low adherence. Discontinuation was defined as having no days of antihypertensive medication supply for the final 90 days of the 365 days after initiation. Low adherence was defined as having a proportion of days covered <80% during the 365 days after initiation among beneficiaries who did not discontinue treatment. Between 2007 and 2012, 41\u2009135 Medicare beneficiaries in the 5% sample initiated antihypertensive medication. Discontinuation was stable during the study period (21.0% in 2007 and 21.3% in 2012; P-trend=0.451). Low adherence decreased from 37.4% in 2007 to 31.7% in 2012 (P-trend<0.001).

We assessed the association between antihypertensive medication adherence and VVV of BP in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). VVV of BP was calculated using SD independent of mean, SD, and average real variability across study visits conducted 6 to 28 months after randomization. Participants who reported taking <80% of their antihypertensive medication at \u22651 study visits were categorized as nonadherent. Participants were followed up for cardiovascular events and mortality after the assessment of adherence and VVV of BP. SD independent of mean of BP was higher for nonadherent (n=2912) versus adherent (n=16\u2009878) participants; 11.4\u00b14.9 versus 10.5\u00b14.5 for systolic BP; 6.8\u00b12.8 versus 6.2\u00b12.6 for diastolic BP (each P<0.001). SD independent of mean of BP remained higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants after multivariable adjustment (0.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.0] higher for systolic BP and 0.4 [95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.5] higher for diastolic BP]. SD and average real variability of systolic BP and diastolic BP were also higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants. Adjustment for nonadherence did not explain the association of VVV of BP with higher fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or mortality risk. In conclusion, improving medication adherence may lower VVV of BP.

In this design, the effect of an intervention on one group of patients is compared with the effect of a control condition on another group of patients, such that a between-subject change is tested. A between-subject design has an underlying assumption that there is a homogenous treatment effect for a behavioral intervention, drug or psychotherapy, and that the way the intervention operates in the study that will tend to operate in the same way in many other patients. We review some of the philosophical and practical problems with the use of this design when a clinician is attempting to decide on a course of behavioral treatment aimed at within-subject change in patients who are likely to have heterogeneous or unique responses to behavioral treatment. We also review the biases inherent in our current clinical practice model, which does not use any empirical data collection or design for testing if a treatment is useful, and also in the conventional between-subject personalized medicine RCT designs. We propose increased use of single-patient (also known as N-of-1) trials that employ within-subject designs, in cases where treatment response is heterogeneous-as is the case for most psychological and behavioral treatments. Limitations of such designs include that they can only be used when the treatment is potentially reversible, the patient can act as their own control, and the outcome can be measured repeatedly. Increased use of within-subject trials may address in many more instances the more clinically relevant question of how a specific patient will respond to a specific treatment, and could introduce a more harmonious scientific approach into the way we treat our patients.

Patients who present to overcrowded EDs develop more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms due to the ACS than do patients who present to less crowded EDs, but no research has indicated whether some patients may be more vulnerable to the effects of ED crowding than others. In an observational cohort study, we tested whether depressed patients developed more ACS-induced PTSD symptoms under conditions of ED overcrowding than patients who had never been depressed. We conducted psychiatric interviews for current and past depression in 189 ACS patients admitted through the ED within a week of hospitalization, and screened for PTSD symptoms 1 month later using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The sum of ED admissions for the 12\u00a0h prior to and 12\u00a0h after each participant's admission was categorized into tertiles for analysis. In a 3 (ED crowding tertile) by 3 (never, past, current depression) analysis of covariance adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, we found significant effects for ED crowding, depression status, and their interaction (all p's\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Mean PTSD scores were significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a0.005) for participants who were currently depressed and were treated during times of high ED crowding [25.38, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a016.18-34.58], or had a history of depression [10.74, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a06.86-14.62], relative to all other participants, who scored 5.6 or less.
