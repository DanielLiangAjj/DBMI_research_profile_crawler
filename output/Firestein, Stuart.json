Odor molecules are typically organic compounds of low molecular weight that may be aliphatic or aromatic, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may have diverse functional polar groups. However, many molecules conforming to these characteristics are odorless. One approach recently used to solve this problem was to apply machine learning strategies to a large set of odors and human classifiers in an attempt to find common and unique chemical features that would predict a chemical's odor. We use an alternative method that relies more on the biological responses of olfactory sensory neurons and then applies the principles of medicinal chemistry, a technique widely used in drug discovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy through a classification for esters, an important odorant for the creation of flavor in wine.

However, information regarding the efferent projections of PCX and how those may be involved in odor representation and object recognition has been largely ignored. To investigate this aspect of PCX, we have used the efferent pathway from mouse PCX to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Using double fluorescent retrograde tracing, we identified the output neurons (OPNs) of the PCX that project to two subdivisions of the OFC, the agranular insula and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (AI-OPNs and LO-OPNs, respectively). We found that both AI-OPNs and LO-OPNs showed a distinct spatial topography within the PCX and fewer than 10% projected to both the AI and the LO as judged by double-labeling. These data revealed that the efferent component of the PCX may be topographically organized. Further, these data suggest a model for functional organization of the PCX in which the OPNs are grouped into parallel output circuits that provide olfactory information to different higher centers.

A homology model based on an activated GPCR X-ray structure provides a structural hypothesis for activation of OR-I7 by the gem-diol of octanal.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aldehydes", "Animals", "Rats", "Receptors, Odorant"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yadi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The City College of New York, and Biochemistry Program, The City University of New York Graduate Center , New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zita", "Last Name": "Peterlin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianghai", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tali", "Last Name": "Yarnitzky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Min Ting", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Merav", "Last Name": "Fichman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masha Y", "Last Name": "Niv", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroaki", "Last Name": "Matsunami", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stuart", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2014Nov21"}, {"PMID": "25018692", "Title": "A lifetime of neurogenesis in the olfactory system.", "Abstract": "Neurogenesis continues well beyond embryonic and early postnatal ages in three areas of the nervous system. The subgranular zone supplies new neurons to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The subventricular zone supplies new interneurons to the olfactory bulb, and the olfactory neuroepithelia generate new excitatory sensory neurons that send their axons to the olfactory bulb. The latter two areas are of particular interest as they contribute new neurons to both ends of a first-level circuit governing olfactory perception. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium comprise the primary peripheral olfactory epithelia. These anatomically distinct areas share common features, as each exhibits extensive neurogenesis well beyond the juvenile phase of development. Here we will discuss the effect of age on the structural and functional significance of neurogenesis in the vomeronasal and olfactory epithelia, from juvenile to advanced adult ages, in several common model systems. We will next discuss how age affects the regenerative capacity of these neural stem cells in response to injury. Finally, we will consider the integration of newborn neurons into an existing circuit as it is modified by the age of the animal.", "Keywords": ["aging", "proliferation", "regeneration", "renewal", "stem cell"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica H", "Last Name": "Brann", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Loyola University Chicago Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart J", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University New York, NY, USA ; Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24733839", "Title": "The state of the art of odorant receptor deorphanization: a report from the orphanage.", "Abstract": "The odorant receptors (ORs) provide our main gateway to sensing the world of volatile chemicals. This involves a complex encoding process in which multiple ORs, each of which detects its own set of odorants, work as an ensemble to produce a distributed activation code that is presumably unique to each odorant. One marked challenge to decoding the olfactory code is OR deorphanization, the identification of a set of activating odorants for a particular receptor. Here, we survey various methods used to try to express defined ORs of interest. We also suggest strategies for selecting odorants for test panels to evaluate the functional expression of an OR. Integrating these tools, while retaining awareness of their idiosyncratic limitations, can provide a multi-tiered approach to OR deorphanization, spanning the initial discovery of a ligand to vetting that ligand in a physiologically relevant setting.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cloning, Molecular", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Ligands", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, Odorant"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zita", "Last Name": "Peterlin", "Affiliation": "Corporate Research and Development, Firmenich Incorporated, Plainsboro, NJ 08536."}, {"First Name": "Stuart", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew E", "Last Name": "Rogers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "PubDate": "2014May"}, {"PMID": "23419702", "Title": "Age-dependent regional changes in the rostral migratory stream.", "Abstract": "Throughout life the subventricular zone (SVZ) is a source of new olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. From the SVZ, neuroblasts migrate tangentially through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), a restricted route approximately 5 mm long in mice, reaching the OB within 10-14 days. Within the OB, neuroblasts migrate radially to the granule and glomerular layers where they differentiate into granule and periglomerular (PG) cells and integrate into existing synaptic circuits. SVZ neurogenesis decreases with age, and might be a factor in age-related olfactory deficits. However, the effect of aging on the RMS and on the differentiation of interneuron subpopulations remains poorly understood. Here, we examine RMS cytoarchitecture, neuroblast proliferation and clearance from the RMS, and PG cell subpopulations at 6, 12, 18, and 23 months of age. We find that aging affects the area occupied by newly generated cells within the RMS and regional proliferation, and the clearance of neuroblasts from the RMS and PG cell subpopulations and distribution remain stable.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurogenesis", "Olfactory Bulb"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arie S", "Last Name": "Mobley", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex K", "Last Name": "Bryant", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marion B", "Last Name": "Richard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica H", "Last Name": "Brann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stuart J", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles A", "Last Name": "Greer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurobiology of aging", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23401498", "Title": "Olfactory receptor responding to gut microbiota-derived signals plays a role in renin secretion and blood pressure regulation.", "Abstract": "Olfactory receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate olfactory chemosensation and serve as chemosensors in other tissues. We find that Olfr78, an olfactory receptor expressed in the kidney, responds to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Olfr78 is expressed in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, where it mediates renin secretion in response to SCFAs. In addition, both Olfr78 and G protein-coupled receptor 41 (Gpr41), another SCFA receptor, are expressed in smooth muscle cells of small resistance vessels. Propionate, a SCFA shown to induce vasodilation ex vivo, produces an acute hypotensive response in wild-type mice. This effect is differentially modulated by disruption of Olfr78 and Gpr41 expression. SCFAs are end products of fermentation by the gut microbiota and are absorbed into the circulation. Antibiotic treatment reduces the biomass of the gut microbiota and elevates blood pressure in Olfr78 knockout mice. We conclude that SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota modulate blood pressure via Olfr78 and Gpr41.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomass", "Blood Pressure", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hypertension", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Intestines", "Kidney", "Metagenome", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Propionates", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Receptors, Odorant", "Renin", "Signal Transduction", "Vasodilation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Pluznick", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. jpluznick@jhmi.edu"}, {"First Name": "Ryan J", "Last Name": "Protzko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Haykanush", "Last Name": "Gevorgyan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zita", "Last Name": "Peterlin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arnold", "Last Name": "Sipos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jinah", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Brunet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "La-Xiang", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Federico", "Last Name": "Rey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stuart J", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Yanagisawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey I", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Eichmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janos", "Last Name": "Peti-Peterdi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Caplan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Mar12"}]
