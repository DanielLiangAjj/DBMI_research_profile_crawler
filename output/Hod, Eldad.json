While VHAs have enabled guided hemorrhage control therapies, improving clinical outcomes in life-threatening hemorrhage, the role of VHAs in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. If VHAs can identify coagulation abnormalities relevant for ICH outcomes, this would support the need to investigate the role of VHAs in ICH treatment paradigms.

We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]). After adjusting for disease severity and other relevant covariates, we found no significant association between RBC transfusion and mortality (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.45-1.66]) or poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score (aOR, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.80-7.61]).

Few effective measures exist to prevent RBC alloimmunization and/or eliminate alloantibodies in sensitized patients. Donor-related factors may influence alloimmunization; thus, there is an unmet clinical need to identify which RBC units are immunogenic. Repeat volunteer blood donors and donors on iron supplements have elevated reticulocyte counts compared to healthy non-donors. Early reticulocytes retain mitochondria and other components, which may act as danger signals in immune responses. Herein, we tested whether reticulocytes in donor RBC units could enhance RBC alloimmunization. Using a murine model, we demonstrate that transfusing donor RBC units with increased reticulocyte frequencies dose-dependently increased RBC alloimmunization rates and alloantibody levels. Transfusing reticulocyte-rich RBC units was associated with increased RBC clearance from the circulation and a robust proinflammatory cytokine response. As compared to previously reported post-transfusion RBC consumption patterns, erythrophagocytosis from reticulocyte-rich units was increasingly performed by splenic B cells.

The association of infection with prevalent socio-economic conditions was assessed by the area deprivation index (ADI). There were 50 overall cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (28%) including 40 demonstrating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (indicative of prior infection) and 10 positive PCR tests.

Few effective measures exist to prevent RBC alloimmunization and/or eliminate alloantibodies in sensitized patients. Donor-related factors may influence alloimmunization; thus, there is an unmet clinical need to identify which RBC units are immunogenic. Repeat volunteer blood donors and donors on iron supplements have elevated reticulocyte counts compared to healthy non-donors. Early reticulocytes retain mitochondria and other components, which may act as danger signals in immune responses. Herein, we tested whether reticulocytes in donor RBC units could enhance RBC alloimmunization. Using a murine model, we demonstrate that transfusing donor RBC units with increased reticulocyte frequencies dose-dependently increase RBC alloimmunization rates and alloantibody levels. Transfusing reticulocyte-rich RBC units was associated with increased RBC clearance from the circulation and a robust proinflammatory cytokine response. As compared to previously reported post-transfusion RBC consumption patterns, erythrophagocytosis from reticulocyte-rich units was increasingly performed by splenic B cells. These data suggest that reticulocytes in a donated RBC unit impact the quality of blood transfused, are targeted to a distinct compartment, and may be an underappreciated risk factor for RBC alloimmunization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany A", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher Y", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dominique E", "Last Name": "Gordy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anabel", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Tredicine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Flavia Dei", "Last Name": "Zotti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D\u00e2 Alessandro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Jan25"}, {"PMID": "36661453", "Title": "Hemoglobin Concentration Impacts Viscoelastic Hemostatic Assays in ICU Admitted Patients.", "Abstract": "Low hemoglobin concentration impairs clinical hemostasis across several diseases.

disorder characterized by sickled red blood cells (RBCs), which are more sensitive to haemolysis and can contribute to disease pathophysiology. Although treatment of SCD can include RBC transfusion, patients with SCD have high rates of alloimmunization. We hypothesized that RBCs from patients with SCD have functionally active mitochondria and can elicit a type 1 interferon response. We evaluated blood samples from more than 100 patients with SCD and found elevated frequencies of mitochondria in reticulocytes and mature RBCs, as compared to healthy blood donors. The presence of mitochondria in mature RBCs was confirmed by flow cytometry, electron microscopy, and proteomic analysis. The mitochondria in mature RBCs were metabolically competent, as determined by enzymatic activities and elevated levels of mitochondria-derived metabolites. Metabolically-active mitochondria in RBCs may increase oxidative stress, which could facilitate and/or exacerbate SCD complications. Coculture of mitochondria-positive RBCs with neutrophils induced production of type 1 interferons, which are known to increase RBC alloimmunization rates. These data demonstrate that mitochondria retained in mature RBCs are functional and can elicit immune responses, suggesting that inappropriate retention of mitochondria in RBCs may play an underappreciated role in SCD complications and be an RBC alloimmunization risk factor.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Erythrocytes", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Proteomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Micaela", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Roingeard", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1259 and Electron Microscopy Facility, Universit\u00e9 de Tours and CHRU de Tours, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "June Young", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Transfusion Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Gibb", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Transfusion Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Tredicine", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Section of General Pathology, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marlon A", "Last Name": "McGill", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "La Carpia", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Imo J", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chance John", "Last Name": "Luckey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "British journal of haematology", "PubDate": "2022Aug"}, {"PMID": "35557972", "Title": "Deuterated Linoleic Acid Attenuates the RBC Storage Lesion in a Mouse Model of Poor RBC Storage.", "Abstract": "Background: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important modulators of red blood cell (RBC) rheology. Dietary PUFAs are readily incorporated into the RBC membrane, improving RBC deformability, fluidity, and hydration. However, enriching the lipid membrane with PUFAs increases the potential for peroxidation in oxidative environments (e.g., refrigerated storage), resulting in membrane damage. Substitution of bis-allylic hydrogens with deuterium ions in PUFAs decreases hydrogen abstraction, thereby inhibiting peroxidation. If lipid peroxidation is a causal factor in the RBC storage lesion, incorporation of deuterated linoleic acid (DLA) into the RBC membrane should decrease lipid peroxidation, thereby improving RBC lifespan, deformability, filterability, and post-transfusion recovery (PTR) after cold storage. Study Design and Methods: Mice associated with good (C57BL/6J) and poor (FVB) RBC storage quality received diets containing 11,11-D2-LA Ethyl Ester (1.0\u00a0g/100\u00a0g diet; deuterated linoleic acid) or non-deuterated LA Ethyl Ester (control) for 8\u00a0weeks. Deformability, filterability, lipidomics, and lipid peroxidation markers were evaluated in fresh and stored RBCs. Results: DLA was incorporated into RBC membranes in both mouse strains. DLA diet decreased lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) by 25.4 and 31% percent in C57 mice and 12.9 and 79.9% in FVB mice before and after cold storage, respectively. In FVB, but not C57 mice, deformability filterability, and post-transfusion recovery were significantly improved.

The current World Health Organization threshold of <15 \u00b5g/L for iron deficiency in women is based on expert opinion. We examined the relationship between serum ferritin and 2 independently measured indicators of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and hemoglobin, in baseline data from 286 women, 20 to 49 years, who were first-time or reactivated donors in the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II\u00a0Donor Iron Status Evaluation (REDS-RISE) study. At lower serum ferritin concentrations, median sTfR increased as hemoglobin decreased. Using restricted cubic spline regression analysis to determine thresholds for iron-deficient erythropoiesis, the thresholds identified by sTfR (serum ferritin < 25.4 \u00b5g/L) and hemoglobin (serum ferritin < 25.3 \u00b5g/L) did not differ significantly. The thresholds found in the REDS-RISE study do not differ from those identified by sTfR (serum ferritin < 25.5 \u00b5g/L) and hemoglobin (serum ferritin < 26.6 \u00b5g/L) in a previous study of 5442 women, 20 to 49 years, in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2018 (P = .98 and 0.83, respectively).

In patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, iron overload is a common risk factor for poor outcomes. However, no studies have interrogated the multiorgan effects of these treatments concurrently. Herein, we use a model that recapitulates transfusional iron overload, a condition often observed in chronically transfused patients. We applied an omics approach to investigate the impact of both the iron load and irradiation on the host metabolome. The results revealed dose-dependent effects of irradiation in the red blood cells, plasma, spleen, and liver energy and redox metabolism. Increases in polyamines and purine salvage metabolites were observed in organs with high oxygen consumption including the heart, kidneys, and brain. Irradiation also impacted the metabolism of the duodenum, colon, and stool, suggesting a potential effect on the microbiome. Iron infusion affected the response to radiation in the organs and blood, especially in erythrocyte polyamines and spleen antioxidant metabolism, and affected glucose, methionine, and glutathione systems and tryptophan metabolism in the liver, stool, and the brain.

To overcome these limitations, we independently developed a method to quantify multiple protein targets on single cells without the need for specialty equipment other than access to widely available next generation sequencing (NGS) services. We demonstrate that this combinatorial indexing method compares favorably to traditional flow-cytometry, and allows over two dozen target proteins to be assayed at a time on single cells. To showcase the potential of the technique, we analyzed peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates from human clinical samples, and identified pathogenic cellular subsets with high fidelity.

Prior studies identified characteristics associated with variation in hemoglobin increments following transfusion. We extended these observations, examining donor genetic and nongenetic factors affecting transfusion effectiveness.METHODSThis is a multicenter retrospective study of 46,705 patients and 102,043 evaluable RBC transfusions from 2013 to 2016 across 12 hospitals. Transfusion effectiveness was defined as hemoglobin, bilirubin, or creatinine increments following single RBC unit transfusion. Models incorporated a subset of donors with data on single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with osmotic and oxidative hemolysis in vitro. Mixed modeling accounting for repeated transfusion episodes identified predictors of transfusion effectiveness.RESULTSBlood donor (sex, Rh status, fingerstick hemoglobin, smoking), component (storage duration, \u03b3 irradiation, leukoreduction, apheresis collection, storage solution), and recipient (sex, BMI, race and ethnicity, age) characteristics were associated with hemoglobin and bilirubin, but not creatinine, increments following RBC transfusions. Increased storage duration was associated with increased bilirubin and decreased hemoglobin increments, suggestive of in vivo hemolysis following transfusion. Donor G6PD deficiency and polymorphisms in SEC14L4, HBA2, and MYO9B genes were associated with decreased hemoglobin increments. Donor G6PD deficiency and polymorphisms in SEC14L4 were associated with increased transfusion requirements in the subsequent 48 hours.CONCLUSIONDonor genetic and other factors, such as RBC storage duration, affect transfusion effectiveness as defined by decreased hemoglobin or increased bilirubin increments. Addressing these factors will provide a precision medicine approach to improve patient outcomes, particularly for chronically transfused RBC recipients, who would most benefit from more effective transfusion products.FUNDINGFunding was provided by HHSN 75N92019D00032, HHSN 75N92019D00034, 75N92019D00035, HHSN 75N92019D00036, and HHSN 75N92019D00037; R01HL126130; and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).", "Keywords": ["Clinical practice", "Genetic variation", "Hematology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Donors", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Female", "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency", "Hemoglobins", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nareg H", "Last Name": "Roubinian", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Reese", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Plimier", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, RTI International, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Grier P", "Last Name": "Page", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, RTI International, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ritchard G", "Last Name": "Cable", "Affiliation": "American Red Cross, Farmington, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Custer", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark T", "Last Name": "Gladwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruchika", "Last Name": "Goel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bob", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamir", "Last Name": "Kanias", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Kleinman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Victoria, British Colombia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Mast", "Affiliation": "Versiti Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven R", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan R", "Last Name": "Spencer", "Affiliation": "American Red Cross, Dedham, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Busch", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study IV Pediatrics (REDS-IV-P)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2022Jan11"}, {"PMID": "34726258", "Title": "Red blood cell transfusion-induced non-transferrin-bound iron promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in human sera and mortality in catheterized mice.", "Abstract": "Transfusion of storage-damaged red blood cells (RBCs) increases non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) levels in humans.

Its prevalence is hypothesized to be due to conferring resistance to malaria. However, G6PD deficiency also results in hemolytic sequelae from oxidant stress. Moreover, G6PD deficiency is associated with kidney disease, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, immunological defects, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the only available mouse models have decreased levels of WT stable G6PD caused by promoter mutations. However, human G6PD mutations are missense mutations that result in decreased enzymatic stability. As such, this results in very low activity in red blood cells (RBCs) that cannot synthesize new protein. To generate a more accurate model, the human sequence for a severe form of G6PD deficiency, Med(-), was knocked into the murine G6PD locus. As predicted, G6PD levels were extremely low in RBCs, and deficient mice had increased hemolytic sequelae to oxidant stress. Nonerythroid organs had metabolic changes consistent with mild G6PD deficiency, consistent with what has been observed in humans. Juxtaposition of G6PD-deficient and WT mice revealed altered lipid metabolism in multiple organ systems.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival. A possible explanation is that survivors remained hospitalized at their baseline clinical status.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04359810.FUNDINGAmazon Foundation, Skoll Foundation.",

Among these, a subpopulation of small RBCs, comprising type III echinocytes, spheroechinocytes, and spherocytes and defined as storage-induced microerythrocytes (SMEs), could be rapidly cleared from circulation posttransfusion. We quantified the proportion of SMEs in RBC concentrates from healthy human volunteers and assessed correlation with transfusion recovery, investigated the fate of SMEs upon perfusion through human spleen ex vivo, and explored where and how SMEs are cleared in a mouse model of blood storage and transfusion. In healthy human volunteers, high proportion of SMEs in long-stored RBC concentrates correlated with poor transfusion recovery. When perfused through human spleen, 15% and 61% of long-stored RBCs and SMEs were cleared in 70 minutes, respectively. High initial proportion of SMEs also correlated with high retention of RBCs by perfused human spleen. In the mouse model, SMEs accumulated during storage. Transfusion of long-stored RBCs resulted in reduced posttransfusion recovery, mostly due to SME clearance. After transfusion in mice, long-stored RBCs accumulated predominantly in spleen and were ingested mainly by splenic and hepatic macrophages. In macrophage-depleted mice, splenic accumulation and SME clearance were delayed, and transfusion recovery was improved. In healthy hosts, SMEs were cleared predominantly by macrophages in spleen and liver. When this well-demarcated subpopulation of altered RBCs was abundant in RBC concentrates, transfusion recovery was diminished. SME quantification has the potential to improve blood product quality assessment.

For example, through a combination of steady state measurements and 13C6 15N4-arginine tracing experiments, we report an increase in arginine catabolism into ornithine in humans, suggestive of species-specific arginase 1 activity and nitric oxide synthesis-an observation that may impact the translatability of cardiovascular disease studies carried out in non-human primates (NHPs).

Blood Cells from COVID-19 Patients.", "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 beta coronavirus is the etiological driver of COVID-19 disease, which is primarily characterized by shortness of breath, persistent dry cough, and fever. Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading and metabolic rewiring toward the hexose monophosphate shunt, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be less capable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation/oxidant stress when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and vice versa.", "Keywords": ["AE1", "SARS-CoV-2", "band 3", "erythrocyte", "lipidomics", "metabolomics", "proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Erythrocytes", "Humans", "Lipidomics", "Membrane Lipids", "Membrane Proteins", "Metabolome", "Models, Molecular", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Proteome", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Issaian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ryan C", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of proteome research", "PubDate": "2020Nov06"}, {"PMID": "32992186", "Title": "Red Blood Cell Transfusions and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Low red blood cell (RBC) levels are associated with worse intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes.

The impaired immunity to K. pneumoniae during heightened sRBC disposal was independent of iron acquisition by bacterial siderophores, in that K. pneumoniae mutants lacking siderophore function recapitulated the findings observed with the WT strain. Rather, sRBC disposal induced a liver transcriptomic profile notable for suppression of Stat1 and IFN-related responses during K. pneumoniae sepsis. Excess heme handling by macrophages recapitulated STAT1 suppression during infection that required synergistic NRF1 and NRF2 activation but was independent of heme oxygenase-1 induction. Whereas iron was dispensable, the porphyrin moiety of heme was sufficient to mediate suppression of STAT1-dependent responses in human and mouse macrophages and promoted liver dissemination of K. pneumoniae in vivo.

These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Issaian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryan C", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2020Jun30"}, {"PMID": "32577685", "Title": "Direct diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for prior RNA extraction.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an urgent global need for rapid, point-of-care diagnostic testing.

After 42 days of refrigerated storage, autologous 51-chromium 24-hour posttransfusion RBC recovery (PTR) studies were performed. Metabolomics analyses of these RBC units were also performed.RESULTSThe mean 24-hour PTR for G6PD-deficient subjects was 78.5% \u00b1 8.4% (mean \u00b1 SD), which was significantly lower than that for G6PD-normal RBCs (85.3% \u00b1 3.2%; P = 0.0009). None of the G6PD-normal volunteers (0/27) and 3 G6PD-deficient volunteers (3/10) had PTR results below 75%, a key FDA acceptability criterion for stored donor RBCs. As expected, fresh G6PD-deficient RBCs demonstrated defects in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. During refrigerated storage, G6PD-deficient RBCs demonstrated increased glycolysis, impaired glutathione homeostasis, and increased purine oxidation, as compared with G6PD-normal RBCs. In addition, there were significant correlations between PTR and specific metabolites in these pathways.CONCLUSIONBased on current FDA criteria, RBCs from G6PD-deficient donors would not meet the requirements for storage quality. Metabolomics assessment identified markers of PTR and G6PD deficiency (e.g., pyruvate/lactate ratios), along with potential compensatory pathways that could be leveraged to ameliorate the metabolic needs of G6PD-deficient RBCs.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04081272.FUNDINGThe Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development Program, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant 71590, the National Blood

They are also a critically important component of host defense, protecting against invading pathogens. However, the effects on macrophage biology of acutely ingesting large numbers of RBCs are not completely understood. To investigate this issue, we used a mouse model of RBC transfusion and clearance, which mimics the clinical setting. In this model, transfusions of refrigerator storage-damaged (ie, \"old\") RBCs led to increased erythrophagocytosis by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). This robust erythrophagocytosis induced ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, in RPMs. This was accompanied by increases in reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in vivo, which were reduced by treatment in vitro with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Old RBC transfusions also induced RPM-dependent chemokine expression by splenic Ly6Chi monocytes, which signaled Ly6Chi monocyte migration from bone marrow to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of cell division among remaining splenic RPMs, along with the influx of bone marrow-derived Ly6Chi monocytes, suggests that, following RPM depletion induced by robust erythrophagocytosis, there is a coordinated effort to restore homeostasis of the RPM population by local self-maintenance and contributions from circulating monocytes.

However, it is unclear whether accumulation of intracellular and supernatant hypoxanthine in stored red blood cell units is clinically relevant for transfused recipients. Leukoreduced red blood cells from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-normal or -deficient human volunteers were stored in AS-3 under normoxic, hyperoxic, or hypoxic conditions (with oxygen saturation ranging from <3% to >95%). Red blood cells from healthy human volunteers were also collected at sea level or after 1-7 days at high altitude (>5000 m). Finally, C57BL/6J mouse red blood cells were incubated in vitro with 13C1-aspartate or 13C5-adenosine under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, with or without deoxycoformycin, a purine deaminase inhibitor. Metabolomics analyses were performed on human and mouse red blood cells stored for up to 42 or 14 days, respectively, and correlated with 24 h post-transfusion red blood cell recovery. Hypoxanthine increased in stored red blood cell units as a function of oxygen levels. Stored red blood cells from human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient donors had higher levels of deaminated purines. Hypoxia in vitro and in vivo decreased purine oxidation and enhanced purine salvage reactions in human and mouse red blood cells, which was partly explained by decreased adenosine monophosphate deaminase activity. In addition, hypoxanthine levels negatively correlated with post-transfusion red blood cell recovery in mice and - preliminarily albeit significantly - in humans.

The storage age of transfused RBCs positively correlated with increases in NTBI following transfusion (P<0.001; R2=0.44). No associations between storage duration and changes in the other analytes were observed.ConclusionTransfusion of RBCs into VLBW infants is associated with increased markers of hemolysis and the inflammatory chemokine MCP-1.

Unfortunately, therapeutic iron chelators also have undesired toxicity and may deliver iron to microbes. Here we show that a mutant form (K3Cys) of endogenous lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is filtered by the kidney but can bypass sites of megalin-dependent recapture, resulting in urinary excretion. Because K3Cys maintains recognition of its cognate ligand, the iron siderophore enterochelin, this protein can capture and transport iron even in the acidic conditions of urine. Mutant LCN2 strips iron from transferrin and citrate, and delivers it into the urine. In addition, it removes iron from iron overloaded mice, including models of acquired (iron-dextran or stored red blood cells) and primary (Hfe-/-) iron overload. In each case, the mutants reduce redox activity typical of non-transferrin-bound iron.

Despite ABO matching, RBC transfusions can lead to production of alloantibodies against \"minor\" blood group antigens. Non-ABO alloimmunization is a leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality in the U.S. Despite its clinical importance, little is known about the immunological factors that promote alloimmunization. Prior studies indicate that inflammatory conditions place patients at higher risk for alloimmunization. Additionally, co-exposure to pro-inflammatory pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) promotes alloimmunization in animal models, suggesting that RBC alloimmunization depends on innate immune cell activation. However, the specific innate immune stimuli and sensors that induce a T cell-dependent alloantibody response to transfused RBCs have not been identified. The NLRP3 inflammasome senses chemically diverse PAMPs and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including extracellular ATP and iron-containing heme. We hypothesized that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by endogenous DAMPs from RBCs promotes the alloimmune response to a sterile RBC transfusion.

However, a major complication in transfusion recipients is the generation of antibodies against non-ABO alloantigens on donor RBCs, potentially resulting in hemolysis and renal failure. Long-lived antibody responses typically require CD4(+) T cell help and, in murine transfusion models, alloimmunization requires a spleen. Yet, it is not known how RBC-derived antigens are presented to naive T cells in the spleen. We sought to answer whether splenic dendritic cells (DCs) were essential for T cell priming to RBC alloantigens. Transient deletion of conventional DCs at the time of transfusion or splenic DC preactivation before RBC transfusion abrogated T and B cell responses to allogeneic RBCs, even though transfused RBCs persisted in the circulation for weeks. Although all splenic DCs phagocytosed RBCs and activated RBC-specific CD4(+) T cells in vitro, only bridging channel 33D1(+) DCs were required for alloimmunization in vivo. In contrast, deletion of XCR1(+)CD8(+) DCs did not alter the immune response to RBCs. Our work suggests that blocking the function of one DC subset during a narrow window of time during RBC transfusion could potentially prevent the detrimental immune response that occurs in patients who require lifelong RBC transfusion support.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ABO Blood-Group System", "Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Dendritic Cells", "Erythrocyte Transfusion",

However, G6PD deficiency has not been studied in the Dominican Republic, where many individuals have African ancestry. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Dominican HIV-infected patients and to attempt to develop a cost-effective algorithm for identifying such individuals. To this end, histories, chart reviews, and G6PD testing were performed for 238 consecutive HIV-infected adult clinic patients. The overall prevalence of G6PD deficiency (8.8%) was similar in males (9.3%) and females (8.5%), and higher in Haitians (18%) than Dominicans (6.4%; P = 0.01). By logistic regression, three clinical variables predicted G6PD status: maternal country of birth (P = 0.01) and a history of hemolysis (P = 0.01) or severe anemia (P = 0.03). Using these criteria, an algorithm was developed, in which a patient subset was identified that would benefit most from G6PD screening, yielding a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 97.2%, increasing the pretest probability (8.8-15.1%), and halving the number of patients needing testing.

In a prospective, observational study of critically ill children, we examined the effect of RBC storage duration on the extent of hemolysis by comparing laboratory measurements obtained before, and 4 hr after, RBC transfusion (N\u2009=\u2009100) or saline/albumin infusion (N\u2009=\u200920). Transfusion of RBCs stored for longer than 4 weeks significantly increased plasma free hemoglobin (P\u2009<\u20090.05), indirect bilirubin (P\u2009<\u20090.05), serum iron (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and non-transferrin-bound iron (P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, days of storage duration poorly correlated (R(2) <0.10) with all measured indicators of hemolysis and inflammation. These results suggest that, in critically ill children, most effects of RBC storage duration on post-transfusion hemolysis are overwhelmed by recipient and/or donor factors. Nonetheless, we identified a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u200921) with evidence of considerable extravascular hemolysis (i.e., increased indirect bilirubin \u22650.4 mg/dL). In these patients, transfusion-associated hemolysis was accompanied by increases in circulating non-transferrin-bound iron and free hemoglobin and by an acute phase response, as assessed by an increase in median C-reactive protein levels of 21.2 mg/L (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

The consequences and potential selective advantages of such PFT host limitation have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, PFT ligation of hCD59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing hCD59. Because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, RBCs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. RBC programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on Fas/FasL signaling and RIP1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. Death due to programmed necrosis in RBCs is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, NADPH oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. Bacterial PFTs that are hCD59 independent do not induce RBC programmed necrosis. RBC programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature RBCs.

Children and pregnant women are at highest risk for developing iron deficiency because of their increased iron requirements. Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects on fetal development, including low birth weight, growth retardation, hypertension, intrauterine fetal death, neurologic impairment, and premature birth. We hypothesized that pregnant mice fed an iron-deficient diet would have a similar outcome regarding fetal growth to that of humans. To this end, we randomly assigned female C57BL/6 mice to consume 1 of 4 diets (high-iron-low-bioavailability, high-iron-high-bioavailability, iron-replete, and iron-deficient) for 4 wk before breeding, followed by euthanasia on day 17 to 18 of gestation. Compared with all other groups, dams fed the high-iron-high-bioavailability diet had significantly higher liver iron. Hct and Hgb levels in dams fed the iron-deficient diet were decreased by at least 2.5 g/dL as compared with those of all other groups. In addition, the percentage of viable pups among dams fed the iron-deficient diet was lower than that of all other groups. Finally, compared with all other groups, fetuses from dams fed the iron-deficient diet had lower fetal brain iron levels, shorter crown-rump lengths, and lower weights. In summary, mice fed an iron-deficient diet had similar hematologic values and fetal outcomes as those of iron-deficient humans, making this a useful model for studying iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Body Weight", "Female", "Fertility", "Fetal Development", "Hematocrit", "Hemoglobins", "Iron Deficiencies", "Iron, Dietary", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea C", "Last Name": "Hubbard", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Institute of Comparative Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA. ah2911@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Bandyopadhyay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Boguslaw S", "Last Name": "Wojczyk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin A", "Last Name": "Prestia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Comparative medicine", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23294207", "Title": "Cold case: the missing human inflammatory cytokine response to transfusion.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cryopreservation", "Cytokines", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transfusion", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23033973", "Title": "Resistance of a subset of red blood cells to clearance by antibodies in a mouse model of incompatible transfusion.", "Abstract": "Alloimmunization to antigens on transfused red blood cells (RBCs) represents a major barrier to chronic transfusion.
