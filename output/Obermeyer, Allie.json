Complex coacervation is also being explored as a potential protein purification method due to its potential scalability, aqueous operation, and ability to produce a highly concentrated product. However, to date most studies of complex coacervation have evaluated the phase behavior of a binary mixture of two oppositely charged macromolecules. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the phase behavior of complex biological mixtures has yet to be established. To address this, a panel of engineered proteins was designed to allow for quantitative analysis of the complex coacervation of individual proteins within a multi-component mixture. The behavior of individual proteins was evaluated using a defined mixture of proteins that mimics the charge profile of the E. coli proteome. To allow for direct quantification of proteins in each phase, spectrally separated fluorescent proteins were used to construct the protein mixture. From this quantitative analysis, we observed that the coacervation behavior of individual proteins in the mixture was consistent with each other, which was distinctive from the behavior when each protein was evaluated in a single-protein system. Subtle differences in biophysical properties between the proteins became noticeable in the mixture, which allowed us to elucidate parameters for protein complex coacervation. With this understanding, we successfully designed methods to enrich a range of proteins of interest from a mixture of proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "So Yeon", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Allie C", "Last Name": "Obermeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr03"}, {"PMID": "38308651", "Title": "Charge-Patterned Disordered Peptides Tune Intracellular Phase Separation in Bacteria.", "Abstract": "Subcellular phase-separated compartments, known as biomolecular condensates, play an important role in the spatiotemporal organization of cells. To understand the sequence-determinants of phase separation in bacteria, we engineered protein-based condensates in Escherichia coli using electrostatic interactions as the main driving force. Minimal cationic disordered peptides were used to supercharge negative, neutral, and positive globular model proteins, enabling their phase separation with anionic biomacromolecules in the cell. The phase behavior was governed by the interaction strength between the cationic proteins and anionic biopolymers, in addition to the protein concentration. The interaction strength primarily depended on the overall net charge of the protein, but the distribution of charge between the globular and disordered domains also had an impact. Notably, the protein charge distribution between domains could tune mesoscale attributes such as the size, number, and subcellular localization of condensates within E. coli cells. The length and charge density of the disordered peptides had significant effects on protein expression levels, ultimately influencing the formation of condensates.

Here we investigated the complex coacervation of anionic proteins with a block copolymer of opposite charge to form polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) micelles for use as a protein delivery vehicle. Using genetically modified variants of the model protein green fluorescent protein (GFP), we evaluated the role of protein charge and charge localization in the formation and stability of PEC micelles.

We found that isotropically supercharged proteins formed micelles at higher ionic strength relative to protein variants with charge localized to a polypeptide tag. We then studied GFP delivery by PEC micelles and found that they effectively delivered the protein cargo to mammalian cells. However, cellular delivery varied as a function of protein charge and charge distribution and we found an inverse relationship between the PEC micelle critical salt concentration and delivery efficiency.

In particular, hexagonal phases are only observed for proteins within the molar mass range 20-36 kDa, where ordering quality is also significantly enhanced. While ordering is generally found to improve with increasing molecular weight outside of this range, most large bioconjugates exhibited weaker than predicted assembly, which is attributed to chain entanglement with increasing polymer molecular weight.

Complex coacervation of ampholytic proteins with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is of increasing interest as it results in a protein rich phase that has potential applications in protein therapeutics, protein purification, and biocatalysis. However, many globular proteins do not phase separate when mixed with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte, and those that do phase separate do so over narrow concentration, pH, and ionic strength ranges. The protein design factors that govern complex coacervation under varying conditions are still relatively unexplored. Recent work indicates that proteins with an intrinsically disordered region, a higher net charge, or a patch of charged residues are more likely to undergo a phase transition. Based on these design parameters, polyionic coacervation tags were designed and assessed for their ability to promote protein complex coacervation with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The phase behavior of a panel of engineered proteins was evaluated with the strong polycation poly(4-vinyl N-methyl pyridinium iodide). Proteins containing the ionic tags formed liquid coacervate droplets, while isotropically charged protein variants formed solid precipitates. The ionic tags also promoted phase separation at higher salt concentrations than an isotropic distribution of charge on the protein surface. The salt dependence of the protein complex coacervation could be predicted independently for tagged or isotropic variants by the ratio of negative-to-positive residues on the proteins and universally by calculating the distance between like charges. The addition of just a six residue polyionic tag generated a globular protein capable of liquid-liquid phase separation at physiological pH and ionic strength.

In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in protein-containing PECs, with an overall goal of defining relevant design parameters for macro- and microphase separated PECs.

Unlike classical organelles, membraneless organelles possess no physical barrier but rather arise by phase separation of the organelle components from the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. Complex coacervation, the liquid-liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, is one of several phenomena that are hypothesized to drive the formation and regulation of some membraneless organelles. Studies of the molecular properties of globular proteins that drive complex coacervation are limited as many proteins do not form complexes with oppositely charged macromolecules at neutral pH and moderate ionic strengths. Protein supercharging overcomes this problem and drives complexation with oppositely charged macromolecules. In this work, several distinct cationic supercharged green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants were designed to examine the phase behavior with oppositely charged polyanionic macromolecules. Cationic GFP variants phase separated with oppositely charged macromolecules at various mixing ratios, salt concentrations, and pH values. Efficient protein incorporation in the macromolecule rich phase occurred over a range of protein and polymer mass fractions, but the protein encapsulation efficiency was highest at the midpoint of the phase separation regime. More positively charged proteins phase separated over broader pH and salt ranges than those of proteins with a lower charge density. Interestingly, each GFP variant phase separated at higher salt concentrations with anionic synthetic macromolecules compared to anionic biological macromolecules. Optical microscopy revealed that most variants, depending on solution conditions, formed liquid-liquid phase separations, except for GFP/DNA pairs that formed solid aggregates under all tested conditions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chromatography, Affinity", "Escherichia coli", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Liquid-Liquid Extraction", "Osmolar Concentration", "Polyelectrolytes", "Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chad S", "Last Name": "Cummings", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Allie C", "Last Name": "Obermeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2018Jan23"}, {"PMID": "28029202", "Title": "Three-Dimensional Ordered Antibody Arrays Through Self-Assembly of Antibody-Polymer Conjugates.", "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) ordered arrays of human immunoglobulin\u2005G (IgG) were fabricated using well-defined full-length antibody-polymer conjugates (APCs).

Thus, a technology that can perform on-site decontamination in a safe and timely fashion is desirable. Here, complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms) were used to encapsulate organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) and chemostabilize it to maintain activity after exposure to organophosphate simulants ethanol and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). C3Ms were formed by two polymers-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate)-b-poly(4-vinyl N-methylpyridyl iodide), (POEGMA-b-qP4VP). Complexes of the coacervate micelles with the enzyme OPH were investigated by small angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), demonstrating the formation of micellar structures in solution. The activity of OPH against methyl paraoxon in these C3Ms under aqueous conditions was assayed after heat treatment for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C. The OPH in C3Ms retained 88 \u00b1 7% of its initial activity, as compared to the 48 \u00b1 3% activity retained by OPH alone, indicating that the C3Ms were able to stabilize the enzyme to heat treatment. C3Ms transferred into the two organic solvents formed larger structures than inverse micelles formed by the block copolymer alone. The addition of OPH to the C3Ms in organic solvents did not significantly change their structure. The activity of OPH (again, against methyl paraoxon) after 24 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C was measured and compared to that of OPH in C3Ms. While OPH alone retained less than 5% of its activity after this incubation in both solvents, OPH in C3Ms retained 35 \u00b1 3% of its activity in DMMP and 26 \u00b1 1% of its activity in ethanol.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Micelles", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Polymers", "Solvents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carolyn E", "Last Name": "Mills", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Allie", "Last Name": "Obermeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xuehui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bradley D", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts02139, United States."}], "Journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "PubDate": "2016Dec20"}, {"PMID": "27447346", "Title": "Direct detection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins using an aniline-based oxidative coupling strategy.", "Abstract": "A convenient two-step method is described for the detection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins.

Four model proteins were anionically supercharged to varying degrees as quantified by mass spectrometry. Proteins phase separated with strong polycations when the ratio of negatively charged residues to positively charged residues on the protein (\u03b1) was greater than 1.1-1.2. Efficient partitioning of the protein into the coacervate phase required larger \u03b1 (1.5-2.0).
