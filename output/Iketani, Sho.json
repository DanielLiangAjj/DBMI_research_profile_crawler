The scientific response has been rapid and effective, with many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecules developed for clinical use.

Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the resistance profile for each of these therapeutics.

Reassuringly, BA.2.86 was no more resistant to human sera than the currently dominant XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1, indicating that the new subvariant would not have a growth advantage in this regard. Importantly, sera from people who had XBB breakthrough infection exhibited robust neutralizing activity against all viruses tested, suggesting that upcoming XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines could confer added protection.

As an RNA virus characterized by high mutation rates, whether SARS-CoV-2 will develop resistance to nirmatrelvir is a question of concern. Our previous studies have shown that several mutational pathways confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, but some result in a loss of viral replicative fitness, which is then compensated\u00a0for by additional alterations3. The molecular mechanisms for this observed resistance are\u00a0unknown. Here we combined biochemical and structural methods to demonstrate that alterations at the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro can allow SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance to nirmatrelvir in two distinct ways. Comprehensive studies of the\u00a0structures of\u00a014 Mpro mutants\u00a0in complex with drugs or substrate revealed that alterations at the S1 and S4 subsites substantially decreased\u00a0the level of inhibitor binding, whereas alterations at the S2 and S4' subsites unexpectedly increased protease activity. Both mechanisms contributed to nirmatrelvir resistance, with\u00a0the latter compensating for the loss in enzymatic activity of the former, which in turn accounted for the restoration of viral replicative fitness, as observed previously3. Such a profile was also observed for ensitrelvir, another clinically relevant Mpro inhibitor. These results shed light on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evolves to develop resistance to the current generation of protease inhibitors and provide the basis for the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antiviral Agents", "COVID-19", "Lactams", "Leucine", "Nitriles", "SARS-CoV-2", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Binding Sites", "Mutation",

Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. IMPORTANCE The neutralizing capacities of monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 and of those recovered from previously infected and vaccinated individuals against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) remain important questions. We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. We note high attack rates with symptoms in nearly 50% of infected individuals, in sharp contrast to an unrelated institutional outbreak caused by the R.1 variant among a vaccinated population. We found little evidence of significant community spillover.

Numerous efforts have been placed on the development of therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. One particular target is the 3CL protease (3CL pro ), which holds promise as it is essential to the virus and highly conserved among coronaviruses, suggesting that it may be possible to find broad inhibitors that treat not just SARS-CoV-2 but other coronavirus infections as well. While the 3CL protease has been studied by many groups for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, our understanding of its tolerance to mutations is limited, knowledge which is particularly important as 3CL protease inhibitors become utilized clinically. Here, we develop a yeast-based deep mutational scanning approach to systematically profile the activity of all possible single mutants of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , and validate our results both in yeast and in authentic viruses. We reveal that the 3CL pro is highly malleable and is capable of tolerating mutations throughout the protein, including within the substrate binding pocket. Yet, we also identify specific residues that appear immutable for function of the protease, suggesting that these interactions may be novel targets for the design of future 3CL pro inhibitors. Finally, we utilize our screening results as a basis to identify E166V as a resistance-conferring mutation against the therapeutic 3CL pro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, in clinical use. Collectively, the functional map presented herein may serve as a guide for further understanding of the biological properties of the 3CL protease and for drug development for current and future coronavirus pandemics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seo Jung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Farideh", "Last Name": "Bahari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Culbertson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fereshteh Fallah", "Last Name": "Atanaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arjun K", "Last Name": "Aditham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander F", "Last Name": "Kratz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria I", "Last Name": "Luck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruxiao", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hesam", "Last Name": "Montazeri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yosef", "Last Name": "Sabo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2022Jul12"}, {"PMID": "35790190", "Title": "Antibody evasion by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5.", "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 have surged notably to become dominant in the United States and South Africa, respectively1,2.

"The identification of the Omicron (B.1.1.529.1 or BA.1) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Botswana in November 20211 immediately caused concern owing to the number of alterations in the spike glycoprotein that could lead to antibody evasion. We2 and others3-6 recently reported results confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of the evolution of Omicron has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K alteration (BA.1+R346K, also known as BA.1.1) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike alterations and lacking 13 spike alterations found in BA.1. Here we extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.1 (refs. 2,3,5,6). These findings indicate that these three sublineages of Omicron are antigenically equidistant from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and thus similarly threaten the efficacies of current vaccines. BA.2 also exhibited marked resistance to 17 of 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested, including S309 (sotrovimab)7, which had retained appreciable activity against BA.1 and BA.1+R346K (refs. 2-4,6). This finding shows that no authorized monoclonal antibody therapy could adequately cover all sublineages of the Omicron variant, except for the recently authorized LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jasper F-W", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Yiming", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maple", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hin", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Kenn K-H", "Last Name": "Chik", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Terrence T-T", "Last Name": "Yuen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena E", "Last Name": "Sobieszczyk", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwok-Yung", "Last Name": "Yuen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. dh2994@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "35016198", "Title": "Striking antibody evasion manifested by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.", "Abstract": "The B.1.1.529/Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was only recently detected in southern Africa, but its subsequent spread has been extensive, both regionally and globally1. It is expected to become dominant in the coming weeks2, probably due to enhanced transmissibility. A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings of our study. Here we found that B.1.1.529 is markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals who were vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from individuals who were vaccinated and received a booster dose of mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies against all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 out of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones that are currently authorized or approved for use in patients. Moreover, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance on B.1.1.529.

Cells from Protease-Mediated Cytotoxicity.", "Abstract": "We describe a mammalian cell-based assay to identify coronavirus 3CL protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identified compounds with broad 3CLpro-inhibitory activity. We also adapted the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncovered additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CLpro inhibitors. We observed strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live-virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identified two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested, including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last 2 decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We developed and validated a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins-the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN's dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4\u00a0days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.IMPORTANCE Human parainfluenza virus 3 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Using deep genomic sequencing of HPIV-3-positive clinical material and its subsequent viral isolate, we discover a number of known and novel coding mutations in the main HPIV-3 attachment protein HN during brief exposure to immortalized cells. These mutations significantly alter function of the fusion complex, increasing fusion promotion by HN as well as generally decreasing neuraminidase activity and increasing HN-receptor engagement.

Canine and feline parvovirus capsids bind the transferrin receptor type 1 (TfR) to enter host cells, and specific structural interactions appear necessary to prepare the stable capsids for infection. Here, we define the details of binding, competition, and occupancy of wild-type and mutant parvovirus capsids with purified receptors and antibodies. TfR-capsid binding interactions depended on the TfR species and varied widely, with no direct relationship between binding affinity and infection. Capsids bound feline, raccoon, and black-backed jackal TfRs at high affinity but barely bound canine TfRs, which mediated infection efficiently. TfRs from different species also occupied capsids to different levels, with an estimated 1 to 2 feline TfRs but 12 black-backed jackal TfRs binding each capsid. Multiple alanine substitutions within loop 1 on the capsid surface reduced TfR binding but substitutions within loop 3 did not, suggesting that loop 1 directly engaged the TfR and loop 3 sterically affected that interaction. Binding and competition between different TfRs and/or antibodies showed complex relationships. Both antibodies 14 and E competed capsids off TfRs, but antibody E could also compete capsids off itself and antibody 14, likely by inducing capsid structural changes. In some cases, the initial TfR or antibody binding event affected subsequent TfR binding, suggesting that capsid structure changes occur after TfR or antibody binding and may impact infection. This shows that precise, host-specific TfR-capsid interactions, beyond simple attachment, are important for successful infection.IMPORTANCE Host receptor binding is a key step during viral infection and may control both infection and host range. In addition to binding, some viruses require specific interactions with host receptors in order to infect, and anti-capsid antibodies can potentially disrupt these interactions, leading to neutralization. Here, we examine the interactions between parvovirus capsids, the receptors from different hosts, and anti-capsid antibodies. We show that interactions between parvovirus capsids and host-specific TfRs vary in both affinity and in the numbers of receptors bound, with complex effects on infection. In addition, antibodies binding to two sites on the capsids had different effects on TfR-capsid binding.

The footprint identified was significantly different from the footprint obtained previously from models fitted into lower-resolution maps.
