To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template.

Upon cell cycle-dependent activation, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate resection proteins and thereby stimulate end resection and repair by homologous recombination (HR). However, inability of CDK phospho-mimetic mutants to bypass this cell cycle regulation, suggests that additional cell cycle regulators may be important.

Using inducible genetic and chemical inhibition of DDK in budding yeast and human cells, we show that end resection and HR require activation by DDK.

Instead of utilizing a canonical replication fork, BIR is driven by a migrating D-loop and is associated with a high frequency of mutagenesis. Here we show that when BIR encounters an interstitial telomere sequence (ITS), the machinery frequently terminates, resulting in the formation of an ectopic telomere. The primary mechanism to convert the ITS to a functional telomere is by telomerase-catalyzed addition of telomeric repeats with homology-directed repair serving as a back-up mechanism. Termination of BIR and creation of an ectopic telomere is promoted by Mph1/FANCM helicase, which has the capacity to disassemble D-loops. Other sequences that have the potential to seed new telomeres but lack the unique features of a natural telomere sequence, do not terminate BIR at a significant frequency in wild-type cells. However, these sequences can form ectopic telomeres if BIR is made less processive.

Galactose induction requires cell cultivation in suboptimal growth media, which is tedious especially when working with slow growing DSB repair mutants.

Here, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids conserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family.

Here we will discuss several models that have been proposed to explain the mechanism of mitotic recombination, the genes and proteins involved in various pathways, the genetic and physical assays used to discover and study these genes, and the roles of many of these proteins inside the cell.", "Keywords": ["budding yeast", "recombination", "repair"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Damage", "DNA, Fungal", "Genetic Techniques", "Mitosis", "Recombination, Genetic", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorraine S", "Last Name": "Symington", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Lisby", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2014Nov"}, {"PMID": "25231858", "Title": "DNA repair: Making the cut.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endodeoxyribonucleases", "Endonucleases", "Exodeoxyribonucleases", "Homologous Recombination", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorraine S", "Last Name": "Symington", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Oct02"}, {"PMID": "25184562", "Title": "DNA repair mechanisms and their biological roles in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.", "Abstract": "Research into the complex genetic underpinnings of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is entering a new era with the arrival of site-specific genome engineering. Previously restricted only to model systems but now expanded to most laboratory organisms, and even to humans for experimental gene therapy studies, this technology allows researchers to rapidly generate previously unattainable genetic modifications. This technological advance is dependent on DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR), specifically homologous recombination in the case of Plasmodium. Our understanding of DSBR in malaria parasites, however, is based largely on assumptions and knowledge taken from other model systems, which do not always hold true in Plasmodium. Here we describe the causes of double-strand breaks, the mechanisms of DSBR, and the differences between model systems and P. falciparum. These mechanisms drive basic parasite functions, such as meiosis, antigen diversification, and copy number variation, and allow the parasite to continually evolve in the contexts of host immune pressure and drug selection.

It is performed by transformation with a linear, non-replicative DNA fragment carrying a selectable marker and containing ends homologous to the particular locus in a genome. However, even in S. cerevisiae, transformation can result in unwanted (aberrant) integration events, the frequency and spectra of which are quite different for ends-out and ends-in transformation assays. It has been observed that gene replacement (ends-out gene targeting) can result in illegitimate integration, integration of the transforming DNA fragment next to the target sequence and duplication of a targeted chromosome. By contrast, plasmid integration (ends-in gene targeting) is often associated with multiple targeted integration events but illegitimate integration is extremely rare and a targeted chromosome duplication has not been reported. Here we systematically investigated the influence of design of the ends-out assay on the success of targeted genetic modification. We have determined transformation efficiency, fidelity of gene targeting and spectra of all aberrant events in several ends-out gene targeting assays designed to insert, delete or replace a particular sequence in the targeted region of the yeast genome. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that targeted chromosome duplications occur even during ends-in gene targeting. Most importantly, the whole chromosome duplication is POL32 dependent pointing to break-induced replication (BIR) as the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the occurrence of duplication of the targeted chromosome was strikingly increased in the exo1\u0394 sgs1\u0394 double mutant but not in the respective single mutants demonstrating that the Exo1 and Sgs1 proteins independently suppress whole chromosome duplication during gene targeting.", "Keywords": ["Break-induced replication", "Ends-in", "Ends-out", "Gene targeting", "Homologous recombination", "Whole chromosome duplication"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosome Duplication", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Replication", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Exodeoxyribonucleases", "Gene Targeting", "Homologous Recombination", "RecQ Helicases", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anamarija", "Last Name": "\u0160tafa", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Biology and Microbial Genetics, Department of Biochemical Engineering, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, University of Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Cdc14 activation at\u00a0anaphase triggers nuclear accumulation and enzymatic activation of Yen1, likely to resolve persistent recombinational repair intermediates.
