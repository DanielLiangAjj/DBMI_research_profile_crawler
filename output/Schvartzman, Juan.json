The effects of 2HG have been reported to sensitize IDH tumors to poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. However, unlike PARP-inhibitor-sensitive BRCA1/2 tumors, which exhibit impaired homologous recombination, IDH-mutant tumors have a silent mutational profile and lack signatures associated with impaired homologous recombination. Instead, 2HG-producing IDH mutations lead to a heterochromatin-dependent slowing of DNA replication accompanied by increased replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks. This replicative stress manifests as replication fork slowing, but the breaks are repaired without a significant increase in mutation burden. Faithful resolution of replicative stress in IDH-mutant cells is dependent on poly-(ADP-ribosylation). Treatment with PARP inhibitors increases DNA replication but results in incomplete DNA repair. These findings demonstrate a role for PARP in the replication of heterochromatin and further validate PARP as a therapeutic target in IDH-mutant tumors.", "Keywords": ["PARP", "dioxygenase", "heterochromatin", "isocitrate dehydrogenase", "oncometabolite", "replication stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "BRCA1 Protein", "Heterochromatin", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "BRCA2 Protein", "Homologous Recombination", "Neoplasms", "Mutation", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juan-Manuel", "Last Name": "Schvartzman", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Clinical data were obtained. By slide review, blinded to IDH status, data were collected for histology type, mucin production, necrosis, fibrosis, cytoplasm cell shape (low cuboidal, plump cuboidal/polygonal, and columnar), and architectural pattern (anastomosing, tubular, compact tubular, and solid). A tumor was considered architecturally heterogeneous if no dominant pattern represented \u226575% of the tumor. Parameters were compared between mIDH1and IDH wild-type controls. In the examined cohort (113 ICC: 29 mIDH1 and 84 IDH wild-type), all IDH1-mutant tumors were of small duct-type histology, thus analysis was limited to 101 small duct-type tumors. mIDH1cases were more likely to have plump cuboidal/polygonal shape (P\u202f=\u202f.014) and geographic-type fibrosis (P\u202f=\u202f.005), while IDH1 wild-type were more likely to have low cuboidal shape (P\u202f=\u202f.005).

Isoform-selective IDH inhibitors suppress 2HG production and induce clinical responses in patients with IDH1- and IDH2-mutant malignancies. Despite the promising activity of IDH inhibitors, the mechanisms that mediate resistance to IDH inhibition are poorly understood. Here, we describe four clinical cases that identify mutant IDH isoform switching, either from mutant IDH1 to mutant IDH2 or vice versa, as a mechanism of acquired clinical resistance to IDH inhibition in solid and liquid tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: IDH-mutant cancers can develop resistance to isoform-selective IDH inhibition by \"isoform switching\" from mutant IDH1 to mutant IDH2 or vice versa, thereby restoring 2HG production by the tumor. These findings underscore a role for continued 2HG production in tumor progression and suggest therapeutic strategies to prevent or overcome resistance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue
