[{"PMID": "38773556", "Title": "Targeting miR-181a/b in retinitis pigmentosa: implications for disease progression and therapy.", "Abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous group of degenerative disorders causing progressive vision loss due to photoreceptor death. RP affects other retinal cells, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). MicroRNAs (miRs) are implicated in RP pathogenesis, and downregulating miR-181a/b has shown therapeutic benefit in RP mouse models by improving mitochondrial function. This study investigates the expression profile of miR-181a/b in RPE cells and the neural retina during RP disease progression. We also evaluate how miR-181a/b downregulation, by knocking out miR-181a/b-1 cluster in RPE cells, confers therapeutic efficacy in an RP mouse model and explore the mechanisms underlying this process.", "Keywords": ["Aerobic glycolysis", "Metabolic reprogramming", "MicroRNAs", "Retinal pigment epithelium", "Retinitis pigmentosa"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bruna Lopes da", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter M J", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen-Hsuan", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas D", "Last Name": "Nolan", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aykut", "Last Name": "Demirkol", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yi-Ting", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore Marco", "Last Name": "Caruso", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thiago", "Last Name": "Cabral", "Affiliation": "Department of Specialized Medicine, CCS and Vision Center Unit, Ophthalmology EBSERH, HUCAM/CCS, UFES-Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo (UFES), Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care (JCVC) and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA. sht2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cell & bioscience", "PubDate": "2024May21"}, {"PMID": "38703176", "Title": "Unusual Retinal Hemorrhages in a Highly Myopic Patient.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kai-Lan", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shawn H", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Optometry, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City, Taiwan."}], "Journal": "Ophthalmology.

The study uses a homologous protein antigen as a functional scaffold to generate a ChA possessing four epitopes from transferrin-binding protein A of Glaesserella parasuis. Our engineered strain, which co-expresses P17 tagged-ChA and endogenous chaperones groEL-ES, yields a 0.346\u2009g/L highly soluble ChA with the property of HPS-positive serum reaction. Moreover, the protein titer of ChA reaches 4.27\u2009g/L with >90% soluble proportion in 5-L bioreactor, which is the highest titer reported so far.

Electroretinography (ERG) is a diagnostic tool that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light stimuli, and it can help to determine the function of these cells. A normal ERG response consists of two waves, the a-wave and the b-wave, which reflect the activity of the photoreceptor cells and the bipolar and Muller cells, respectively. Despite the growing availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, identifying the precise genetic mutation causing an IRD can be challenging and costly. However, certain types of IRDs present with unique ERG features that can help guide genetic testing. By combining these ERG findings with other clinical information, such as on family history and retinal imaging, physicians can effectively narrow down the list of candidate genes to be sequenced, thereby reducing the cost of genetic testing. This review article focuses on certain types of IRDs with unique ERG features. We will discuss the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of, and ERG findings on, these disorders, emphasizing the unique role ERG plays in their diagnosis and genetic testing.", "Keywords": ["X-linked retinoschisis", "cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response", "cone\u2013rod dystrophies", "congenital stationary night blindness", "electronegative ERG", "electroretinography", "enhanced S-cone syndrome", "fundus albipunctatus", "inherited retinal dystrophies"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tsai-Hsuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Education, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan 33305, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Eugene Yu-Chuan", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan 33305, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Hsuan", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "National Taiwan University Hospital, Yunlin 640203, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Liang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

OPA13 is caused by heterozygous mutation in the SSBP1 gene, associated with variable mitochondrial dysfunctions. Results: We have previously reported a 16-year-old Taiwanese male diagnosed with OPA13 and SSBP1 variant c.320G>A (p.Arg107Gln) was identified by whole exon sequence (WES). This variant was assumed to be de novo since his parents were clinically unaffected. However, WES and Sanger sequencing further revealed the proband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unaffected mother carrying the same SSBP1 variant with a 13% variant allele frequency (VAF) in her peripheral blood. That finding strongly indicates the maternal gonosomal mosaicism contributing to OPA13, which has not been reported before.

Patient data were sourced from the multi-institutional Chang Gung Research Database. Participants were divided into groups based on treatment with bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept. Baseline characteristics were matched among the groups by the inverse probability of treatment weighting. The incidence rate of outcome events was calculated as the number of events divided by 100 person-years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence function was used to estimate the incidence rate of the outcome events among groups. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher in the ranibizumab group than the bevacizumab and aflibercept groups (1.65, 0.92, and 0.61 per 100 person-years, respectively). The incidence of major adverse lower-limb events was higher in the bevacizumab group (2.95), followed by ranibizumab (2.00) and aflibercept (0.74). Major bleeding was relatively higher in bevacizumab (12.1) compared to ranibizumab (4.3) and aflibercept (3.8). All-cause death was higher for both bevacizumab (3.26) and aflibercept (2.61) when compared to ranibizumab (0.55), and all-cause admission was found to be highest with bevacizumab (58.6), followed by aflibercept (30.2), and ranibizumab (27.6). The bevacizumab group demonstrated a greater decrease in glycated hemoglobin compared to the baseline level (-0.33%). However, a few differences in the clinical condition between the groups were still observed after matching.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is highly prevalent in East Asian countries, with an increasing incidence recently worldwide. This retrospective study investigates infection sources and antibiotic susceptibilities of K. pneumoniae in patients with endogenous K. pneumoniae endophthalmitis (EKE) in Northern Taiwan. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with EKE were reviewed between January 1996 and April 2019. Pyogenic liver abscess (120/157, 76.4%) was the most common infection source, followed by pneumonia (13, 8.3%), urinary tract infection (7, 4.5%), and intravenous drug use (4, 2.5%). Bilateral involvement was identified in 12.1% (19/157) of patients, especially in patients with pyogenic liver abscess (16/120, 13.3%), pneumonia (2/13, 15.4%), and urinary tract infection (1/7, 14.3%). The antibiotic susceptibility rates were 98.1%, 92.5%, 97.5%, 96.8%, 100%, 99.3%, and 100% for amikacin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, respectively. Four extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae isolates were identified. In conclusion, pyogenic liver abscess was the major infection source in EKE.

It is characterized by visual field defects and progressive optic nerve atrophy. The underlying pathophysiology and mechanisms of RGC degeneration in several ocular diseases remain largely unknown. RGCs are a population of central nervous system neurons, with their soma located in the retina and long axons that extend through the optic nerve to form distal terminals and connections in the brain. Because of this unique cytoarchitecture and highly compartmentalized energy demand, RGCs are highly mitochondrial-dependent for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Recently, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been found to be the principal mechanisms in RGC degeneration as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we review the role of oxidative stress in several ocular diseases associated with RGC degenerations, including glaucoma, hereditary optic atrophy, inflammatory optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, traumatic optic neuropathy, and drug toxicity.

Ret mutant mice show abnormal retinal activity and abnormal levels and morphology of bipolar cells, yet die on the 21st day after birth as a result of renal underdevelopment. To extend the observation period, we generated the Ret conditional knockout Chx10-Cre;C-Ret lx/lx  mouse model and analyzed the retinal function and morphological changes in mature and aging Chx10-Cre;C-Ret lx/lx  mice. Methods: Retina-specific depletion of Ret was achieved using mice with floxed alleles of the Ret gene with CHX10-driven Cre recombinase; floxed mice without Cre expression were used as controls. Retinal function was examined using electroretinography (ERG), and 2-, 4-, 12-, and 24-month-old mice were analyzed by hematoxylin staining and immunohistochemistry to evaluate retinal morphological alterations. The ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was evaluated using electron microscopy. Results: The results of the ERG testing showed that b-wave amplitudes were reduced in Chx10-Cre;C-Ret lx/lx  mice, whereas a-waves were not affected. A histopathological analysis revealed a thinner and disorganized outer plexiform layer at the ages of 12 and 24 months in Chx10-Cre;C-Ret lx/lx  mice. Moreover, the data provided by immunohistochemistry showed defects in the synapses of photoreceptor cells. This result was confirmed at the ultrastructural level, thus supporting the participation of Ret in the morphological changes of the synaptic ribbon. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of the role of Ret in maintaining the function of the retina, which was essential for preserving the structure of the synaptic ribbon and supporting the integrity of the outer plexiform layer.", "Keywords": ["Cre-loxP knockout mice", "GDNF family of ligands (GFL)", "mouse retina", "rearranged during transfection (RET)", "ribbon synapses"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei-Hao", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine for International Students, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Meng-Lin", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Wan-Chun", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Kang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Sarah R", "Last Name": "Levi", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

This model demonstrated that only 20% of CNGA3 levels in homozygotes derived from target ES cells remained, as compared to normal CNGA3 levels.

The retrospective study is to investigate the in vitro susceptibility to the antibiotics vancomycin, amikacin, and ceftazidime of bacterial endophthalmitis isolates in specimens at a tertiary referral center from January 1996 to April 2019 in Taiwan. Overall, 450 (49.9%) isolates were Gram positive, 447 (49.6%) were Gram negative, and 4 (0.4%) were Gram variable. In Gram-positive isolates, coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most commonly cultured bacteria (158, 35.1%), followed by Streptococci (100, 22.2%), Enterococci (75, 16.7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (70, 15.6%). In Gram-negative isolates, they were Klebsiella pneumoniae (166, 37.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (131, 29.3%). All Gram-positive organisms were susceptible to vancomycin, with the exception of one Enterococcus faecium isolate (1/450, 0.2%). Of the Gram-negative isolates, 96.9% and 93.7% were susceptible to ceftazidime and amikacin, respectively. Nine isolates (9/447, 2.0%) were multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, comprising K. pneumoniae (4/164, 2.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (2/3, 67%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (3/18, 17%). In conclusion, in vitro susceptibility testing revealed that vancomycin remains the suitable antibiotic treatment for Gram-positive endophthalmitis. Ceftazidime and amikacin provide approximately the same degree of Gram-negative coverage.

All the factors examined had significant proliferative effects on cultured M\u00fcller cells (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). A two-well Ibidi silicone culture insert was used to assess M\u00fcller cell migration. M\u00fcller cells cultured in EGF, FGF, IGF-1, collagen IV, and laminin but not in SDF, PDGF, or fibronectin effectively increased the cell migratory activity (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, combined EGF and collagen IV, combined FGF and collagen IV, and combined IGF-1 and laminin exhibited more significant (p\u00a0< .001) effects on M\u00fcller cell migration compared with culture a single factor.

The genetic heterogeneity of RP necessitates a broad therapy that is able to provide treatment in a gene- and mutation- non-specific manner. In this study, we identify the therapeutic benefits of metabolic reprogramming by targeting pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in a Pde6\u03b2 preclinical model of RP. The genetic contributions of PKM2 inhibition in retinal degeneration were evaluated through histology and electroretinogram (ERG) followed by a statistical analysis using a linear regression model. Notably, PKM2 ablation resulted in thicker retinal layers in Pde6\u03b2-mutated mice as compared to the controls, suggesting greater photoreceptor survival. Consistent with these anatomical findings, ERG analyses revealed that the maximum b-wave is on average greater in Pkm2 knockout mice than in mice with intact Pkm2, indicating enhanced photoreceptor function. These rescue phenotypes from Pkm2 ablation in a preclinical model of RP indicate that a metabolome reprogramming may be useful in treating RP.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "Pyruvate Kinase", "Retina", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinitis Pigmentosa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ethan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Edward S.

the high metabolic demand of rods has been implicated in the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of adult blindness in the developed world. The majority of AMD-associated severe vision loss cases are due to exudative AMD, characterized by neovascularization. To further investigate the causes and histopathology of exudative AMD, we conditionally induced hypoxia in a novel preclinical AMD model (Pde6gcreERT2/+;Vhl-/-) by targeting Vhl and used multimodal imaging and immunohistochemistry to track the development of hypoxia-induced neovascularization. In addition to developing a preclinical model that phenocopies exudative AMD, our studies revealed that the photoreceptor hypoxic response initiates and drives type 3 neovascularization, mainly in the outer retina. Activation of the VHL-HIF1a-VEGF-EPO pathway in the adult retina led to long-term neovascularization, retinal hemorrhages and compromised retinal layers. Our novel preclinical model would accelerate the testing of therapies that use metabolomic approaches to ameliorate AMD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Erythropoietin", "Hypoxia", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Macular Degeneration", "Mice", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Shanxi Eye Hospital, affiliated with Shanxi Medical University.

Research Design and Methods: This retrospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of 224 patients with T1DM for >10 years (mean duration 12.6 years) included participants from the Chang Gung Juvenile Diabetes Eye Study Group. The patients received a T1DM diagnosis before the age of 18 years and were treated at the pediatric endocrine department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. The epidemiological and laboratory data such as age, sex, duration of diabetes, self-reported smoking, blood pressure, lipid profiles, urinalysis, and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were collected from medical records retrospectively for investigating the relationship between the clinical parameters and the development of DN in T1DM. Results: During follow-up, 44 of the 224 patients (19.6%) developed DN, of whom 61.4% were female. Cox proportional hazards model analysis indicated that the female (HR 3.40, 95% CI 1.66-6.96, p = 0.001), smoking (HR 3.60, 95% CI 1.28-10.10, p = 0.015), HbA1c level (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.49, p = 0.005), diastolic blood pressure (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with DN after adjustment for multiple variables. The tight glucose control with multiple daily injections produced 49 % risk reduction (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.98, p = 0.043). Conclusions: The risk of DN in patients with juvenile-onset T1DM 10 years after the T1DM diagnosis was increased with female, smoking, high HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure levels and attenuated by intensive therapy.", "Keywords": ["adolescents", "children", "diabetic nephropathy", "risk factors", "type 1 diabetes mellitus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ching-Chien", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Hung", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Chun", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Fu-Sung", "Last Name": "Lo", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Chang Gung Juvenile Diabetes Eye Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30111889", "Title": "Nomogram for prediction of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes: a cohort study in an Asian population.", "Abstract": "The need for screening for retinopathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been emphasised, but diagnostic delays were reported when screening was done at fixed intervals. To establish an individualised risk-prediction model to assist screening non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in T1DM, we performed a retrospective cohort study enrolling participants in the Chang Gung Juvenile Diabetes Eye Study. There were 413 patients with 12 381 records analysed from 2005 to 2015. A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the risks of NPDR development and a nomogram with risk-stratification indicators was established based on the results. During 97 months of follow-up, 43 of 413 patients (10.4%) developed NPDR. Male sex (HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.19-0.85), age 5-14 years at onset of T1DM (6.38, 2.41-16.87), duration of diabetes (1.57, 1.41-1.75), and hemoglobin A1c level (1.56, 1.35-1.80) were independently associated with NPDR. Using the nomogram offers a quick method in the clinical setting to interpret the risk of NPDR development. Based on its weighting, each of the independent factors is allocated a score, and the total points indicate the probabilities of NPDR occurring within 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years.", "Keywords": [],

Severe inflammation of the anterior and posterior segments is frequently accompanied by corneal opacity, scleral abscess, and perforation or rupture. Enucleation or evisceration was the only remaining viable treatment option when all options to salvage the eye had been exhausted. The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the outcomes of patients with endogenous bacterial panophthalmitis, no light perception and scleral abscess who were treated with multiple intravitreal and periocular injections of antibiotics and dexamethasone. Evaluation included spreading of infection to contiguous or remote sites, following evisceration or enucleation, and sympathetic ophthalmia. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with EBP, with liver abscesses in eight patients, retroperitoneal infection in four, pneumonia in two, infective endocarditis in one, cellulitis in one, drug abuse in one, and mycotic pseudoaneurysm in one. Culture results were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in 12 patients, Streptococcus spp. in three, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, Escherichia coli in one, and Staphylococcus aureus in one. The average number of periocular injections was 2.2, and the average number of intravitreal injections was 5.8. No eye required evisceration or enucleation and developed the spreading of infection to contiguous or remote sites during the follow-up. No sympathetic ophthalmia was observed in the fellow eye of all patients. Prevention of evisceration or enucleation in patients with EBP, NLP and scleral abscess can be achieved by multiple intravitreal and periocular injections of antibiotics and dexamethasone.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Abscess", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Dexamethasone", "Escherichia coli", "Eye Evisceration", "Eye Infections, Bacterial", "Female", "Humans", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Panophthalmitis", "Retrospective Studies", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Streptococcus anginosus", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kuan-Jen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Yen-Po", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "An-Ning", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Chi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Chun", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Tun-Lu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tayouan, Taiwan."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27977832", "Title": "Nonresponse and Recurrence of Retinopathy of Prematurity After Intravitreal Ranibizumab Treatment.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the surgical outcome of type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) after intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) (Lucentis;

Although microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, the fundamental role of these cells in this disease is unknown. In the current study, sequential analyses suggest that microglia are recruited and appear after outer nuclear layer folding. By crossing rd7 mice (a model for hereditary retinal degeneration owing to Nr2e3 mutation) with mice carrying the macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (Mafia) transgene, we generated double-mutant mice and studied the role of the resident retinal microglia. Microglial cells in these double-mutant mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a suicide gene that can trigger Fas-mediated apoptosis via systemic treatment with AP20187 (FK506 dimerizer). We demonstrated that more than 80% of the EGFP+ cells in retinas from rd7/rd7;Tg/Tg mice express Iba-1 (a microglial marker), and resident microglia are still present in the retina because AP20187 does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Hence, only circulating bone marrow (BM)-derived microglia are depleted. Depletion of circulating BM-derived microglia accelerates retinal degeneration in rd7 mice. An increased number of autofluorescent (AF) spots is a consequence of resident microglia proliferation, which in turn establishes an inflammatory cytokine milieu via the upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 expression. This inflammation is likely to accelerate retinal degeneration. This study not only identifies inflammation as a crucial step in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration, but also highlights the involvement of specific cytokine genes that could serve as future treatment targets in retinal degenerations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Count", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Retinal Degeneration", "Rod Cell Outer Segment", "Tacrolimus", "Time Factors", "Vision Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Chun", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chi-Hsiu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lung-Kun", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chai Lin", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Nagasaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chung-Liang", "Last Name": "Chien", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23688710", "Title": "Outcomes of outpatient fluid-gas exchange for open macular hole after vitrectomy.", "Abstract": "To report the efficacy and safety of outpatient fluid-gas exchange for open macular hole after primary vitrectomy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Endotamponade", "Female", "Fluorocarbons", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatients", "Postoperative Complications", "Recurrence", "Retinal Perforations", "Retrospective Studies", "Sulfur Hexafluoride", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Failure", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Vitrectomy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yen-Po", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yih-Shiou", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lan-Hsin", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "I-Chia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kuan-Jen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei-Chi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chi-Chun", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of ophthalmology", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23644237", "Title": "Retinopathy of prematurity in neonatal patients with birth weight greater than 1500 g in Taiwan.", "Abstract": "To understand the characteristics, ophthalmic outcomes, and risk factors of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in patients with birth weight (BW) greater than 1500 g.
