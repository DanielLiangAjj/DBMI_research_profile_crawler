Herein, uniformly dispersed and favorable biosafety profile graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots immobilized with Fe-N4 moieties modulated by axial O atom (denoted as O-Fe-N4) are developed for converting H2O2 into 1O2 via Russell reaction, without introducing external energy.

The O-Fe-N4 catalyst demonstrates a specific activity of 79.58 U mg-1 at pH 6.2, outperforming the most reported Fe-N4 catalysts. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the axial O atom can effectively modulate the relative position and electron affinity between Fe and N, lowering the activation energy, strengthening the selectivity, and thus facilitating the Russell-type reaction. The gratifying enzymatic activity stemming from the well-defined Fe-N/O structure can inhibit tumor proliferation by efficiently downregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 activity and inducing lipid peroxidation.

NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) is a promising therapeutic target for MAFLD. Diosgenin (DG) is a natural compound that was identified in a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, which has pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and hypolipidemic activities. In this study, we examined the effects and molecular mechanisms of DG on MAFLD in vitro and in vivo. We established a rat model by administering a high-fat diet (HFD). We also generated an in vitro MAFLD model by treating HepG2 cells with free fatty acids (FFAs). The results indicated that DG attenuated lipid accumulation and liver injury in both in vitro and in vivo models. DG downregulated the expression of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speckle-like protein (ASC), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), GSDMD-n, and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2).

Presence of such defects could lead to premature failure of the structure. In principle, structural integrity assessment of LPBF metals can be accomplished with nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Pulsed infrared thermography (PIT) is a non-contact, one-sided NDE method that allows for imaging of internal defects in arbitrary size and shape metallic structures using heat transfer. PIT imaging is performed using compact instrumentation consisting of a flash lamp for deposition of a heat pulse, and a fast frame infrared (IR) camera for measuring surface temperature transients. However, limitations of imaging resolution with PIT include blurring due to heat diffusion, sensitivity limit of the IR camera. We demonstrate enhancement of PIT imaging capability with unsupervised learning (UL), which enables PIT microscopy of subsurface defects in high strength corrosion resistant stainless steel 316 alloy. PIT images were processed with UL spatial-temporal separation-based clustering segmentation (STSCS) algorithm, refined by morphology image processing methods to enhance visibility of defects. The STSCS algorithm starts with wavelet decomposition to spatially de-noise thermograms, followed by UL principal component analysis (PCA), fine-tuning optimization, and neural learning-based independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms to temporally compress de-noised thermograms. The compressed thermograms were further processed with UL-based graph thresholding K-means clustering algorithm for defects segmentation.

Here, we describe a solution deposition method in the presence of anionic additives, which yields shape-controlled, single-crystal plasmonic gold nanostructures on Ag(100) and Au(100) substrates. Use of SO42- ions yields smooth Au(111)-faceted square pyramids with large plasmonic Raman enhancements. Halide additives produce textured hillocks comprising edge- and screw-type dislocations (Cl-), or platelets with large-area Au(100) terraces and (110) step edges (Br-), while SO42- and Br- additive combinations provide Au(110)-faceted square pyramids. With lithographic patterning, this chemistry yields metal deposition with precise geometry and location control to provide single-crystal, plasmonic gold metasurfaces with tailored optical response. The appropriately designed metasurfaces can then generate large Raman scattering enhancements, far greater than high density gold square pyramids with random surface disposition.

In this study, we tested and analyzed the structural parameters and filtration performances of the four most commonly used new filter materials in the current market. The results showed that all four new filter materials showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing their filtration efficiency with an increase in filtration velocity. The filtration efficiency of the materials was as follows: PTFE > glass fiber > nanomaterial > electret. The filtration efficiency of all materials reached its maximum when the filtration velocity was 0.2 m/s. The filtration efficiency of the PTFE for PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 was higher than that of the other three materials, with values of 0.87% to 24.93%, 1.21% to 18.69%, and 0.56% to 16.03%, respectively. PTFE was more effective in capturing particles smaller than 1.0 \u03bcm. Within the testing velocity range, the resistance of the filter materials was as follows: glass fiber > PTFE > electret > nanomaterial, and the resistance of the four materials showed a good fitting effect. It is also necessary to match the resistance with the filtration efficiency during use, as well as to study the effectiveness of filter materials in blocking microorganisms and absorbing toxic gases.

DNA methylation can regulate the TME without altering the DNA sequence. However, research on the methylation-driven TME in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still lacking. In this study, integrated DNA methylation and RNA-seq data were used to explore methylation-driven genes (MDGs). Immune scores were calculated using the ESTIMATE, which was employed to identify TME-related genes. A new signature connected with methylation-regulated TME using univariate, multivariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analyses was developed. This signature consists of four TME-MDGs, including AJAP1, HOXB9, MYH14, and SLC6A19, which exhibit high methylation and low expression in tumors. Validation was performed using qRT-PCR which confirmed their downregulation in ccRCC clinical samples. Additionally, the signature demonstrated stable predictive performance in different subtypes of ccRCC. Risk scores are positively correlated with TMN stages, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and adverse outcomes of immunotherapy. Interestingly, the expression of four TME-MDGs are highly correlated with the sensitivity of first-line drugs in ccRCC treatment, especially pazopanib. Molecular docking indicates a high affinity binding between the proteins and pazopanib. In summary, our study elucidates the comprehensive role of methylation-driven TME in ccRCC, aiding in identifying patients sensitive to immunotherapy and targeted therapy, and providing new therapeutic targets for ccRCC treatment.", "Keywords": ["DNA methylation", "clear-cell renal cell carcinoma", "molecular docking", "prognostic signature", "tumor microenvironment"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Humans", "Tumor Microenvironment", "DNA Methylation", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Pyrimidines", "Indazoles", "Sulfonamides", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Female", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zijian", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Jialiang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Yifan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Deyana", "Last Name": "Ivanova", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Hypertension, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weiyu", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianning", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Fangfang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Reproduction, Development of the Ministry of Education of China, School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuemei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Reproduction, Development of the Ministry of Education of China, School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingxiong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Reproduction, Development of the Ministry of Education of China, School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Meijiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jun20"}, {"PMID": "38928068", "Title": "The Formation of D-Allulose 3-Epimerase Hybrid Nanoflowers and Co-Immobilization on Resins for Improved Enzyme Activity, Stability, and Processability.", "Abstract": "As a low-calorie sugar, D-allulose is produced from D-fructose catalyzed by D-allulose 3-epimerase (DAE).

Subsequently, it was applied as a potent peroxydisulfate (PDS) activator to remove tetracycline (TC) from water. The results showed that the WW FA-800 exhibited remarkable adsorption performance as well as highly efficient catalytic activation of PDS, with a 115\u00a0mg/g maximum TC adsorption capacity and 93.5% (reaction kinetic rate\u00a0=\u00a0315 \u03bcmol/g/h) TC removal within 60\u00a0min.

Although various predictors based on molecular features and graphs have been published to boost the identification of NPIs, most of them often ignore the information between known NPIs or exhibit insufficient learning ability from graphs, posing a significant challenge in effectively identifying NPIs. To develop a more reliable and accurate predictor for NPIs, in this article, we propose NPI-DCGNN, an end-to-end NPI predictor based on a dual-channel graph neural network (DCGNN). NPI-DCGNN initially treats the known NPIs as an ncRNA-protein bipartite graph. Subsequently, for each ncRNA-protein pair, NPI-DCGNN extracts two local subgraphs centered around the ncRNA and protein, respectively, from the bipartite graph. After that, it utilizes a dual-channel graph representation learning layer based on GNN to generate high-level feature representations for the ncRNA-protein pair. Finally, it employs a fully connected network and output layer to predict whether an interaction exists between the pair of ncRNA and protein. Experimental results on four experimentally validated datasets demonstrate that NPI-DCGNN outperforms several state-of-the-art NPI predictors. Our case studies on the NPInter database further demonstrate the prediction power of NPI-DCGNN in predicting NPIs. With the availability of the source codes (https://github.com/zhangxin11111/NPI-DCGNN), we anticipate that NPI-DCGNN could facilitate the studies of ncRNA interactome by providing highly reliable NPI candidates for further experimental validation.", "Keywords": ["dual-channel", "graph neural network", "ncRNA-protein interactions", "noncoding RNA"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Information Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Liangwei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "College of Information Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziyi", "Last Name": "Chai", "Affiliation": "College of Information Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Software, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Quanzhong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Information Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun26"}, {"PMID": "38921488", "Title": "Anion Exchange Membrane with Pendulous Piperidinium on Twisted All-Carbon Backbone for Fuel Cell.", "Abstract": "As a central component for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), the anion exchange membrane is now facing the challenge of further improving its conductivity and alkali stability.

In this work, we investigated the VOCs emission characteristics and concentrations of individual contaminants generated by the packaging and printing industries, with regard to various categories, processes, and geographic regions. VOCs emissions, ozone formation potential (OFP), and associated health risks were assessed at 10 representative packaging and printing firms across several cities in Shandong Province, China. Plastic packaging enterprises had the greatest levels of unorganized VOCs emissions, consisting predominantly of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), followed by alkanes and halocarbons. From metal and paper packaging enterprises, OVOCs, alkanes, and aromatics were significant components of unorganized VOCs emissions. Aromatics, halocarbons, and OVOCs contributed significantly to OFP in workshops. The potential carcinogenic risk associated with VOCs in the packaging and printing industries was not significant.

Silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) were synthesized by chemical reduction method using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as reducing agent, and were coupled with CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) to form the ratiometric fluorescence nanoprobe silver nanoclusters-quantum dots (AgNCs-QDs). The effect of the volume ratio of CdSe/ZnS QDs to AgNCs on the fluorescence ratio of AgNCs-QDs was investigated. The fluorescence characterization results show that two emission peaks of AgNCs-QDs are located at 473\u00a0nm and 661\u00a0nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that H2O2 can cause the fluorescence probe to aggregate, while etching AgNCs to produce silver ions, which together cause the fluorescence of the QDs in the ratiometric fluorescent probe to be quenched. Based on this strategy, the fluorescence intensity ratio of the two emission peaks F473/F661 exhibits a strong linear correlation with the concentration of H2O2. The detection range is 3.32 \u00b5M\u2009~\u20092.65 mM with a detection limit of 3.32 \u00b5M.

In this study, fresh smoke emissions from the combustion of three types of agricultural biomass residues (rice, maize, and wheat straws) were photochemically aged in an oxidation flow reactor. The changes in BBOA composition were characterized by offline analysis using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The BBOA molecular composition varied dramatically with biomass type and aging process. Fresh and aged BBOA were predominated by CHO and nitrogen-containing CHON, CHN, and CHONS species, while with very few CHOS and other non\u2011oxygen species. The signal peak area variations revealed that individual molecular species underwent dynamic changes, with 77-81\u00a0% of fresh species decreased or even disappeared and 33-46\u00a0% of aged species being newly formed. A notable increase was observed in the number and peak area of CxHyO\u22656 compounds in aged BBOA, suggesting that photochemical process served as an important source of highly oxygenated species. Heterocyclic CxHyN2 compounds mostly dominated in fresh CHN species, whereas CxHyN1 were more abundant in aged ones.

Using large-scale network analysis of electroencephalography (EEG), the current study intended to investigate if there are differences in functional connectivity properties extracted during visual WM coding stages between MCI patients and normal controls (NC). A total of 21 MCI patients and 20 NC performed visual memory tasks of load four, while 32-channel EEG recordings were acquired. The functional connectivity properties were extracted from the acquired EEGs by the directed transform function (DTF) via spectral Granger causal analysis. Brain network analyses revealed distinctive brain network patterns between the two groups during the WM coding stage. Compared with the NC, MCI patients exhibited a reduced visual network connectivity of the frontal-temporal in \u03b8 (4-7Hz) band. A likely compensation mechanism was observed in MCI patients, with a strong brain functional connectivity of the frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital in both \u03b8 and \u03b1 (8-13Hz) band. Further analyses of the network core node properties based on the differential brain network showed that, in \u03b8 band, there was a significant difference in the out-degree of the frontal lobe and parietal lobe between the two groups, while in \u03b1 band, such difference was located only in the parietal lobe. The current study found that, in MCI patients, dysconnectivity is found from the prefrontal lobe to bilateral temporal lobes, leading to increased recruitment of functional connectivity in the frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital direction. The dysconnectivity pattern of MCI is more complex and primarily driven by core nodes Pz and Fz.

Sustainable methods for aromatic production from alternative sources, particularly the methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) process using zeolite ZSM-5 and associated with the \"methanol economy\", have garnered widespread attention. To facilitate this transition, our project consolidates conventional strategies that impact aromatics selectivity-such as using hierarchical zeolites, metallic promoters, or altering zeolite physicochemical properties-into a unified study. Our findings demonstrate the beneficial impact of elongated crystal size and heightened zeolite hierarchy on preferential aromatics selectivity, albeit through distinct mechanisms involving the consumption of shorter olefins. While metallic promoters enhance MTA performance, crystal size, and hierarchy remain pivotal in achieving the maximized aromatics selectivity. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of achieving superior aromatics selectivity through physicochemical modifications in zeolite ZSM-5 during MTA catalysis, thereby advancing the field's comprehension of structure-reactivity relationships.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430072, PR China. abhishek@whu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Tuiana", "Last Name": "Shoinkhorova", "Affiliation": "KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia. javier.ruizmartinez@kaust.edu.sa."}, {"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430072, PR China. abhishek@whu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430072, PR China. abhishek@whu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430072, PR China. abhishek@whu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Sang-Ho", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia. javier.ruizmartinez@kaust.edu.sa."}, {"First Name": "Javier", "Last Name": "Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia. javier.ruizmartinez@kaust.edu.sa."}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Gascon", "Affiliation": "KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia. javier.ruizmartinez@kaust.edu.sa."}, {"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Dutta Chowdhury", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430072, PR China. abhishek@whu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "PubDate": "2024Jun20"}, {"PMID": "38899155", "Title": "Effects of elicitors from culture filtrate of Fusarium solani CL105 on flavonoid production of Scutellaria baicalensis calli.", "Abstract": "Endophytic fungi can promote secondary metabolite accumulation in medicinal plants.

As there is a paucity of KAP data in China, this cross-sectional survey therefore sought to assess KAP related to HZ from the general population, patients with HZ, and dermatologists in China. The total number of respondents from the general population, HZ patients, and dermatologists were 804, 282, and 160, respectively. Notably, some gaps in knowledge regarding the severity, transmission, and prevention of HZ were identified across all groups. For example, less than half of respondents from the general population and HZ patients understood that vaccination does not treat HZ. For dermatologists, not all were aware of adverse reactions following HZ vaccination and some had misconceptions regarding the mode of transmission of HZ. Given the link between an individual's disease knowledge to their attitudes and practices, improved understanding of HZ could underlie positive attitudes and help reinforce healthcare professionals' recommendations in the management and prevention of HZ. In particular, doctors may be well-positioned to support HZ prevention initiatives, as most of the general population and HZ patients found vaccination more acceptable if recommended by a doctor (78.9% and 81.6%, respectively).

Dietary modulation targeting the gut microbiota is an effective prescription for improving exercise performance and alleviating exercise fatigue. This article discusses the connection between exercise and the makeup of the gut microbiota, as well as the detrimental effects of excessive exercise on gut health. Herein, we elaborate on the possible mechanism of the gut microbiota in improving exercise performance, which involves enhancing skeletal muscle function, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the neuroendocrine system. The effects of dietary nutrition strategies and probiotic supplementation on exercise from the perspective of the gut microbiota are also discussed in this paper.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects exerted by seven natural products (curcumin, silymarin, resveratrol, artichoke leaf extract, berberine, catechins, and naringenin) on patients with NAFLD. For this purpose, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exclusively. The selected studies were evaluated for methodological quality via the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, and data analysis software was used to analyze the data accordingly. The RCTs from the earliest available date until September 2022 were collected. This process resulted in 37 RCTs with a total sample size of 2509 patients being included. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that artichoke leaf extract confers a relative advantage in reducing the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (SUCRA: 99.1%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (SUCRA: 88.2%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (SUCRA: 88.9%). Naringenin conferred an advantage in reducing triglyceride (TG) levels (SUCRA: 97.3%), total cholesterol (TC) levels (SUCRA: 73.9%), and improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (SUCRA: 74.9%). High-density catechins significantly reduced body mass index (BMI) levels (SUCRA: 98.5%) compared with the placebo. The Ranking Plot of the Network indicated that artichoke leaf extract and naringenin performed better than the other natural products in facilitating patient recovery. Therefore, we propose that artichoke leaf extract and naringenin may exert a better therapeutic effect on NAFLD.

Next, we employed the ssGSEA method to assess regulons in two bulk RNA datasets. Significant statistical differences were observed in 9 and 13 regulons in each dataset. By intersecting these differentiated regulons and identifying shared targets that appeared at least twice, we successfully pinpointed three differentially expressed targets across both datasets. In this study, we assessed and identified 19 gene regulatory networks that were responsive to the disease. Furthermore, we validated these networks using two bulk RNA datasets of DCM.

The remaining five groups represent untapped genetic sources, providing access to landrace-specific alleles and haplotypes for breeding. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) based haplotypes and association genetics analyses link Watkins genomes to the thousands of high-resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL), and significant marker-trait associations identified.

This disease can not only lead to a change in facial expression but also greatly impact the psychology of patients. In severe cases, it can affect the normal work and life of patients. Therefore, the research on facial nerve injury repair has important clinical significance. In order to study the mechanism of this disease, it is necessary to carry out relevant animal experiments, among which the most important task is to establish an animal model with the same pathogenesis as human disease. The compression of the facial nerve within the petrous bone, especially the nerve trunk at the junction of the distal end of the internal auditory canal and the labyrinthine segment, is the pathogenesis of idiopathic facial paralysis. In order to simulate this common disease, a compression injury model of the main extracranial segment of the facial nerve was established in this study. The neurological damage was evaluated by behavioral, neuroelectrophysiological, and histological examination. Finally, 50 g constant force and 90 s clamp injury were selected as the injury parameters to construct a stable idiopathic facial paralysis model.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Rats", "Facial Nerve Injuries", "Facial Paralysis", "Bell Palsy", "Facial Nerve", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xie", "Last Name": "Yandong", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; The Cranial Nerve Disease Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Tingting", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; The Cranial Nerve Disease Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University."}, {"First Name": "Liu", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Nanjing Brain Hospital, Nanjing Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Liu", "Last Name": "Mingxi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Nanjing Brain Hospital, Nanjing Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Wang", "Last Name": "Ran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Nanjing Brain Hospital, Nanjing Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Shiting", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; The Cranial Nerve Disease Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; The Cranial Nerve Disease Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University; zhangxin6010@126.com."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2024May31"}, {"PMID": "38883836", "Title": "Lung tumor discrimination by deep neural network model CanDo via DNA methylation in bronchial lavage.", "Abstract": "Bronchoscopic-assisted discrimination of lung tumors presents challenges, especially in cases with contraindications or inaccessible lesions.

The Recursive Feature Elimination Cross-Validation and deep neural network algorithm established the CanDo classification model, which incorporated 11 methylation features (including 8 specific to the TBR1 gene), demonstrating a sensitivity of 98.6% and specificity of 97.8%. In contrast, bronchoscopic rapid on-site evaluation (bronchoscopic-ROSE) had lower sensitivity (87.7%) and specificity (80%). Further validation in 33 individuals confirmed CanDo's discriminatory potential, particularly in challenging cases for bronchoscopic-ROSE due to pathological complexity.

Yet, the molecular mechanism of MLT protection is still unclear. Some studies have shown that melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) is very important for animal reproductive system. To evaluate whether MLT exerts its protective effect on cryopreserved mice ovarian tissue via MT1, we added antagonist of MT1/MT2 (Luzindor) or antagonist of MT2 (4P-PDOT) to the freezing solution, followed by cryopreservation and thawing of ovarian tissue. The levels of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected.

This study investigates the combined impact of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics (L: 1\u00a0mm, S: 100\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.1%, 1%) and Cd on soil properties, available Cd content, maize growth, and Cd accumulation by mazie through pot experiments. The findings unveiled notable impacts of the treatment groups, namely MP-L0.1%, MP-S0.1%, MP-L1%, and MP-S1%, on soil organic carbon (SOC), maize height, and catalase (CAT) activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The dosage of MPs significantly influenced maize height, MP-S0.1% treatment resulted in a 5.6% reduction, while the other groups had insignificant effects. Particle size and dosage significantly affected SOC and CAT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The MP-L1% and MP-S1% groups resulted in increases of SOC by 121.5% and 281.0%, respectively. CAT reductions were 32.6%, 62.8%, 41.9%, and 34.9% in MP-L0.1%, MP-S0.1%, MP-L1%, and MP-S1% groups, individually. The Cd treatment induced a significant decrease in soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), maize stem diameter, and root length, accompanied by significant increases in maize plant height, malondialdehyde (MDA), CAT, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Combined LDPE and Cd contamination had significant effects on maize height and Cd content in leaves. Specifically, MP-L0.1%+Cd, MP-S0.1%+Cd, MP-L1%+Cd, and MP-S1%+Cd reduced maize height by 4.1%, 4.5%, 8.7%, and 13.8%, respectively. The co-presence of LDPE and Cd increased available Cd content in soil while elevating Cd concentration in maize shoots and roots, with a notable 25.5% increase in Cd concentration in maize leaves in the MP-L1%+Cd group compared to the Cd group.

The biological effects and underlying mechanism of TRIM8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF1\u03b1) is a key transcriptional factor that plays a significant role in regulating hepatocyte differentiation and liver function. The reduced expression of HNF1\u03b1 is a critical event in the development of HCC, but the underlying mechanism for its degradation remains elusive. In this study, we discovered that the expression of TRIM8 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and was positively correlated with aggressive tumor behavior of HCC and shorter survival of HCC patients. Overexpression of TRIM8 promoted the proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells, while TRIM8 knockdown or knockout exerted the opposite effects. RNA sequencing revealed that TRIM8 knockout suppresses several cancer-related pathways, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in HepG2 cells. TRIM8 directly interacts with HNF1\u03b1, promoting its degradation by catalyzing polyubiquitination on lysine 197 in HCC cells. Moreover, the cancer-promoting effects of TRIM8 in HCC were abolished by the HNF1\u03b1-K197R mutant in vitro and in vivo.

Among the candidates, nanocrystal-molecule complexes have received tremendous attention for triplet generation because of easier spin flip and negligible energy loss during intersystem crossing. However, the triplet energy transfer (TET) from nanocrystals (NCs) to molecules can be very complicated in actual situation due to intricate energy level alignment and inevitable defect states, which often involves various decay pathes of the excited state competing with TET. Understanding the detailed carrier dynamics in such complexes is strongly necessary for related applications. Here, a CdSe-TCA (5-tetracene carboxylic acid) complex with a Type-II like energy level alignment is synthesized through precisely adjusting the dimension of CdSe NC. Based on series of spectral measurements, especially the transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, the results show various carrier dynamics including hole-transfer-mediated TET, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and carrier trapping. Although the carrier trapping by defect states in CdSe NC is revealed not associated with the TET from CdSe to TCA, the FRET is proved to competing with the TET process. Both the FRET and defect states should be refrained for efficient TET in such complexes.

In vivo subchondral bone repairing results demonstrate that the scaffold's meticulous design has the most suitable properties for subchondral bone repair. The porous structure of inorganic particles within the scaffold facilitates efficient transport of loaded exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles assembled in the microspheres could promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and accelerate the generation of new bone. These features enable the scaffold to exhibit favorable subchondral bone repair properties and attain high cartilage repair scores. The therapy results prove that the subchondral bone support considerably influences the upper cartilage repair process.

Herein, we constructed a kind of composite separator (ZIF-90@PP) consisting of zeolite imidazole framework-90 (ZIF-90) and polypropylene (PP) to promote the uniform deposition of Li+ and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. The aldehyde groups interacting with TFSI- and the nitrogen-containing negative groups attracting Li+ of ZIF-90 can facilitate the dissociation of LiTFSI to release more Li+, thus alleviating the influence of space charge near the electrode surface and accelerating the transfer of Li+. Not only does the excellent electrolyte wettability of ZIF-90 enhance the electrolyte retention capacity of the separator, but the orderly nano-channels in ZIF-90 also restrict the free migration of anions and homogenize the distribution of Li+. Consequently, the functional separator achieves a long-term stable Li plating/stripping cycling for over 780 h at 2 mA cm-2. Moreover, an impressive average coulombic efficiency of 98.67% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles is realized by Li || LFP full cells based on ZIF-90@PP with a capacity retention rate of 71.22%.

Therefore, the lack of currently approved drugs for anti-NAFLD has gradually gained attention. SIRT1, as a member of the sirtuins family, is now the most widely studied in the pathophysiology of many metabolic diseases, and has great potential for preventing and treating NAFLD. Natural products such as Diosgenin (DG) have the potential to be developed as clinical drugs for the treatment of NAFLD due to their excellent multi-target therapeutic effects. In this study, we found that DG can activate the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway and upregulate the expression of its downstream targets nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), complex IV (COX IV), mitofusin-2 (MFN2), and PPAR\u03b1 (perox-isome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1) in SD rats induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and HepG2 cells caused by free fatty acids (FFAs, sodium oleate: sodium palmitate\u00a0=\u00a02:1). Conversely, the levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and inflammatory factors, including NF-\u03baB p65, IL6, and TNF\u03b1, were downregulated both in vitro and in vivo. This improved mitochondrial dysfunction, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), lipid accumulation, steatosis, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte inflammation. Subsequently, we applied SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and SIRT1 agonist SRT1720 to confirm further the necessity of activating SIRT1 for DG to exert therapeutic effects on NAFLD. In summary, these results further demonstrate the potential therapeutic role of DG as a SIRT1 natural agonist for NAFLD.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recurrent metastasis, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). There is an annual increase in the proportion of AFPGC cases, rising from 3.45% in 2017 to 7.88% in 2023. Higher serum AFP level was associated with increased likelihood of lymph node metastasis (P=0.006), deeper invasion depth (P=0.000) and greater tumor diameter (P=0.036). Independent predictors of recurrent metastasis included T4 infiltration, lymph node metastasis, tumor diameter >5 cm, poorly differentiated-undifferentiated pathology, preoperative AFP>1000 ng/mL, and postoperative increasing trend in AFP levels. The 5-year OS and DFS rates were 36.5% and 34.2%, respectively, with poorer survival linked to higher preoperative AFP levels and postoperative increasing trend in AFP level. Independent risk factors for poor OS and DFS included T4 infiltration, lymph node metastasis, poorly differentiated-undifferentiated pathology, preoperative AFP>1000 ng/mL, and postoperative increasing trend in AFP. Serum AFP level can serve as a potential predictive and prognostic biomarker. Identifying independent risk factors informs risk stratification and personalized treatment for AFPGC patients.", "Keywords": ["Alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer", "prognostic factors", "radical surgery", "recurrent metastasis patterns", "serum alpha-fetoprotein levels"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fengbin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinran", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingnan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Tongkun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Honghai", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping'an", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Peigang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaolong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenjiang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Qun", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Comprehensive Treatment of Gastric Cancer Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruixing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China."}], "Journal": "American journal of cancer research", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38859395", "Title": "4.3\u2005\u00b5m high-power amplified spontaneous emission fiber source based on CO2-filled nested hollow-core anti-resonant fiber.", "Abstract": "We report a 4.3\u2005\u00b5m mid-infrared (mid-IR) high-power amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) fiber source based on CO2-filled nested hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (Nested HC-ARF).

Recent studies utilize a feature extractor shared on the source and target domains to capture the domain-invariant features and the task-relevant information with both feature-alignment constraint and source annotations. However, the feature extractor shared across domains discards partial task-relevant information of the target domain due to the domain gap and lack of target annotations, leading to compromised discrimination capabilities within target domain. To this end, we propose a novel REmainder Adaptive CompensaTion network (REACT) to adaptively compensate the extracted features with the remainder features for generating task-relevant features. The key insight is that the remainder features contain the discarded task-relevant information, so they can be adapted to compensate for the inadequate target features. Especially, REACT introduces an additional remainder branch to regain the remainder features, and then adaptively utilizes them to compensate for the discarded task-relevant information, improving discrimination on the target domain.

Consequently, scientists have started to shift their attention from stem cells to extracellular vesicles due to their similar structures and properties.

The impacts of antibiotics on bio-denitrification and the metabolic response of denitrifiers to antibiotics are unclear. We systematically analyzed the effect of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on bio-denitrification and found that 5 mg/L CIP greatly inhibited denitrification with a model denitrifier (Paracoccus denitrificans). Nitrate reduction decreased by 32.89 % and nitrous oxide emission increased by 75.53 %. The balance analysis of carbon and nitrogen metabolism during denitrification showed that CIP exposure blocked electron transfer and reduced the flow of substrate metabolism used for denitrification. Proteomics results showed that CIP exposure induced denitrifiers to use the pentose phosphate pathway more for substrate metabolism. This caused a substrate preference to generate NADPH to prevent cellular damage rather than NADH for denitrification. Notably, despite denitrifiers having antioxidant defenses, they could not completely prevent oxidative damage caused by CIP exposure. The effect of CIP exposure on denitrifiers after removal of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) demonstrated that EPS around denitrifiers formed a barrier against CIP. Fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy revealed that the binding effect of proteins in EPS to CIP prevented damage.

The yellow-leaved albino individual NH1 exhibited abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure and reduced chlorophyll/carotenoid levels compared to green-leaved NL1.

In yeast, histone CsH1.2 binds to the CsNYC1a promoter. These findings suggest that CsH1.2-CsNYC1a-mediated chlorophyll degradation may be a key mechanism underlying albino formation in Nanchuan Dachashu.

Furthermore, the CFPPS exhibited small or no associations with pre-treatment sleep problems, depression symptoms, or anxiety symptoms but was a significant predictor of working alliance and psychological benefit in therapy. The capacity for the psychotherapy process among younger adolescents was lower than that among older adolescents.

In this region, limited heat conditions strongly arrest cotton plant growth and development resulting in recued productivity. To counteract this problem, there is an urgent need to robustly identify efficient management strategies to improve plant performance and increase cotton yield under heat-limited situations. This will hold crucial implications for agricultural sustainability and global cotton supply. This review article identified challenges faced by cotton producers under heat limited environments with potential solutions to enhance cotton productivity. Specifically, we focused on the implementation of two life history strategies including planting early maturing and cold tolerant cultivars, and adjusting sowing date that can promote early maturity and increase cold stress tolerance. These strategies have shown promising results in protecting cotton plants from limited heat injury and consequently improved cotton productivity. By focusing on Xinjiang province unique climate and associated agronomic practices, valuable insights can be gained, which may have broader applications in other heat-limited cotton-growing regions globally.

This study investigated whether CTCs could be used as a potential prognosis predictor in patients with gastric cancer. A total of 120 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were enrolled from January 1, 2015, to December 1, 2019. All patients were initially diagnosed without previous treatment, and then the number of CTCs was detected using the NEimFISH method before radical surgical resection. Regular follow-up was performed in all patients, and the correlations between the number of CTCs and clinical endpoints, such as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), were evaluated. The univariate and multivariate hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model.

In addition, the median follow-up of all the patients was 38.0\u00a0months (range of 28-80\u00a0months); the DFS in CTC-positive patients was significantly shorter than that of the CTC-negative patients, and a significant difference was found based on the Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis (44.52\u2009\u00b1\u20092.83\u00a0m vs. 74.99\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78\u00a0m, HR\u2009=\u20094.550, P\u2009=\u20090.018).

In this study, we present the functional characterization of a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor F. pseudograminearum, designated Fp487. In F. pseudograminearum, Fp487 is shown to be required for mycelial growth through gene knockout and phenotypic analyses. Compared with wild-type CF14047, the \u2206Fp487 mutant displayed a slight reduction in growth rate but a significant decrease in conidiogenesis, pathogenicity and 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3AcDON) production. Moreover, the mutant exhibited heightened sensitivity to oxidative and cytomembrane stress. Furthermore, we synthesized dsRNA from the Fp487 gene in vitro, resulting in a reduction in the growth rate of F. pseudograminearum and its virulence on barley leaves through spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS). Notably, this study makes the first instance of inducing the expression of abundant dsRNA from F. pseudograminearum by engineering the Escherichia coli strain HT115 (DE3) and utilizing the SIGS technique to evaluate the virulence effect of dsRNA on F. pseudograminearum. In conclusion, our findings revealed the crucial role of Fp487 in regulating pathogenicity, stress responses, DON production, and conidiogenesis in F. pseudograminearum. Furthermore, Fp487 is a potential RNAi-based target for FCR control.", "Keywords": ["FCR", "Fusarium pseudograminearum", "Spray-induced gene silencing", "Virulence", "Wheat", "Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Fusarium", "Plant Diseases", "Virulence", "Fungal Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Hordeum", "Spores, Fungal", "Triticum", "Plant Leaves", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "China", "Mycelium", "Gene Silencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoyue", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China; Key Laboratory of Sustainable Crop Production in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (Co-construction by Ministry and Province), College of Agriculture, Yangtze University,\u00a0Jingzhou,\u00a0Hubei 434025,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Shulin", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China; Jiangsu Co-Innovation Centre for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University,\u00a0Yangzhou,\u00a0Jiangsu 225009,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Haiyan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyu", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sustainable Crop Production in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (Co-construction by Ministry and Province), College of Agriculture, Yangtze University,\u00a0Jingzhou,\u00a0Hubei 434025,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Dongfang", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sustainable Crop Production in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (Co-construction by Ministry and Province), College of Agriculture, Yangtze University,\u00a0Jingzhou,\u00a0Hubei 434025,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Huaigu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\u00a0Nanjing,\u00a0Jiangsu 210014,\u00a0China; Jiangsu Co-Innovation Centre for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University,\u00a0Yangzhou,\u00a0Jiangsu 225009,\u00a0China.

"NIR-II Absorption/Emission Dual Function Based 2D Targeted Nanotheranostics for Tunable Hydrogenothermal Therapy.", "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising approach for treating tumors that offers multiple advantages. Nevertheless, its practical use in clinical settings faces several limitations, such as suboptimal delivery efficiency, uneven heat distribution, and challenges in predicting optimal treatment duration. In addition, the localized hyperthermia generated by the PTT method to induce cell apoptosis can result in the production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of inflammatory cytokines, which can pose a threat to the healthy tissues surrounding the tumor. To address the above challenges, this work designs an integrated H2 delivery nanoplatform for multimodal imaging H2 thermal therapy. The combination of the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging (FL) agent (CQ4T) and the photothermal and photoacoustic (PA) properties of Ti3C2 (TC) enables real-time monitoring of the tumor area and guides photothermal treatment. Simultaneously, due to the acid-responsive H2 release characteristics of the nanoplatform, H2 can be utilized for synergistic photothermal therapy to eradicate tumor cells effectively. Significantly, acting as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, Ti3C2-BSA-CQ4T-H2 (TCBCH) protects peritumoral normal cells from damage. The proposed technique utilizing H2 gas for combination therapies and multimodal imaging integration exhibits prospects for effective and secure treatment of tumors in future clinical applications.", "Keywords": ["NIR\u2010II fluorescence imaging", "inflammatory chemicals", "photoacoustic imaging", "photothermal therapy", "reactive oxygen species"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinxuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Mengting", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenxuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Shichao", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Chongqing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital/Shanxi Hospital Affiliated to Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shanxi Medical University, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengmin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaodong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Low Dimensional Materials Physics and Preparing Technology, School of Sciences, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziliang", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Fifth Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital), Taiyuan, 030032, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruiping", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Fifth Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital), Taiyuan, 030032, China."}], "Journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "PubDate": "2024May30"}, {"PMID": "38814207", "Title": "Metabonomics analysis of aqueous humor samples from cataract patients with branch retinal vein occlusion.", "Abstract": "Cataract (CAT) has a very high incidence rate among the middle-aged and elderly, with most patients complicated by branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), a key cause of blindness.

How to accurately recognize and efficiently separate target rare earth ions with similar radii and chemical properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, precise two-dimensional (2D) heterogeneous channels are constructed using engineered E. coli membranes between graphene oxide (GO) layers. The difference in binding ability and corresponding conformational change between Lanmodulin (LanM) and rare earth ions in the heterogeneous channel allows for precisely recognizing and sieving of scandium ions (Sc3+). The engineered E. coli membranes not only can protect the integrity of structure and functionality of LanM, the rich lipids and sugars, but also help the Escherichia coli (E. coli) membranes closely tile on the GO nanosheets through interaction, preventing swelling and controlling interlayer spacing accurately down to the sub-nanometer. Apparently, the 2D heterogeneous channels showcase excellent selectivity for trivalent ions (SFFe /Sc\u22483), especially for Sc3+ ions in REE with high selectivity (SFCe/Sc\u2248167, SFLa/Sc\u2248103).

The infiltrative nature of gliomas makes rapid diagnosis necessary to guide the extent of surgical resection of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The combination of tissue biopsy and MS analysis used here satisfies this requirement. The key feature of both described methods is the use of tandem MS to measure the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) relative to endogenous glutamate (Glu) to characterize the presence of mutant tumor. The experiments i) provide IDH mutation status for individual patients and ii) demonstrate a strong correlation of 2HG signals with tumor infiltration. The measured ratio of 2HG to Glu correlates with IDH-mutant (IDH-mut) glioma (P < 0.0001) in the tumor core data of both teams. Despite using different ionization methods and different mass spectrometers, comparable performance in determining IDH mutations from core tumor biopsies was achieved with sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies all at 100%. None of the 31 patients at Mayo Clinic or the 74 patients at Huashan Hospital were misclassified when analyzing tumor core biopsies. Robustness of the methodology was evaluated by postoperative re-examination of samples. Both teams noted the presence of high concentrations of 2HG at surgical margins, supporting future use of intraoperative MS to monitor for clean surgical margins.

Mirikizumab efficacy in patients with UC showed an apparent positive association with systemic exposure following both induction and maintenance.

Herein, we recruited 40,486 preschool children from randomly selected daycare centers in 7 cities in China from 2019 to 2020, and estimated exposure to residential greenness by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a 500\u00a0m buffer. Exposure to ambient PM (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) was evaluated using a satellite-based prediction model (daily, at a resolution of 1\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km). By mixed-effect logistic regression, NDVI values during pregnancy, in the first (0-1\u00a0year old) and the second (1-2\u00a0years old) year of life were negatively associated with lifetime rhinitis (LR) and current rhinitis (CR) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). PM in the same time windows was associated with increased risks of LR and CR in children, with smaller size fraction of PM showing greater associations. The negative associations between prenatal and postnatal NDVI and LR and CR in preschool children remained robust after adjusting for concomitant exposure to PM, whereas the associations of postnatal NDVI and rhinitis showed significant interactions with PM. At lower levels of PM, postnatal NDVI remained negatively associated with rhinitis and was partly mediated by PM (10.0-40.9\u00a0%), while at higher levels of PM, the negative associations disappeared or even turned positive. The cut-off levels of PM were identified for each size fraction of PM. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to greenness had robust impacts in lowering the risk of childhood rhinitis, while postnatal exposure to greenness depended on the co-exposure levels to PM. This study revealed the complex interplay of greenness and PM on rhinitis in children.

The surface texture of the hybrid nanomaterials was examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The FE-SEM image revealed the bulk of the spherically shaped particles and the aggregated tiny granules. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed Ti, Pd, C, and O. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the gelatin-coated TiO2/Pd to be in the anatase form. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy examined the interactions among the gelatin-coated TiO2/Pd nanoparticles. The gelatin-coated TiO2/Pd nanomaterials exhibited high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (22 mm) and Bacillus subtilis (17 mm) compared to individual nanoparticles, confirming the synergistic effect. More importantly, the gelatin-coated TiO2/Pd hybrid nanomaterial exhibited remarkable cytotoxic effects on A549 lung cancer cells which shows a linear increase with the concentration of the nanomaterial. The hybrid nanomaterials displayed higher toxicity to cancer cells than the nanoparticles alone. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells was verified by the generation of reactive oxygen species and nuclear damage. Therefore, gelatin-coated TiO2/Pd nanomaterials have potential uses in treating cancer and bacterial infections.", "Keywords": ["antibacterial activity", "anticancer activity", "gelatin", "palladium nanoparticles", "titanium oxide nanoparticles"], "MeSH terms": ["Titanium", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Humans", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Gelatin", "Palladium", "Escherichia coli", "Nanostructures", "A549 Cells", "Bacillus subtilis", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "X-Ray Diffraction", "Metal Nanoparticles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Periasamy", "Last Name": "Anbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Engineering, Inha University, Incheon 22212, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Muruganantham", "Last Name": "Rethinasabapathy", "Affiliation": "NanoBio High-Tech Materials Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, Inha University, 100 Inha-ro, Incheon 22212, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Anbazhagan", "Last Name": "Sathiyaseelan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, College of Biomedical Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, College of Biomedical Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Myeong-Hyeon", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, College of Biomedical Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si 24341, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sekar", "Last Name": "Vijayakumar", "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University, Weihai 264209, China."}, {"First Name": "Yun Suk", "Last Name": "Huh", "Affiliation": "NanoBio High-Tech Materials Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, Inha University, 100 Inha-ro, Incheon 22212, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2024May13"}, {"PMID": "38787653", "Title": "Super-assembled periodic mesoporous organosilica membranes with hierarchical channels for efficient glutathione sensing.", "Abstract": "Bioinspired nanochannel-based sensors have elicited significant interest because of their excellent sensing performance, and robust mechanical and tunable chemical properties.

The unique hierarchical pore architecture provides a large surface area, abundant reaction sites and plentiful interconnected pathways for rapid ionic transport, contributing to efficient and sensitive detection. Moreover, the thioether groups in nanochannels can be selectively cleaved by GSH to generate hydrophilic thiol groups.

Chitin is a vital structural element in fungal cell wall. Chitin deacetylase (CDA) can transform chitin into chitosan through deacetylation, providing various biological functions across fungal species. Although this modification is widespread in fungi, the biological functions of CDA enzymes in Aspergillus flavus remain largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biofunctions of the CDA family in A. flavus. The A. flavus genome contains six annotated putative chitin deacetylases. We constructed knockout strains targeting each member of the CDA family, including \u0394cda1, \u0394cda2, \u0394cda3, \u0394cda4, \u0394cda5, and \u0394cda6. Functional analyses revealed that the deletion of CDA family members neither significantly affects the chitin content nor exhibits the expected chitin deacetylation function in A. flavus. However, the \u0394cda6 strain displayed distinct phenotypic characteristics compared to the wild-type (WT), including an increased conidia count, decreased mycelium production, heightened aflatoxin production, and impaired seed colonization. Subcellular localization experiments indicated the cellular localization of CDA6 protein within the cell wall of A. flavus filaments. Moreover, our findings highlight the significance of the CBD1 and CBD2 structural domains in mediating the functional role of the CDA6 protein. Overall, we analyzed the gene functions of CDA family in A. flavus, which contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying aflatoxin contamination and lay the groundwork for potential biocontrol strategies targeting A. flavus.", "Keywords": ["Aspergillus flavus", "aflatoxin", "cda6", "chitin deacetylase"], "MeSH terms": ["Aspergillus flavus", "Amidohydrolases", "Aflatoxins", "Fungal Proteins", "Chitin", "Cell Wall"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Key Laboratory of Pathogenic, Fungi and Mycotoxins of Fujian Province, School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Meifang", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Key Laboratory of Pathogenic, Fungi and Mycotoxins of Fujian Province, School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Guoqi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Key Laboratory of Pathogenic, Fungi and Mycotoxins of Fujian Province, School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Shihua", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Key Laboratory of Pathogenic, Fungi and Mycotoxins of Fujian Province, School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "Journal": "Toxins", "PubDate": "2024May09"}, {"PMID": "38786932", "Title": "Enrichment of Nutmeg Essential Oil from Oil-in-Water Emulsions with PAN-Based Membranes.", "Abstract": "This study used polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and heat-treated polyacrylonitrile (H-PAN) membranes to enrich nutmeg essential oils, which have more complex compositions compared with common oils.

IRAIN knockdown decreased the sensitivity of CD34+ CML blasts and cell lines to imatinib, whereas IRAIN overexpression significantly increased sensitivity. Mechanistically, IRAIN downregulates CD44, a membrane receptor favorably affecting TKI resistance, by binding to the nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 to reduce the expression of p65 and phosphorylated p65. Therefore, the demethylating drug decitabine, which upregulates IRAIN, combined with imatinib, formed a dual therapy strategy which can be applied to CML with resistance to TKIs.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell biology", "Molecular biology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xijia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Yutong", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Yizhu", "Last Name": "Lyu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiayin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad Arian", "Last Name": "Hassani", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhijia", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuehong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116044, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinsong", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China."}], "Journal": "iScience", "PubDate": "2024Jun21"}, {"PMID": "38783285", "Title": "Role of LsrR in the regulation of biofilm formation in mammary pathogenic Escherichia coli.", "Abstract": "Mammary Pathogenic Escherichia coli (MPEC) is an important pathogen that can escape the attack of the host immune system through biofilm formation and proliferate in the mammary gland continuously, resulting in mastitis in cows and causing enormous economic losses.

FA can act as electron shuttles to facilitate the reductive dissolution of As-bearing iron (hydr)oxides. However, the influence of FA from different sources on the sequential conversion of Fe/As in As-bearing iron oxides under biotic and abiotic conditions remains unclear. In this work, we exposed prepared As-bearing iron oxides to FAs derived from lignite (FAL) and plant peat (FAP) under anaerobic conditions, tracked the fate of Fe and As in the aqueous phase, and investigated the reduction transformation of Fe(III)/As(V) with or without the presence of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The results showed that the reduction efficiency of Fe(III)/As(V) was increased by MR-1, through its metabolic activity and using FAs as electron shuttles. The reduction of Fe(III)/As(V) was closely associated with goethite being more conducive to Fe/As reduction compared to hematite. It is determined that functional groups such as hydroxy, carboxy, aromatic, aldehyde, ketone and aliphatic groups are the primary electron donors. Their reductive capacities rank in the following sequence: hydroxy> carboxy, aromatic, aldehyde, ketone> aliphatic group. Notably, our findings suggest that in the biotic reduction, Fe significantly reduction precedes As reduction, thereby influencing the latter's reduction process across all incubation systems.

Recent research suggests that different types of cell death are implicated in early brain injury (EBI) after SAH, and this has been recognised as a major factor impacting the prognosis of SAH. Ferroptosis, which is a recently identified imbalance of iron metabolism and programmed cell death triggered by phospholipid peroxidation, has been shown to be involved in EBI after SAH and is thought to have a significant impact on EBI. The decomposition of cleaved haemoglobin during SAH involves the release of enormous amounts of free iron, resulting in iron metabolism disorders. Potential therapeutic targets for the signalling pathways of iron metabolism disorders and ferroptosis after SAH are constantly being discovered. To serve as a guide for research into other possible therapeutic targets, this paper will briefly describe the mechanisms of dysregulated iron metabolism and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of SAH and highlight how they are involved in the development and promotion of EBI in SAH.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "Early brain injury", "Ferroptosis", "Iron metabolism", "Neuroinflammation", "Subarachnoid haemorrhage"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shihao", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziwen", "Last Name": "Jing", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Lele", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaocong", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaopeng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Hepingxi Road, Shijiazhuang, 050000, Hebei, China. wang_xp07@126.com."}], "Journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "PubDate": "2024May23"}, {"PMID": "38777790", "Title": "Fluoride Ions Post-Treatment Regulates Interfacial Charge Separation and Transport to Promote Solar Water Splitting of Bismuth Vanadate.", "Abstract": "Herein, we propose a simple and effective fluoride (F-) ions post-treatment method to improve the solar water splitting performance of BVO. The surface modification of BVO with functional F- ions not only facilitates the transfer and separation efficiency of carriers at the electrode/electrolyte interface but also promotes the adsorption and activation of water, resulting in a photocurrent of 3.2 mA/cm2 at a bias voltage of 1.2 VRHE. Furthermore, the transfer and separation of carriers in the bulk and on the surface are further regulated by the oxygen vacancies induced by F- ions, thereby enhancing the PEC water splitting performance of BVO. Notably, the experimental findings demonstrate that the inclusion of F- ions in the KBi electrolyte enhances the photo-charging process of BVO. Specifically, at a bias voltage of 0.6 VRHE, the BVO-0.12F sample exhibits a stable photocurrent of 1.2 mA/cm2, which is twice as high as that of the initial BVO sample. Remarkably, our study unveils that the addition of F- ions into the KBi electrolyte solution plays a pivotal role in facilitating the separation of charge carriers and promoting interfacial charge transport.

Using both in vivo and in vitro viral infection assays, we demonstrated that PTEN\u03b1 restricted the host innate immune response, relying on its RNA-binding capacity and phosphatase activity. Mechanistically, PTEN\u03b1 directly bound to viral RNA and enzymatically converted its 5'-triphosphate to 5'-monophosphate, thereby reducing RIG-I sensitivity.

Unfortunately, irreversible surface oxygen evolution evokes the pernicious phase transition, structural deterioration, and severe electrode-electrolyte interface side reaction with element dissolution, resulting in fast capacity and voltage fading of LMROs during cycling and hindering its commercialization. Herein, a redox couple strategy is proposed by utilizing copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) to address the irreversibility of anionic redox. The Cu-N synergistic effect of CuPc could not only inhibit surface oxygen evolution by reducing the peroxide ion O2 2- back to lattice oxygen O2-, but also enhance the reaction activity and reversibility of anionic redox in bulk to achieve a higher capacity and cycling stability. Moreover, the CuPc strategy suppresses the interface side reaction and induces the forming of a uniform and robust LiF-rich cathode electrolyte, interphase (CEI) to significantly eliminate transition metal dissolution. As a result, the CuPc-enhanced LMRO cathode shows superb cycling performance with a capacity retention of 95.0% after 500 long-term cycles. This study sheds light on the great effect of N-based redox couple to regulate anionic redox behavior and promote the development of high energy density and high stability LMROs cathode.", "Keywords":

Enzymatic shuttles, particularly adenylate kinase (AK) and creatine kinase (CK), are pivotal in the efficient transfer of intracellular ATP, showing distinct tissue- and species-specificity. Here, the expression profiles of AK and CK were investigated in mice and found to fall into four subgroups, of which Subgroup III AKs were observed to be unique to the male reproductive system and conserved across chordates. Both AK8 and AK9 were found to be indispensable to male reproduction after analysis of an infertile male cohort. Knockout mouse models showed that AK8 and AK9 were central to promoting sperm motility. Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry revealed that AK8 and AK9 interact with the radial spoke (RS) of the axoneme. Examination of various human and mouse sperm samples with substructural damage, including the presence of multiple RS subunits, showed that the head of radial spoke 3 acts as an adapter for AK9 in the flagellar axoneme. Using an ATP probe together with metabolomic analysis, it was found that AK8 and AK9 cooperatively regulated ATP transfer in the axoneme, and were concentrated at sites associated with energy consumption in the flagellum. These findings indicate a novel function for RS beyond its structural role, namely, the regulation of ATP transfer. In conclusion, the results expand the functional spectrum of AK proteins and suggest a fresh model regarding ATP transfer within mammalian flagella.", "Keywords": ["AK8", "AK9", "Subgroup III AKs",

Herein, we propose a sub micro-nano-structured Si based material to address the persistent challenge of mechanic-electrochemical coupling issue during cycling. The mesoporous Si-based composite submicrospheres (M-Si/SiO2/CS) with a high Si/SiO2content of 84.6 wt.% is prepared by magnesiothermic reduction of mesoporous SiO2submicrospheres followed by carbon coating process. M-Si/SiO2/CS anode can maintain a high specific capacity of 740 mAh g-1at 0.5 A g-1after 100 cycles with a lower electrode thickness swelling rate of 63%, and exhibits a good long-term cycling stability of 570 mAh g-1at 1 A g-1after 250 cycles. This remarkable Li-storage performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the hierarchical structure and SiO2frameworks. The spherical structure mitigates stress/strain caused by the lithiation/delithiation, while the internal mesopores provide buffer space for Si expansion and obviously shorten the diffusion path for electrolyte/ions. Additionally, the amorphous SiO2matrix not only servers as support for structure stability, but also facilitates the rapid formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer.

P. australis population displays inconsistent ecological performances, highlighting the need to uncover their survival strategies and mechanisms in tidal flats with diverse soil salinities. Upon comparing functional traits of P. australis at multiple tidal flats (low, middle, and high) and their responses to soil physicochemical properties, this study aimed to clarify the salt-tolerant strategy of P. australis and the corresponding mechanisms. These results showed that leaf characteristics, such as specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content, demonstrated more robust stability to soil salinity than shoot height and dry weight. Furthermore, as salt stress intensified, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxisome (POD) in P. australis leaves at low tidal flat exhibited an increased upward trend compared to those at other tidal flats. The molecular mechanism of salt tolerance in Phragmites australis across various habitats was investigated using transcriptome sequencing. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) combined with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screened out 3 modules closely related to high salt tolerance and identified 105 core genes crucial for high salt tolerance. Further research was carried out on the few degraded populations at low tidal flat, and 25 core genes were identified by combining WGCNA and DEGs. A decrease in the activity of ferroptosis marker gonyautoxin-4 and an increase in the content of Fe3+ in the degenerated group were observed, indicating that ferroptosis might participate in degradation. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated a possible regulatory network between salt tolerance and ferroptosis.

The identification of drought stress regulatory genes is essential for the genetic improvement of maize yield. Deoxyribonucleic acid binding with one finger (Dof), a plant-specific transcription factor family, is involved in signal transduction, morphogenesis, and environmental stress responses. In present study, by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene co-expression network analysis, 15 putative Dof genes were identified from maize that respond to drought and rewatering. A real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that these 15 genes were strongly induced by drought and ABA treatment, and among them ZmDof22 was highly induced by drought and ABA treatment. Its expression level increased by nearly 200 times after drought stress and more than 50 times after ABA treatment. After the normal conditions were restored, the expression levels were nearly 100 times and 40 times of those before treatment, respectively.

Continuous antigen stimulation disrupts the expansion, effector function, and metabolic fitness of CD8+ T cells, leading to their differentiation into an exhausted state within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While the function of the cell cycle negative regulator p16 in senescent cells is well understood, its role in T cell exhaustion remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that TCR stimulation of CD8+ T cells rapidly upregulates p16 expression, with its levels positively correlating with TCR affinity. Chronic TCR stimulation further increased p16 expression, leading to CD8+ T cell apoptosis and exhaustion differentiation, without inducing DNA damage or cell senescence. Mechanistic investigations revealed that p16 downregulates mTOR, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) associated gene expression, resulting in impaired mitochondrial fitness, reduced T cell viability, and diminished effector function. Furthermore, the deletion of p16 significantly enhances the persistence of CD8+ T cells within tumors and suppresses the terminal exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Overall, our findings elucidate how increased p16 expression reshapes T cell intracellular metabolism, drives T cell apoptosis and exhaustion differentiation, and ultimately impairs T cell anti-tumor function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Apoptosis", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16", "Animals", "Mice", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Cell Differentiation", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Glycolysis", "T-Cell Exhaustion"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiajia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Shengtao", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. guofeng27@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Lianjun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. zlj@ism.cams.cn."}, {"First Name": "Kaili", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Immunity and Inflammation, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. mkl@ism.cams.cn."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2024May15"}, {"PMID": "38745751", "Title": "Hepatitis B: Model Systems and Therapeutic Approaches.", "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health issue and ranks among the top causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Here, we showed that OTP can relieve microglia activation by reducing harmful microbial metabolites lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that alleviate CRD-induced cognitive decline. Mechanistically, OTP suppressed the inflammation response by regulating the gut microbiota composition, including upregulating the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae and Clostridia_UCG-014 and downregulating Desulfovibrio, promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Moreover, the use of OTP alleviated intestinal barrier damage and decreased the LPS transport to the serum. These results further inhibited the activation of microglia, thus alleviating cognitive impairment by inhibiting neuroinflammation, neuron damage, and neurotoxicity metabolite glutamate elevation. Meanwhile, OTP upregulated the expression of synaptic plasticity-related protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYN) by elevating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level.

However, they face challenges stemming from insufficient surface charge density, which impairs both permselectivity and durability. Herein, we present a novel vacancy-engineered, oxygen-deficient NiCo layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH)/cellulose nanofibers-wrapped carbon nanotubes (VOLDH/CNF-CNT) composite membrane. This membrane, featuring abundant angstrom-scale, cation-selective nanochannels, is designed and fabricated through a synergistic combination of vacancy engineering and interfacial super-assembly. The composite membrane shows interlayer free-spacing of ~3.62\u2005\u00c5, which validates the membrane size exclusion selectivity. This strategy, validated by DFT calculations and experimental data, improves hydrophilicity and surface charge density, leading to the strong interaction with K+ ions to benefit the low ion transport resistance and exceptional charge selectivity. When employed in an artificial river water|seawater salinity gradient power generator, it delivers a high-power density of 5.35\u2005W/m2 with long-term durability (20,000s), which is almost 400\u2009% higher than that of the pristine NiCoLDH membrane. Furthermore, it displays both pH- and temperature-sensitive ion transport behavior, offering additional opportunities for optimization.

Neutrophils are the major components of white blood cells in circulation and play a vital role in innate immunity while fighting against infections, and are considered a feature determining sepsis classification. There's a plethora of basic research detailing neutrophil functioning, among which, the study of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is providing novel insights into mechanisms and treatments of sepsis. This review explores their functions, dysfunctions, and influences in the context of sepsis. The interplay between neutrophils and the human microbiome and the impact of DNA methylation on neutrophil function in sepsis are crucial areas of study. The interaction between neutrophils and the human microbiome is complex, particularly in the context of sepsis where dysbiosis may occur. We highlight the importance of deciphering neutrophil's functional alterations and their epigenetic features in sepsis because it is critical for defining sepsis endotypes and opening up the possibility for novel diagnostic methods and therapy. Specifically, epigenetic signatures are pivotal since they will provide a novel implication for sepsis diagnostic method when used in combination with the cell-free DNA (cfDNA).

Industrial emissions of VOCs often include the presence of water vapor, which, in turn, diminishes the adsorption capacity and efficacy of adsorbents. This occurs due to the competitive adsorption of water vapor, which competes with target pollutants for adsorption sites on the adsorbent material. In this study, hydrophobic activated carbons (BMIMPF6-AC (L), BMIMPF6-AC (g), and BMIMPF6-AC-H) were successfully prepared using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6) to adsorb toluene under humidity environment. The adsorption performance and mechanism of the resulting ionic liquid-modified activated carbon for toluene in a high-humidity environment were evaluated to explore the potential application of ionic liquids as hydrophobic modifiers. The results indicated that BMIMPF6-AC-H exhibited superior hydrophobicity. The toluene adsorption capacity of BMIMPF6-AC-H was 1.53 times higher than that of original activated carbon, while the adsorption capacity for water vapor was only 37.30% of it at 27 \u00b0C and 77% RH. The Y-N model well-fitted the dynamic adsorption experiments. To elucidate the microscopic mechanism of hydrophobic modification, the Independent Gradient Model (IGM) method was employed to characterize the intermolecular interactions between BMIMPF6 and toluene.

However, their specific function in cotton's response to drought stress has not been well understood. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the SDG gene family in Gossypium hirsutum, identifying a total of 82 SDG genes. An evolutionary analysis revealed that the SDG gene family can be divided into eight subgroups. The expression analysis shows that some GhSDG genes are preferentially expressed in specific tissues, indicating their involvement in cotton growth and development. The transcription level of some GhSDG genes is induced by PEG, with GhSDG59 showing significant upregulation upon polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that the accumulation of transcripts of the GhSDG59 gene was significantly upregulated under drought stress. Further functional studies using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) revealed that silencing GhSDG59 reduced cotton tolerance to drought stress. Under drought conditions, the proline content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activities in the GhSDG59-silenced plants were significantly lower than in the control plants, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly higher. Transcriptome sequencing showed that silencing the GhSDG59 gene led to significant changes in the expression levels of 1156 genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in the carbon metabolism and the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. The functional annotation analysis identified known drought-responsive genes, such as ERF, CIPK, and WRKY, among these DEGs. This indicates that GhSDG59 is involved in the drought-stress response in cotton by affecting the expression of genes related to the carbon metabolism and the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways, as well as known drought-responsive genes.

excessive mitochondrial fission, insulin resistance, and inflammation in the muscles of diabetic rats. The role of the irisin/AMPK pathway in regulating exercise effects was also determined. Thirty-two 8-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n\u2009=\u20098 per group): one control group (Con) and three experimental groups. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced in the experimental groups via a high-fat diet followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dosage of 30\u00a0mg/kg body weight. After T2DM induction, groups were assigned as sedentary (DM), subjected to 8\u00a0weeks of treadmill exercise training (Ex), or exercise training combined with 8-week cycloRGDyk treatment (ExRg). Upon completion of the last training session, all rats were euthanized and samples of fasting blood and soleus muscle were collected for analysis using ELISA, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting. Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and differences between two groups were assessed using t-tests. Our findings demonstrate that exercise training markedly ameliorated hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and insulin resistance in diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). It also mitigated the disarranged morphology and inflammation of skeletal muscle associated with T2DM (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Crucially, exercise training suppressed muscular excessive mitochondrial fission in the soleus muscle of diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and enhanced irisin and p-AMPK levels significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, exercise-induced irisin and p-AMPK expression were inhibited by cycloRGDyk treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the administration of CycloRGDyk blocked the effects of exercise training in reducing excessive mitochondrial fission and inflammation in the soleus muscle of diabetic rats, as well as the positive effects of exercise training on improving hyperlipidemia and insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). These results indicate that regular exercise training effectively ameliorates insulin resistance and glucolipid metabolic dysfunction, and reduces inflammation in skeletal muscle. These benefits are partially mediated by reductions in mitochondrial fission through the irisin/AMPK signalling pathway.", "Keywords": ["Diabetes", "Exercise training", "Inflammation", "Irisin", "Mitochondrial fission"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Male", "Rats", "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fibronectins", "Inflammation", "Insulin Resistance", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Physical Conditioning, Animal", "Rats, Wistar", "Signal Transduction", "Streptozocin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junjie", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Haocheng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanxin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Baishu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China."}, {"First Name": "Renqing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "College of Physical Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China. renqing.zhao@yzu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2024May09"}, {"PMID": "38722189", "Title": "Ionic Effect on the Microenvironment of Biomolecular Condensates.", "Abstract": "Biomolecules such as proteins and RNA could organize to form condensates with distinct microenvironments through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Recent works have demonstrated that the microenvironment of biomolecular condensates plays a crucial role in mediating biological activities, such as the partition of biomolecules, and the subphase organization of the multiphasic condensates. Ions could influence the phase transition point of LLPS, following the Hofmeister series. However, the ion-specific effect on the microenvironment of biomolecular condensates remains unknown. In this study, we utilized fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and microrheology techniques to investigate the ion effect on the microenvironment of condensates. We found that ions significantly affect the microenvironment of biomolecular condensates: salting-in ions increase micropolarity and reduce the microviscosity of the condensate, while salting-out ions induce opposing effects. Furthermore, we manipulate the miscibility and multilayering behavior of condensates through ion-specific effects. In summary, our work provides the first quantitative survey of the microenvironment of protein condensates in the presence of ions from the Hofmeister series, demonstrating how ions impact micropolarity, microviscosity, and viscoelasticity of condensates.

We found that MSL3P1 is overexpressed in LUAD tumor tissues, which is significantly associated with clinical characteristics, metastasis, and poor clinical prognosis. MSL3P1 promotes the metastasis of LUAD in vitro and in vivo. The enhancer reprogramming in LUAD tumor tissue is the major driver of the aberrantly expression of MSL3P1. Mechanistically, due to the competitive binding to CUL3 mRNA with ZFC3H1 protein (a protein involved in targeting polyadenylated RNA to exosomes and promoting the degradation of target mRNA), MSL3P1 can prevent the ZFC3H1-mediated RNA degradation of CUL3 mRNA and transport it to the cytoplasm. This activates the downstream epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signaling pathway, and promote tumor invasion and metastasis.

The cyclic guanosine-adenosine synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and NF-\u03baB pathway are two important signaling pathways involved in the innate immune response. The cGAS-STING pathway is activated by the recognition of intracellular DNA, which triggers the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. These cytokines play a role in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. The NF-\u03baB pathway is activated by various stimuli, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, viral particle components, and neurotoxins. NF-\u03baB activation may lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promote neuroinflammation and cause neuronal damage. A potential interaction exists between the cGAS-STING and NF-\u03baB pathways, and NF-\u03baB activation blocks STING degradation by inhibiting microtubule-mediated STING transport.

The optimal calcination conditions for the zeolite were 332 \u00b0C, 1.8 h, and 10-20 mm size, and the maximum adsorption capacity of H2S was approximately 6219 mg kg-1. Calcination could broaden the channels, remove the adsorbed gases and impurities on the surface of zeolites, and increase the average pore size and point of zero net charge. As the zeolite adsorbed to saturation, it could be regenerated at the temperatures between 200 and 350 \u00b0C for 0.5 h. Compared with the natural zeolite, the adsorption capacities of dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, toluene, CH3SH, CS2, CO2, and H2S were significantly higher on the calcined zeolite, while the adsorption capacity of CH4 was lower on the calcined zeolite.

In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate two OsPRMT6a loss-of-function mutants that exhibit\u00a0various abnormal spikelet structures. Interestingly, we found that OsPRMT6a can methylate arginine residues in JA signal repressors OsJAZ1 and OsJAZ7. We showed that arginine methylation of OsJAZ1 enhances the binding affinity of OsJAZ1 with the JA receptors OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b in the presence of JAs, thereby promoting the ubiquitination of OsJAZ1 by the SCFOsCOI1a/OsCOI1b complex and degradation via the 26S proteasome. This process ultimately releases OsMYC2, a core transcriptional regulator in the JA signaling pathway, to activate or repress JA-responsive genes, thereby maintaining normal plant (spikelet) development. However, in the osprmt6a-1 mutant, reduced arginine methylation of OsJAZ1 impaires the interaction between OsJAZ1 and OsCOI1a/OsCOI1b in the presence of JAs. As a result, OsJAZ1 proteins become more stable, repressing JA responses, thus causing the formation of abnormal spikelet structures. Moreover, we discovered that JA signaling reduces the OsPRMT6a mRNA level in an OsMYC2-dependent manner, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop to balance JA signaling. We further found that OsPRMT6a-mediated arginine methylation of OsJAZ1 likely serves as a switch to tune JA signaling to maintain normal spikelet development under harsh environmental conditions such as high temperatures. Collectively, our study establishes a direct molecular link between arginine methylation and JA signaling in rice.", "Keywords": ["adaptation to heat stress", "jasmonate signaling", "negative feedback

The accurate and fast identification of pathogenic microorganisms is especially important for diagnosing infections. Herein, three tetraphenylethylene derivatives (S-TDs: TBN, TPN, and TPI) featuring different cationic groups, charge numbers, emission wavelengths, and hydrophobicities were successfully synthesized. Benefiting from distinct cell wall binding properties, S-TDs were collectively utilized to create a sensor array capable of imaging various microorganisms through their characteristic fluorescent signatures. Furthermore, the interaction mechanism between S-TDs and different microorganisms was explored by calculating the binding energy between S-TDs and cell membrane/wall constituents, including phospholipid bilayer and peptidoglycan.

Dimensionality reduction is an important step in the trajectory inference process.

These methods are not specifically designed for trajectory inference and fail to fully leverage prior information from upstream analysis, limiting their performance. Here, we introduce scCRT, a novel dimensionality reduction model for trajectory inference. In order to utilize prior information to learn accurate cells representation, scCRT integrates two feature learning components: a cell-level pairwise module and a cluster-level contrastive module. The cell-level module focuses on learning accurate cell representations in a reduced-dimensionality space while maintaining the cell-cell positional relationships in the original space. The cluster-level contrastive module uses prior cell state information to aggregate similar cells, preventing excessive dispersion in the low-dimensional space. Experimental findings from 54 real and 81 synthetic datasets, totaling 135 datasets, highlighted the superior performance of scCRT compared with commonly used trajectory inference methods. Additionally, an ablation study revealed that both cell-level and cluster-level modules enhance the model's ability to learn accurate cell features, facilitating cell lineage inference.

Our in vivo experiments showed that continuous intraperitoneal injection of GnIH not only significantly increased the concentration of stress hormones in serum, but also significantly elevated the mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the duodenum and jejunum.

However, simultaneously achieving a low solid content and printability of MXene inks, as well as mechanical flexibility and environmental stability of printed objects, remains a challenge. In this study, we overcame these challenges by employing high-viscosity aramid nanofibers (ANFs) to optimize the rheology of low-concentration MXene inks. The abundant entangled networks and hydrogen bonds formed between MXene and ANF significantly increase the viscosity and yield stress up to 103 Pa\u00b7s and 200 Pa, respectively. This optimization allows the use of MXene/ANF (MA) inks at low concentrations in direct ink writing and other high-viscosity processing techniques. The printable MXene/ANF inks with a high conductivity of 883.5 S/cm were used to print shields with customized structures, achieving a tunable electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) in the 0.2-48.2 dB range.

Cellulose, a typical biomass material, stands out as the primary choice for producing eco-friendly packaging materials. However, it is still a challenge to efficiently utilize cellulose from waste biomass materials in practice. Herein, cellulose-based films were prepared by pretreating waste corn straw, separating straw husk, straw pith and straw leaf, and extracting cellulose through alkali and sodium chlorite treatment to improve its mechanical properties using the cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) method in this work. The prepared composite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffraction instrument (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric (TG) and mechanical properties. The results indicated that corn straw husk exhibited the highest cellulose content of 31.67\u00a0wt%, and obtained husk cellulose had the highest crystallinity of 52.5\u00a0%. Compared to corn straw, the crystallinity of husk cellulose, pith cellulose and leaf cellulose increased by 19.5\u00a0%, 16.4\u00a0% and 44.1\u00a0%, respectively. Husk cellulose/PVA composite films were the most thermally stable, with a maximum weight loss temperature of 346.8\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, the husk cellulose/PVA composite film had the best tensile strength of 37\u00a0MPa. Meanwhile, the composite films had good UV shielding, low water vapor transmission rate and biodegradability.

Catheter ablation of AF has been proven to be superior to antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy regarding efficacy and improvement of survival in patients with heart failure. PVI has become a routine treatment procedure in recent decades especially for patients with symptomatic PAF. Recent research investigations have shown that AF recurrence still occurs in a significant number of patients after ablation. AF recurrence leads to a decrease in patients' quality of life and is related to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. As most arrhythmia recurrences take place within the first 3 months after the initial procedure, this time period is seen as a so-called \"blanking period\", in which ablation is not recommended, since up to 50 % of patients can become arrhythmia free in the long run. Ablation therapy, however, is less successful in patients suffering from long standing persistent AF, with a 20.3 % success rate after a single procedure and a 45 % success rate after multiple RFA procedures.

In this study, based on the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, two metabolites of DEHTP, i.e., mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) terephthalate (MEHHTP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) terephthalate (MECPTP), were found to be present in the urine samples of nearly all representative U.S. adults. Moreover, a positive linear correlation was observed between the concentrations of the two metabolites and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the population. Results of weighted quantile sum and Bayesian kernel machine regression indicated that MEHHTP contributed a greater weight to the risk of NAFLD in comparison with 12 conventional phthalate metabolites. In vitro experiments with hepatocyte HepG2 revealed that MEHHTP exposure could increase lipogenic gene programs, thereby promoting a dose-dependent hepatic lipid accumulation.

During the early phase of liver injury, SMF markedly reduced APAP-induced oxidative stress, free radicals, and liver damage, resulting in a reduction in multiple oxidative stress markers and an increase in the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). During the later stage of liver recovery, application of vertically downward SMF increased DNA synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation. Moreover, the combination of NAC and SMF significantly mitigated liver damage induced by high-dose APAP and increased liver recovery, even 24 h post overdose, when the effectiveness of NAC alone substantially declines.

The development of feasible tools for quantitative detection of changes in the cellular environment is crucial for investigating the process of protein conformational variations. Here, we have developed a near-infrared AIE probe based on the rhodamine fluorophore, which exhibits dual responses of fluorescence intensity and lifetime to local viscosity changes. Notably, computational analysis reveals that NRhFluors fluorescence activation is due to inhibition of the RACI mechanism in viscous environment. In the chemical regulation of rhodamine fluorophores, we found that variations of electron density distribution can effectively regulate CI states and achieve fluorescence sensitivity of NRhFluors. In addition, combined with the AggTag method, the lifetime of probe A9-Halo exhibits a positive correlation with viscosity changes. This analytical capacity allows us to quantitatively monitor protein conformational changes using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to reduced protein expression in HEK293 cells.

Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that OsSCYL2 was consistently expressed throughout the germination process in rice. Exogenous application of ABA on seeds and seedlings underscored the sensitivity of OsSCYL2 to ABA during both seed germination initiation and post-germination growth phases. Transcriptomic profiling following OsSCYL2 overexpression revealed profound alterations in metabolic pathways, MAPK signaling cascades, and phytohormone-mediated signal transduction pathways, with 15 genes related to the ABA pathways exhibiting significant expression changes. Complementary in vivo and in vitro assays unveiled the physical interaction between OsSCYL2 and TOR, thereby implicating OsSCYL2 in the negative modulation of ABA-responsive genes and its consequential impact on seed germination dynamics.

However, the role and expression of motilin are poorly understood during starvation and the weaning stage, which is of great importance in the seeding cultivation of fish. In this study, the sequences of Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus Motilin (AdMotilin)) motilin receptor (AdMotilinR) were cloned and characterized. The results of tissue expression showed that by contrast with mammals, AdMotilin mRNA was richly expressed in the brain, whereas AdMotilinR was highly expressed in the stomach, duodenum, and brain. Weaning from a natural diet of T. Limnodrilus to commercial feed significantly promoted the expression of AdMotilin in the brain during the period from day 1 to day 10, and after re-feeding with T. Limnodrilus the change in expression of AdMotilin was partially reversed. Similarly, it was revealed that fasting increased the expression of AdMotilin in the brain (3 h, 6 h) and duodenum (3 h), and the expression of AdMotilinR in the brain (1 h) in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that peripheral injection of motilin-NH2 increased food intake and the filling index of the digestive tract in the Yangtze sturgeon, which was accompanied by the changes of AdMotilinR and appetite factors expression in the brain (POMC, CART, AGRP, NPY and CCK) and stomach (CCK). These results indicate that motilin acts as an indicator of nutritional status, and also serves as a novel orexigenic factor that stimulates food intake in Acipenser dabryanus.

However, the characteristics of VOC emissions from vehicles with strict emission limits are poorly understood. This study investigated the VOC emission characteristics from vehicles under the latest standards based on tunnel measurements, and identified future control strategies for vehicle emissions. The results showed that the highest percentage of VOCs from vehicle consisted of alkanes (80.9\u00a0%), followed by aromatics (15.8\u00a0%) and alkenes (3.1\u00a0%). Alkanes had the most significant ozone formation potential due to their high concentrations, in contrast to the aromatics that have been dominant in previous studies. The measured fleet-average VOC emission factor was 71.3\u00a0mg\u00b7km-1, including tailpipe emissions of 39.6\u00a0mg\u00b7km-1 and evaporative emissions of 31.7\u00a0mg\u00b7km-1.

Additionally, the existing method can not be used for challenging genome loci (eg, copy number variations, deletions, inversions, or gene recombinants) or on families without proband genotype. This study assessed the performance of relative haplotype dosage analysis (RHDO)-based NIPD for identifying fetal genotyping in pregnancies at risk of ARNSHL. Fifty couples carrying pathogenic variants associated with ARNSHL in either GJB2 or SLC26A4 were recruited. The RHDO-based targeted linked-read sequencing combined with whole gene coverage probes was used to genotype the fetal cell-free DNA of 49 families who met the quality control standard. Fetal amniocyte samples were genotyped using invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD) to assess the performance of NIPD. The NIPD results showed 100% (49/49) concordance with those obtained through IPD. Two families with copy number variation and recombination were also successfully identified. Sufficient specific informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms for haplotyping, as well as the fetal cell-free DNA concentration and sequencing depth, are prerequisites for RHDO-based NIPD. This method has the merits of covering the entire genes of GJB2 and SLC26A4, qualifying for copy number variation and recombination analysis with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, it has clinical potential as an alternative to traditional IPD for ARNSHL.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Sulfate Transporters", "Haplotypes", "Female", "Connexin 26", "Pregnancy", "Alleles", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Noninvasive Prenatal Testing", "Connexins", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Deafness", "Genotype", "Male", "Genes, Recessive", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Membrane Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Senior Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The 6th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Chinese PLA Medical School, Beijing, China;

A total of 17,739 patients were included, involving 8482 H2RAs users and 9257 non-H2RAs users.

In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as-cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as-cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY-TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8-BO blend to form a double-fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY-TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8-BO:PY-TPT-based device, affording a record-high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post-treatment. Moreover, green solvent-processed devices, thick-film (300\u00a0nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm2) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively.

Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8' and 5' positions is important to control the lifetime for the green-emitting and red-emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo-induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8' and 5' positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal.

Detectable through sensitive neuroimaging techniques, CMHs reveal an extensive pathological landscape. They are prevalent in the aging population, with multiple CMHs often being observed in a given individual. CMHs are closely associated with accelerated cognitive decline and are increasingly recognized as key contributors to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review paper delves into the hypothesis that atherosclerosis, a prevalent age-related large vessel disease, extends its pathological influence into the cerebral microcirculation, thereby contributing to the development and progression of CSVD, with a specific focus on CMHs. We explore the concept of vascular aging as a continuum, bridging macrovascular pathologies like atherosclerosis with microvascular abnormalities characteristic of CSVD. We posit that the same risk factors precipitating accelerated aging in large vessels (i.e., atherogenesis), primarily through oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, similarly instigate accelerated microvascular aging. Accelerated microvascular aging leads to increased microvascular fragility, which in turn predisposes to the formation of CMHs. The presence of hypertension and amyloid pathology further intensifies this process. We comprehensively overview the current body of evidence supporting this interconnected vascular hypothesis. Our review includes an examination of epidemiological data, which provides insights into the prevalence and impact of CMHs in the context of atherosclerosis and CSVD.

The role of prostaglandins (PGs) in menstruation has long been proposed in humans, and the rate-limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase was shown to play a key role in endometrial breakdown and shedding in a mouse menstrual-like model in our previous study. However, the specific types of PGs involved and their respective roles remain unclear. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the mechanism through which PGs regulate endometrial disintegration. In this study, the microscopy was observed by HE; the protein levels of prostaglandins E1 (PGE1), prostaglandins E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) and Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) were detected by ELISA; the mRNA level of Pfgfr2, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor(Vegf), Angiostatin and Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (Hif1\u03b1) were examined by real-time PCR; PTGFR Receptor (PTGFR), VEGF, Angiostatin and HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels were investigated by western blotting; the locations of protein were observed by Immunohistochemistry; HIF-1\u03b1 binding PTGFR promoter was detected by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real-time PCR. We found that the concentrations of PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2\u03b1 all increased significantly during this process. Furthermore, Ptgfr mRNA increased soon after Progesterone (P4) withdrawal, and PTGFR protein levels increased significantly during abundant endometrial breakdown and shedding processes. PTGFR inhibitors AL8810 significantly suppressed endometrial breakdown and shedding, promoted Angiostatin expression, and reduced VEGF-A expressions and vascular permeability. And HIF-1\u03b1 and PTGFR were mainly located in the luminal/gland epithelium, vascular endothelium, and pre-decidual zone. Interestingly, HIF-1\u03b1 directly bound to Ptgfr promoter. Moreover, a HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) significantly reduced PTGFR expression and suppressed endometrial breakdown which was in accord with PTGFR inhibitor's effect. Similar changes occurred in human stromal cells relevant to menstruation in vitro. Our study provides evidence that PGF2\u03b1/PTGFR plays a vital role in endometrial breakdown via vascular changes that are regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 during menstruation.", "Keywords": ["Capillary permeability", "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1", "Menstruation", "Prostaglandin receptor", "Prostaglandins F"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shufang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Forensic Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan Province, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhong", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Human Sperm Bank, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xihua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Reproductive Physiology Laboratory, NHC Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health Engineering Technology Research, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shige", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiangxu", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Siyu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zeyi", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Reproductive Physiology Laboratory, NHC Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health Engineering Technology Research, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Taifeng", "Last Name": "Zhuang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Maternal &.

However, they usually show poor rate performance due to the sluggish Na+ kinetics at the heterointerfaces of the composites. Here, a 3D MXene-reduced holey graphene oxide (MXene-RHGO) composite electrode with Ti\u2500O\u2500C bonding at 2D heterointerfaces of MXene and RHGO is developed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the built-in electric fields (BIEFs) are enhanced by the formation of bridged interfacial Ti\u2500O\u2500C bonding, that lead to not only faster diffusion of Na+ at the heterointerfaces but also faster adsorption and migration of Na+ on the MXene surfaces. As a result, the 3D composite electrodes show impressive properties for fast Na+ storage. Under high current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm-2, the 3D MXene-RHGO composite electrodes with high mass loading of 10\u00a0mg\u00a0cm-2 achieve a strikingly high and stable areal capacity of 3\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm-2, which is same as commercial LIBs and greatly exceeds that of most reported SIBs electrode materials.

Herein, we proposed a \"reducing expenditure of O2 and broadening sources\" dual-strategy and constructed ultrasmall IrO2@BSA-ATO nanogenerators (NGs) for decreasing the O2-consumption and elevating the O2-supply simultaneously. As O2 NGs, the intrinsic catalase (CAT) activity could precisely decompose the overexpressed H2O2 to produce O2 in situ, enabling exogenous O2 infusion. Moreover, the cell respiration inhibitor atovaquone (ATO) would be at the tumor sites, effectively inhibiting cell respiration and elevating oxygen content for endogenous O2 conservation. As a result, IrO2@BSA-ATO NGs systematically increase tumor oxygenation in dual ways and significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of PDT. Moreover, the extraordinary photothermal conversion efficiency allows the implementation of precise photothermal therapy (PTT) under photoacoustic guidance. Upon a single laser irradiation, this synergistic PDT, PTT, and the following immunosuppression regulation performance of IrO2@BSA-ATO NGs achieved a superior tumor cooperative eradicating capability both in vitro and in vivo.

However, the effects and mechanisms of intestinal tryptophan metabolites on RA are not yet detailed. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of intestinal tryptophan metabolites on RA and its detailed mechanisms. In this study, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was established. Based on metabolomics analysis, the contents of \u03b2-indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indolylpropionic acid, and indole-3-\u03b2-acrylic acid in the sera of CIA rats were significantly less compared with those of the normal rats. Under the condition of Treg or Th17 cell differentiation, IAA significantly promoted the differentiation and activation of Treg cells instead of Th17 cells. Intestinal tryptophan metabolites are well-known endogenic ligands of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Not surprisingly, IAA increased the level of Foxp3 through activating the AhR pathway. Interestingly, IAA had little impact on the level of Foxp3 mRNA, but reducing the ubiquitination and degradation of Foxp3. Mechanically, IAA reduced the expression of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ, which was almost completely reversed by either AhR antagonist CH223191 or siRNA. In vitro, IAA decreased the combination of TAZ and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, while it increased the combination of Tip60 and Foxp3. In CIA rats, oral administration of IAA increased the number of Treg cells and relieved the inflammation. A combined use with CH223191 almost abolished the effect of IAA. Taken together, IAA attenuated CIA by promoting the differentiation of Treg cells through reducing the ubiquitination of Foxp3 via the AhR-TAZ-Tip60 pathway.", "Keywords": ["Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)", "Foxp3", "Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)", "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Treg cell"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoran", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinliu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Chinese and Western Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Chinese and Western Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, China."}, {"First Name": "Yajie", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, China."}, {"First Name": "Yugai", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, China. jiayugaihb@163.com."}], "Journal": "Immunologic research", "PubDate": "2024Apr17"}, {"PMID": "38629632", "Title": "Deciphering the core microbiota in open environment solid-state fermentation of Beijing rice vinegar and its correlation with environmental factors.", "Abstract": "Rice vinegar is a worldwide popular cereal vinegar worldwide and is typically produced in an open environment, and the ecosystem of solid-state fermentation is complicated and robust.

The surface modification of the nanosystem with ibandronate (IBN) facilitates both passive and active targeting, significantly improving the detection rate of bone metastasis and suppressing the bone resorption.

It can be concluded from these findings that BDE-47 activated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, causing imbalanced expression of appetite factors, leading to disordered feeding behavior and decreased food intake in carp.

The new optimal DEE-LHCE exhibits less reactivity against Li2S2, alleviates PS dissolution, forms a better cathode-electrolyte interphase layer on the SPAN cathode, and enhances SPAN structural reversibility even at elevated temperatures (45 \u00b0C). Compared to DME-LHCE, DEE-LHCE with the same salt and diluent leads to better performance in Li||SPAN batteries (with 82.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 45 \u00b0C), preservation of the SPAN cathode structure, and suppression of volume change of the Li metal anode.

The measurement models were separately built using the partial least-squares (PLS) and orthogonal PLS algorithms, and the model parameters were optimized. The results show that after the Savitzky-Golay second derivative preprocessing, the PLS model built using the feature spectra selected by the uninformative variable elimination wavelength algorithm achieved the best measurement performance. Compared with the PLS model without preprocessing, the range of the resulting accuracy improvement was at least 15.01%. Under the optimal model parameters, the calibration set regression coefficient (Rc2) of the 11 jet fuel property index models ranged from 0.9102 to 0.9763, with the root-mean-square error of calibration values up to 0.8468 \u00b0C (for flash points). The regression coefficient (Rp2) of the validation set ranged from 0.8239 to 0.9557, with the root-mean-square error of prediction values up to 1.1354 \u00b0C (for flash points). The ratios of prediction to deviation (RPD) values were all in the range of 1.9-3.0, indicating high accuracy and reliability of the model.

It plays a crucial role in preventing inbreeding and promoting outcrossing. The genes that control self-incompatibility in plants are typically determined by the S-locus female determinant factor and the S-locus male determinant factor. In the Solanaceae family, the male determinant factor is often the SLF gene. In this research, we cloned and analyzed 13 S2-LbSLF genes from the L. barbarum genome, which are located on chromosome 2 and close to the physical location of the S-locus female determinant factor S-RNase, covering a region of approximately 90.4 Mb. The amino acid sequence identity of the 13 S2-LbSLFs is 58.46%, and they all possess relatively conserved motifs and typical F-box domains, without introns. A co-linearity analysis revealed that there are no tandemly repeated genes in the S2-LbSLF genes, and that there are two pairs of co-linear genes between S2-LbSLF and the tomato, which also belongs to the Solanaceae family. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that the S2-LbSLF members can be divided into six groups, and it was found that the 13 S2-LbSLFs are clustered with the SLF genes of tobacco and Petunia inflata to varying degrees, potentially serving as pollen determinant factors regulating self-incompatibility in L. barbarum. The results for the gene expression patterns suggest that S2-LbSLF is only expressed in pollen tissue. The results of the yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the C-terminal region of S2-LbSLFs lacking the F-box domain can interact with S-RNase. This study provides theoretical data for further investigation into the functions of S2-LbSLF members, particularly for the identification of pollen determinant factors regulating self-incompatibility in L. barbarum.", "Keywords": ["F-box gene family", "Lycium barbarum", "S-locus F-box gene", "pollen determinant factor", "self-incompatibility"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiali", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiongxiong", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Efficient Production of Forest Resources, Yinchuan 750004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}, {"First Name": "Wendi", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}, {"First Name": "Haijun", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}, {"First Name": "Zijun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}, {"First Name": "Cuiping", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "Journal": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Mar26"}, {"PMID": "38611482", "Title": "Alfalfa Responses to Intensive Soil Compaction: Effects on Plant and Root Growth, Phytohormones and Internal Gene Expression.", "Abstract": "The perennial legume alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is of high value in providing cheap and high-nutritive forages. Due to a lack of tillage during the production period, the soil in which alfalfa grows prunes to become compacted through highly mechanized agriculture. Compaction deteriorates the soil's structure and fertility, leading to compromised alfalfa development and productivity. However, the way alfalfa responses to different levels of soil compaction and the underlying molecular mechanism are still unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effects of gradient compacted soil on the growth of different cultivars of alfalfa, especially the root system architecture, phytohormones and internal gene expression profile alterations. The results showed that alfalfa growth was facilitated by moderate soil compaction, but drastically inhibited when compaction was intensified. The inhibition effect was universal across different cultivars, but with different severity. Transcriptomic and physiological studies revealed that the expression of a set of genes regulating the biosynthesis of lignin and flavonoids was significantly repressed in compaction treated alfalfa roots, and this might have resulted in a modified secondary cell wall and xylem vessel formation. Phytohormones, like ABA, are supposed to play pivotal roles in the regulation of the overall responses.

Thus, the localisation and mapping accuracy of the SEG-SLAM system is improved. Finally, the rejection results are fused with the depth information, and a static dense 3D mapping without dynamic objects is constructed using the Point Cloud Library.

However, the abundance of spectral information presents certain challenges for data processing, such as the \"curse of dimensionality\" leading to the \"Hughes phenomenon\", \"strong correlation\" due to high resolution, and \"nonlinear characteristics\" caused by varying surface reflectances. Consequently, dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data emerges as a critical task. This paper begins by elucidating the principles and processes of hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction based on manifold theory and learning methods, in light of the nonlinear structures and features present in hyperspectral remote-sensing data, and formulates a dimensionality reduction process based on manifold learning. Subsequently, this study explores the capabilities of feature extraction and low-dimensional embedding for hyperspectral imagery using manifold learning approaches, including principal components analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for linear methods; and isometric mapping (Isomap), locally linear embedding (LLE), Laplacian eigenmaps (LE), Hessian locally linear embedding (HLLE), local tangent space alignment (LTSA), and maximum variance unfolding (MVU) for nonlinear methods, based on the Indian Pines hyperspectral dataset and Pavia University dataset. Furthermore, the paper investigates the optimal neighborhood computation time and overall algorithm runtime for feature extraction in hyperspectral imagery, varying by the choice of neighborhood k and intrinsic dimensionality d values across different manifold learning methods. Based on the outcomes of feature extraction, the study examines the classification experiments of various manifold learning methods, comparing and analyzing the variations in classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient with different selections of neighborhood k and intrinsic dimensionality d values. Building on this, the impact of selecting different bandwidths t for the Gaussian kernel in the LE method and different Lagrange multipliers \u03bb for the MVU method on classification accuracy, given varying choices of neighborhood k and intrinsic dimensionality d, is explored. Through these experiments, the paper investigates the capability and effectiveness of different manifold learning methods in feature extraction and dimensionality reduction within hyperspectral imagery, as influenced by the selection of neighborhood k and intrinsic dimensionality d values, identifying the optimal neighborhood k and intrinsic dimensionality d value for each method. A comparison of classification accuracies reveals that the LTSA method yields superior classification results compared to other manifold learning approaches.

We established an in vivo SAH mice model and overexpressed the p97 protein through transfection of the mouse cerebral cortex. We analyzed the protective effect of p97 on neurons and evaluated short-term and long-term neurobehavior in mice after SAH. p97 was found to be significantly downregulated in the cerebral cortex of the affected side in mice after SAH. The site showing reduced p97 expression also exhibited a high level of neuronal apoptosis. Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of p97 significantly reduced the extent of neuronal apoptosis, improved early and long-term neurological function, and repaired the neuronal damage in the long term. These neuroprotective effects were accompanied by enhanced proteasome function and inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) apoptotic pathway involving eIF2\u03b1/CHOP. The administration of the p97 inhibitor NMS-873 induced a contradictory effect. Subsequently, we observed that inhibiting the function of the proteasome with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 blocked the anti-neuronal apoptosis effect of p97 and enhanced the activation of the ISR apoptotic pathway. However, the detrimental effects of NMS-873 and PS-341 in mice with SAH were mitigated by the administration of the ISR inhibitor ISRIB. These results suggest that p97 can promote neuronal survival and improve neurological function in mice after SAH. The anti-neuronal apoptosis effect of p97 is achieved by enhancing proteasome function and inhibiting the overactivation of the ISR apoptotic pathway.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "Early brain injury",

A total of 595 participants from the Taizhou Imaging Study, who underwent both gait and bone mineral density measurements, were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We used a wearable gait tracking device to collect quantitative gait parameters and then summarized them into independent gait domains with factor analysis. Bone mineral density was measured in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Magnetic resonance images were obtained on a 3.0-Tesla scanner, and the volumes of brain regions related to mobility were computed using FreeSurfer. Lower bone mineral density was found to be associated with higher gait variability, especially at the site of the lumbar spine (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.174, FDR\u2009=\u20090.001). Besides, higher gait variability was correlated with mobility-related brain atrophy, like the primary motor cortex (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.147, FDR\u2009=\u20090.006), sensorimotor cortex (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.153, FDR\u2009=\u20090.006), and entorhinal cortex (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.106, FDR\u2009=\u20090.043).

To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ArsR family transcriptional regulator governing cell death. We found that CdsR directly repressed lrgAB expression. Furthermore, lrgAB overexpression resulted in cell lysis without sporulation, akin to the cdsR mutant, suggesting that LrgAB, a holin-like protein, induces cell death in Bacillus spp. The lrgAB mutation increases abnormal cell numbers during spore development.

Herein, under guidance of theoretical calculations, hierarchical porous quasi-hexagonal Co2P nanosheets/Co heterostructures supported on carbon cloth (Co2P/Co/CC) with a high surface area were rationally designed and elaborately constructed through electroless Co plating, electrochemical oxidation, and phosphidation process, which showed significant electrocatalytic performance toward water electrolysis. Specifically, theoretical calculations revealed that the Co2P/Co heterostructure adjusted the electronic structure of Co2P and Co, reducing the energy barrier for target reactions and thereby boosting electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the typical Co2P/Co/CC catalyst demonstrated impressive HER performance, with low overpotentials of only 52 and 48\u00a0mV to achieve a current density of 10\u00a0mA/cm2 in 0.5\u00a0M H2SO4 and 1.0\u00a0M KOH solutions, respectively. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst can be attributed to the improved intrinsic activity resulting from the Co2P/Co heterostructures and the highly exposed active sites provided by the hierarchical porous structures. Furthermore, the Co2P/Co/CC catalyst exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline electrolyte, requiring a low overpotential of only 306\u00a0mV to achieve a current density of 100\u00a0mA/cm2. Additionally, a two-electrode electrolyzer assembled with the Co2P/Co/CC electrodes achieved a current density of 10\u00a0mA/cm2 at a low cell voltage of 1.54\u00a0V and demonstrated excellent long-term stability. This work presents a novel and feasible strategy for constructing hierarchical heterostructured electrocatalysts that enable efficient water electrolysis. By combining rational design and theoretical guidance, our approach offers promising prospects for advancing the field of electrocatalysis and facilitating sustainable energy conversion.", "Keywords": ["Bifunctional electrocatalyst", "Co(2)P/Co heterostructures", "Cobalt phosphide", "Porous quasi-hexagonal nanosheets", "Water splitting"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cun", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Fengyun", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Aojie", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Linsen", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenwen", "Last Name": "Yong", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinguang", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, 621908, Sichuan, China.

Herein, we present a new rare-earth porphyrinic metal-organic framework (RE-PMOF), BUT-233, which is a three-dimensional (3D) framework structure with the flu topology consisting of 4-connected BBCPPP-Ph ligands H4BBCPPP-Ph = 5',5\u2057-(10,20-diphenylporphyrin-5,15-diyl)bis([1,1':3',1\u2033-terphenyl]-4,4'' dicarboxylic acid) and 8-connected Eu6 clusters. Noteworthily, the porphyrin cores of the BBCPPP-Ph ligands in BUT-233 are nonplanar with a ruffle-like conformation. In contrast, the porphyrin core in the free ligand H4BBCPPP-Ph is in a nearly ideally planar conformation, as confirmed by its single-crystal structure. BUT-233 is microporous with 6-8 \u00c5 pores and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 649 m2/g, as well as high stability in common solvents. The MOF was used as a photocatalyst for the oxidation degradation of a chemical warfare agent model molecule CEES (CEES = 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide) under the light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation and an O2 atmosphere at room temperature. CEES was almost completely converted into its nontoxic light-oxidized product CEESO (CEESO = 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) in only 5 min with t1/2 = 2 min (t1/2: half-life). Moreover, the toxic deep-oxidized product 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfone (CEESO2) was not detected. The catalytic activity of BUT-233 was high in comparison with those of some previously reported MOF catalysts. The results of photo/electrochemical property studies suggested that the high catalytic activity of BUT-233 was benefited from the presence of nonplanar porphyrin rings on its pore surface.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Green Catalysis and Separation, Department of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, P.

The results demonstrate that the SAAs with strong host-guest metal interactions exhibit a preference for N\u2500O bond cleavage, and the reaction energy barrier of the hydrogenation process is primarily influenced by the host metal. Among them, Ir1Ni SAA stands out as the prime catalyst candidate, showcasing exceptional activity and selectivity. Furthermore, the Ir1Ni SAA is subsequently prepared through precise synthesis techniques and evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of 4-NS to 4-aminostyrene (4-AS). As anticipated, the Ir1Ni SAA demonstrates extraordinary catalytic performance (yield\u00a0>\u00a096%). In situ FT-IR experiments and DFT calculations further confirmed that the unique host-guest metal interaction at the Ir-Ni interface site of Ir1Ni SAA endows it with excellent 4-NS selective hydrogenation ability.

Interferons (IFNs) participate in a frontline antiviral defense mechanism triggering the activation of numerous downstream antiviral genes. Here, we demonstrated that TRIM25 overexpression significantly inhibited SADS-CoV replication, whereas TRIM25 deficiency markedly increased viral yield. We found that SADS-CoV N protein suppressed interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2) production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or poly(I:C). Moreover, we determined that SADS-CoV N protein interacted with RIG-I N-terminal two caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARDs) and TRIM25 coiled-coil dimerization (CCD) domain. The interaction of SADS-CoV N protein with RIG-I and TRIM25 caused TRIM25 multimerization inhibition, the RIG-I-TRIM25 interaction disruption, and consequent the IRF3 and TBK1 phosphorylation impediment. Overexpression of SADS-CoV N protein facilitated the replication of VSV-GFP by suppressing IFN-\u03b2 production.

For validation purposes, 2 pathologists reviewed OOIs from 32,451 cases of ThinPrep Paps independently, and their interpretations were correlated with the original ThinPrep interpretations (OTPI). The analysis was focused on the comparison of reporting rates, correlation between cytological results and histologic follow-up findings, and the assessment of independent AICyte screening utility. Pathologists using the AICyte system had a mean reading time of 55.14 seconds for the first 3000 cases trending down to 12.90 seconds in the last 6000 cases. Overall average reading time was 22.23 seconds per case compared with a manual reading time approximation of 180 seconds. Usage of AICyte compared with OTPI had similar sensitivity (97.89% vs 97.89%) and a statistically significant increase in specificity (16.19% vs 6.77%) for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplsia 2 and above lesions. When AICyte was run alone at a 50% negative cutoff value, it was able to read slides with a sensitivity of 99.30% and a specificity of 9.87%. When AICyte was run independently at this cutoff value, no sole case of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions/squamous cell carcinoma squamous lesion was missed. AICyte can provide a potential tool to help pathologists in both diagnostic capability and efficiency, which remained reliable compared with the baseline standard. Also unique for AICyte is the development of a negative cutoff value for which AICyte can categorize cases as \"not needed for review\" to triage cases and lower pathologist workload. This is the largest case number study that pathologists reviewed OOI with an AI-assistive system. The study demonstrates that AI-assistive system can be broadly applied for cervical cancer screening.", "Keywords": ["AICyte", "ThinPrep", "artificial intelligence", "cervical cancer", "screening"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Artificial Intelligence", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaginal Smears", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Papanicolaou Test", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Reproducibility of Results", "Uterine Cervical Dysplasia", "Cytology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinru", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Starr", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Magee-Womens Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiangchen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Ruiqian Technologies Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongzhen", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yixuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaotian", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Changzhong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Ruiqian Technologies Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Megan L", "Last Name": "Zilla", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Magee-Womens Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xianxu", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Zhengzhou Key Laboratory of Gynecological Disease's Early Diagnosis, Zhengzhou, China.

Iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein IscA1 (or MagR) is found within the mitochondria of most eukaryotes. Magnetoreceptor (MagR) is a highly conserved A-type iron and iron-sulfur cluster-binding protein, characterized by two distinct types of iron-sulfur clusters, [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S], each conferring unique magnetic properties. MagR forms a rod-like polymer structure in complex with photoreceptive cryptochrome (Cry) and serves as a putative magnetoreceptor for retrieving geomagnetic information in animal navigation. Although the N-terminal sequences of MagR vary among species, their specific function remains unknown. In the present study, we found that the N-terminal sequences of pigeon MagR, previously thought to serve as a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), were not cleaved following mitochondrial entry but instead modulated the efficiency with which iron-sulfur clusters and irons are bound. Moreover, the N-terminal region of MagR was required for the formation of a stable MagR/Cry complex. Thus, the N-terminal sequences in pigeon MagR fulfil more important functional roles than just mitochondrial targeting.

HOIP domain interactome characterizes a set of previously undefined linear ubiquitinated substrates and elucidates the cross-talk among HOIP domains in physiological and pathological processes.

Meanwhile, Hoip deficiency decreases the linear ubiquitination of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) and enhances its E3 activity, finally causing a reduced bone mass phenotype in mice.

The results showed that the void fractions of landfill directly affected the gas flow path. When the landfill void fraction was small (e.g., NS), most airflow traveled directly through the pipeline and minimal airflow entered the waste layer. When the landfill void fraction was large (e.g., MS), air easily entered the waste layer and some air flowed into the gas vent with the landfill gas. As the reaction proceeded, the void fraction gradually decreased due to gravity-induced sedimentation. During the water addition experiment, the voids were occupied by water, leading to formation of an anaerobic area. Among the four bioreactors, only MS had negligible formation of an anaerobic zone in the center. Methane (CH4) generation was detected only at the connection between the gas vent and the leachate collection pipe. A larger void fraction led to formation of a smaller anaerobic zone.

Methods: For the primary analysis, 249 metabolic biomarkers were obtained from the UK Biobank, and 123 circulating metabolites were obtained from the publication by Kuttunen et al. for the secondary analysis. Chalazion summary data were obtained from the FinnGen database. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) is the main MR analysis method, and the MR assumptions were evaluated in sensitivity and colocalization analyses. Results: Two MR analyses results showed that the common metabolite, alanine, exhibited a genetic protective effect against chalazion (primary analysis: odds ratio [OR] = 0.680; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.507-0.912; p = 0.010; secondary analysis: OR = 0.578; 95% CI, 0.439-0.759; p = 0.00008).

Plastic has become an indispensable material in various industries and daily use scenarios, yet the VOC emissions and associated health risks in the plastic manufacturing industry have received limited attention. In this study, we conducted sampling in three typical plastic manufacturing factories to analyze the emission characteristics of VOCs, ozone formation potential (OFP), and health risks for workers. Isopropanol was detected at relatively high concentrations in all three factories, with concentrations in organized emissions reaching 322.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, 344.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, and 22.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, respectively. Alkanes are the most emitted category of VOCs in plastic factories. However, alkenes and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) exhibit higher OFP. In organized emissions of different types of VOCs in the three factories, alkenes and OVOCs contributed 22.8%, 67%, and 37.8% to the OFP, respectively, highlighting the necessity of controlling them. The hazard index (HI) for all three factories was less than 1, indicating a low non-carcinogenic toxic risk; however, there is still a possibility of non-cancerous health risks in two of the factories, and a potential lifetime cancer risk in all of the three factories. For workers with job tenures exceeding 5 years, there may be potential health risks, hence wearing masks with protective capabilities is necessary. This study provides evidence for reducing VOC emissions and improving management measures to ensure the health protection of workers in the plastic manufacturing industry.", "Keywords": ["Hazard index", "Lifetime cancer risk", "Ozone formation potential", "Plastic manufacturing", "VOC emissions"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Air Pollutants", "Volatile Organic Compounds", "Environmental Monitoring", "Risk Assessment", "Ozone", "Manufacturing Industry", "Alkenes", "China"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuchao", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Big Data Research Center for Ecology and Environment, Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Guan", "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Land and Sea Ecological Governance and Systematic Regulation, Shandong Academy for Environmental Planning, Jinan 250101, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yanbo", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Big Data Research Center for Ecology and Environment, Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, PR China; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Land and Sea Ecological Governance and Systematic Regulation, Shandong Academy for Environmental Planning, Jinan 250101, PR China.

Abnormal fluctuations in HClO concentration can lead to various diseases, such as inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, developing an approach to rapidly and sensitively quantify ClO- content is vital to biomedicine development and bioassays. Herein, we fabricated a novel \"turn-on\" label-free fluorescence DNA probe to specifically detect hypochlorite ion (ClO-) based on G-quadruplex formation. To this end, we designed a G-rich signal DNA sequence (S-DNA) and a block DNA sequence (B-DNA), followed by the introduction of ClO--responsive phosphorothioate (PS) into B-DNA. In the absence of ClO-, B-DNA hybridized with S-DNA, preventing G-quadruplex formation from S-DNA; this resulted in the relatively low fluorescence intensity of ThT. Once ClO- was added, the hydrolysis between PS and ClO- split the B-DNA into two fragments, resulting in B-DNA breaking away from S-DNA, allowing G-quadruplex formation from S-DNA and increasing the fluorescence intensity of ThT. Using this method, we can detect ClO- without the interference of additional reactive oxygen species. The detection limit of ClO- was as low as 10\u00a0nM. Furthermore, this method facilitates the detection of ClO- within the tissues of rats with stress-induced hypertension.", "Keywords": ["ClO(\u2212)", "G-quadruplex", "Phosphorothioate", "Stress-induced hypertension", "Thioflavin T"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "DNA, B-Form", "Fluorescent Dyes", "DNA", "G-Quadruplexes", "Biosensing Techniques", "Hypochlorous Acid", "Hypertension", "Benzothiazoles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haisheng", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Bioengineering, Heze University, Shandong, Heze 274000, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Bioengineering, Heze University, Shandong, Heze 274000, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiangrong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Shandong Provincial Hospital Group Heze Hospital, Shandong, Heze 274000, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongsong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Bioengineering, Heze University, Shandong, Heze 274000, China."}, {"First Name": "Yiwei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Bioengineering, Heze University, Shandong, Heze 274000, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Bioengineering, Heze University, Shandong, Heze 274000, China.

Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), a pivotal rate-limiting enzyme in L-serine biosynthesis, has been documented to instigate the insulin signaling pathway through dephosphorylation. Concomitantly, CD38, acting as a mediator in mitochondrial transfer, is activated by the insulin pathway. Given that we have demonstrated the beneficial effects of exogenous mitochondrial supplementation on DACD, we further hypothesized whether astrocytic PSPH could contribute to improving DACD by promoting astrocytic mitochondrial transfer into neurons. In the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, our results demonstrated that overexpression of PSPH in astrocytes alleviated DACD in db/db mice. Astrocyte specific-stimulated by PSPH lentivirus/ adenovirus promoted the spine density both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, astrocytic PSPH amplified the expression of CD38 via initiation of the insulin signaling pathway, thereby promoting astrocytic mitochondria transfer into neurons. In summation, this comprehensive study delineated the pivotal role of astrocytic PSPH in alleviating DACD and expounded upon its intricate cellular mechanism involving mitochondrial transfer.

We previously found that a strong promoter of a DeoR family transcriptional regulator (HD73_5014) can efficiently drive cry1Ac expression in B. thuringiensis HD73. Here, we investigated the regulation of neighbor genes by HD73_5014. The HD73_5014 homologs are widely distributed in Gram-positive bacterial species. Its neighbor genes include pepV, rsuA, and ytgP, which encode dipeptidase, rRNA pseudouridine synthase and polysaccharide biosynthesis protein, respectively. The four open reading frames (ORFs) are organized to be a pepR gene cluster in HD73. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the rsuA and ytgP genes formed a transcriptional unit (rsuA-ytgP operon), while pepV formed a transcriptional unit in HD73. Promoter-lacZ fusion assays showed that the pepV and rsuA-ytgP promoters are regulated by HD73_5014. EMSA experiments showed that HD73_5014 directly binds to the pepV promoter region but not to the rusA-ytgP promoter region. Thus, the HD73_5014 transcriptional regulator, which controls the expression of the dipeptidase pepV, was named PepR (dipeptidase regulator).

Here, we report that activation of the tumor-intrinsic Hippo pathway positively correlates with the expression of MHC class I APP genes and the abundance of CD8+ CTLs in mouse tumors and patients. Blocking the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein/transcriptional enhanced associate domain (YAP/TEAD) potently improves antitumor immunity.

In this study, by using IgG4-RD patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells\u00a0(PBMCs), IgG4-RD cell lines and Usp25 knockout mice, we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) engages in multiple pathways to regulate fibrotic and inflammatory pathways that are characteristic to IgG4-RD. Reduced USP25 expression in IgG4-RD leads to increased SMAD3 activation, which contributes to fibrosis and induces inflammation through the IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory axis. Mechanistically, USP25 prevents ubiquitination of RAC1, thus, downregulation of USP25 leads to ubiquitination and degradation of RAC1. Decreased RAC1 levels result in reduced aldolase A release from the actin cytoskeleton, which then lowers glycolysis. The expression of LYN, a component of the B cell receptor signalosome is also reduced in USP25-deficient B cells, which might result in B cell activation deficiency.

Organic matter in ambient PM2.5 samples were characterized at molecular level using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector and an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Although the molecular composition of organic aerosols varied substantially over different ambient environments, they were mainly composed by CHO and CHON species in positive ionization mode while CHO and CHOS species in negative mode. The mass absorption coefficients of BrC aerosols at wavelength range 250-450\u00a0nm were relatively higher for winter samples in both cities and for Shijiazhuang samples in both seasons, partly attributed to the higher concentration levels of anthropogenic air pollutants in these environments. The absorption \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponents further revealed that BrC aerosols in winter seasons and in Shijiazhuang had a greater capacity of absorption at shorter wavelengths. A total of 26 BrC species with strong absorption were unambiguously identified from different environments, which mainly consisted of CHO, CHON, and CHN species and had higher degrees of unsaturation and lower degrees of oxidation.

However, applying BCI in clinical practice is still a challenge due to the great diversity of patients. In the current study, a novel action observation (AO) based BCI was proposed and tested on stroke patients. Ten non-hemineglect patients and ten hemineglect patients were recruited. Four AO stimuli were designed, each presenting a decomposed action to complete the reach-and-grasp task. EEG data and eye movement data were collected. Eye movement data was utilized to analyze the reasons for individual differences in BCI performance. Task discriminative component analysis was utilized to perform online target detection. The results showed that the designed AO-based BCI could simultaneously induce steady state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) from the occipital region and sensory motor rhythm from the sensorimotor region in stroke patients. The average online detection accuracy among the four AO stimuli reached 67% within 3 s in the non-hemineglect group, while the accuracy only reached 35% in the hemineglect group. Gaze metrics showed that the average total duration of fixations during the stimulus phase in the hemineglect group was only 1.31 s \u00b1 0.532 s which was significantly lower than that in the non-hemineglect group. The results indicated that hemineglect patients have difficulty gazing at the AO stimulus, resulting in poor detection performance and weak desynchronization in the sensorimotor region. Furthermore, the degree of neglect is inversely proportional to the target detection accuracy in hemineglect stroke patients. In addition, the gaze metrics associated with cognitive load were significantly correlated with the accuracy in non-hemineglect patients. It indicated the cognitive load may affect the AO-based BCI.

demonstrated that the microstructure of copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuSNPs) can be controlled to enhance mechanical and photothermal conversion properties of chitosan (CS)/CuSNPs hybrid fibers. However, achieving optimal dispersion and compatibility of CuSNPs within a CS matrix remains a challenge, this study aims to improve dispersion and compatibility by modifying the CuSNPs' interface, thereby enhancing mechanical and photothermal conversion properties of hybrid fibers. The interfaces of @CuSNPs (CuS@Xylan NPs, CuS@SA NPs, and CuS@PEG NPs) contain hydroxyl groups, facilitating the hydrogen bonds formation with the CS matrix. The dispersibility is further enhanced by the synergistic effect of xylan and SA's anionic charges with cationic chitosan. Notably, the viscosity of the CS/@CuSNPs hybrid spinning solution is significantly enhanced, resulting in improved breaking strength for initial hybrid fibers. Specifically, the breaking strength of CS/CuS@Xylan NPs hybrid fibers reaches 1.4 cN/dtex, exhibiting a 42.86\u00a0% and 20.6\u00a0% increase over CS and CS/CuSNPs hybrid fibers. Simultaneously, the CS/CuS@Xylan NPs hybrid fibers exhibit exceptional photothermal conversion performance, surpassing that of CS fibers by 5.2 times and CS/CuSNPs hybrid fibers by 1.4 times. The regulation of interface modification is an efficient approach to enhance the tensile strength and photothermal conversion properties of CS/CuSNPs hybrid fibers.", "Keywords": ["Chitosan", "CuS nanoparticles", "Photothermal performance"], "MeSH terms": ["Chitosan", "Xylans", "Nanoparticles", "Copper", "Sulfides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhihao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Da", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shangyin", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dongliang", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Huirong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Linna", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Bio-Fibers and Eco-textiles, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Bio-Fibers and Eco-textiles, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Sen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Textile and Materials Engineering, Dalian Polytechnic University, #1 Qinggongyuan, Ganjingzi, Dalian 116034, Liaoning, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Bio-Fibers and Eco-textiles, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, PR China.

However, the study of the growth process of highly active borohydrides remains challenging. Herein, for the first time the synthesis of LiBH4 nanorods through a hydrogen-assisted one-pot solvothermal reaction is reported. Reaction of n-butyl lithium with triethylamine borane in n-hexane under 50\u00a0bar of H2 at 40-100\u00a0\u00b0C gives rise to the formation of the [100]-oriented LiBH4 nanorods with 500-800\u00a0nm in diameter, whose growth is driven by orientated attachment and ligand adsorption. The unique morphology enables the LiBH4 nanorods to release hydrogen from \u2248184\u00a0\u00b0C, 94\u00a0\u00b0C lower than the commercial sample (\u2248278\u00a0\u00b0C). Hydrogen release amounts to 13\u00a0wt% within 40\u00a0min at 450\u00a0\u00b0C with a stable cyclability, remarkably superior to the commercial LiBH4 (\u22489.1\u00a0wt%). More importantly, up to 180\u00a0\u00b0C reduction in the onset temperature of hydrogenation is successfully attained by the nanorod sample with respect to the commercial counterpart. The LiBH4 nanorods show no foaming during dehydrogenation, which improves the hydrogen cycling performance.

Two critical strategies to address this issue are high-quality crystallization and passivation of GBs. However, the established methods are generally carried out discretely due to the complicated mechanisms of grain growth and defect formation. In this study, a combined method is proposed by introducing 3,4,5-Trifluoroaniline iodide (TFAI) into the perovskite precursor. The TFAI triggers the union of nano-sized colloids into microclusters and facilitates the complete phase transition of \u03b1-FAPbI3 at room temperature. The controlled chemical reactivity and strong steric hindrance effect enable the fixed location of TFAI and suppress defects at GBs. This combination of well-crystallized perovskite grains and effectively passivated GBs leads to an improvement in the open circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs from 1.08\u00a0V to 1.17\u00a0V, which is one of the highest recorded Voc without interface modification.

A two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) film is a newly developed effective anticorrosion material due to its superior impermeability, thermal stability, and chemical stability. However, research in growth and anticorrosion properties of large-area dense h-BN coating films still lies in its infancy. Here, we report on the synthesis of a large-area and continuous dense few-layer (\u223c4) h-BN coating film onto a metal surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and its anticorrosion properties both in air and seawater environments. Cu coated in h-BN, which functions as an anticorrosive coating, exhibits an impressively reduced corrosion rate (CR) in a 3.5% NaCl solution (which mimics a seawater environment) when compared to bare Cu (approximately 27 times). At 200 \u00b0C, the h-BN coating can prevent Cu foil's surface from oxidizing, although doing so will cause a significant amount of oxide particles to simultaneously form on the bare Cu surface. In the meantime, the performance of the h-BN film remains unaltered after 100 days in an atmospheric environment, demonstrating the ultrahigh stability and corrosion resistance of the as-grown h-BN film.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuqing", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Junlei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongying", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Mansoor", "Last Name": "Khalid", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Haiying", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "PingAn", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China."}], "Journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "PubDate": "2024Apr02"}, {"PMID": "38504151", "Title": "Chromosome-level genome assembly provides insights into the genome evolution and functional importance of the phenylpropanoid-flavonoid pathway in Thymus mongolicus.", "Abstract": "Thymus mongolicus (family Lamiaceae) is a Thyme subshrub with strong aroma and remarkable environmental adaptability.

Mitochondrial transfer RNASer (UCN) gene is another hot spot for mutations associated with non-syndromic hearing loss, besides the 12S ribosomal RNA gene. In this study, we assessed the clinical phenotype and the molecular characteristics of two Chinese families with non-syndromic hearing loss. Mutational analysis revealed that 7445A\u00a0>\u00a0G and 7510T\u00a0>\u00a0C mutations in the mitochondrial transfer RNASer (UCN) gene were the molecular etiology of Family 1 and Family 2, respectively. However, the clinical and genetic characteristics of the two families carrying the above mutations in the transfer RNASer (UCN) gene exhibited a variable expression of hearing loss and an incomplete penetrance. Sequencing analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome showed the presence of transfer RNATrp 5568A\u00a0>\u00a0G and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 11696G\u00a0>\u00a0A mutations in Family 1.

However, the ferroptosis with orthodontic tooth movement(OTM) relationship has not been thoroughly described. We here analysed whether ferroptosis is involved in OTM-associated alveolar bone loss. Mouse osteoblasts (MC-3T3) and knockdown glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) MC-3T3 were stimulated with compressive force loading and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor), and the changes in lipid peroxidation morphology, expression of ferroptosis-related factors and osteogenesis levels were detected. After establishing the rat experimental OTM model, the changes in ferroptosis-related factors and osteogenesis levels were reevaluated in the same manner. Ferroptosis was involved in mechanical stress regulating osteoblast remodelling, and Fer-1 and erastin affected osteoblasts under compression force loading. Fer-1 regulated ferroptosis and autophagy in MC-3T3 and promoted bone proliferation. GPX4-dependent ferroptosis stimulated the YAP (homologous oncoproteins Yes-associated protein) pathway, and GPX4 promoted ferroptosis via the YAP-TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain) signal pathway under mechanical compression force. The in\u00a0vivo experiment results were consistent with the in\u00a0vitro experiment results. Ferroptosis transpires during the motion of orthodontic teeth, with compression force side occurring earlier than stretch side within 4\u2009h. GPX4 plays an important role in alveolar bone loss, while Fer-1 can inhibit the compression force-side alveolar bone loss. GPX4's Hippo-YAP pathway is activated by the lack of compression force in the lateral alveolar bone.", "Keywords": ["ferroptosis", "gpx4", "mechanical force", "osteoblasts"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Rats", "Animals", "Osteogenesis", "Alveolar Bone Loss", "Stress, Mechanical", "Ferroptosis", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wang", "Last Name": "Mengjia", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Research Center of Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Jinan, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, Nanjing Stomatological Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Research Institute of Stomatology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Xin", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Research Center of Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Jinan, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Jiahao", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Research Center of Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Jinan, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Guo", "Last Name": "Jie", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Research Center of Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Jinan, Shandong, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38492599", "Title": "Sulfur enhances iron plaque formation and stress resistance to reduce the transfer of Cd and As in the soil-rice system.", "Abstract": "Sulfur plays an essential role in agricultural production, but few studies have been reported on how sulfur simultaneously impacts the transformation of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) in the soil-rice system. This research selected two soils co-contaminated with both Cd and As, varying in acidity and alkalinity levels, to study the impacts of elemental sulfur (S) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) on the migration and accumulation of Cd and As by rice. Results indicated that two types of sulfur had a substantial (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) impact on decreasing the contents of Cd (28.3-50.4\u00a0%) and As (20.1-38.6\u00a0%) in brown rice in acidic and alkaline soils.

Notably, sulfur augmented the generation of iron plaque on rice root surfaces, which increased the fixation of Cd (17.6-61.0\u00a0%) and As (14.0-45.9\u00a0%). SEM-EDS results also indicated that the rice root surface exhibited significant enrichment of Fe, Cd, and As. The mechanism of simultaneous Cd and As immobilization by sulfur application was mainly ascribed to the contribution of iron plaque. Additionally, sulfur reduced the contents of Cd and As in soil porewater and promoted the transformation of As(III) to As(V) to reduce the toxicity of As. The K-edge XAFS of As in iron plaque also confirmed that sulfur application significantly promoted As(III) oxidation.

The results reveal that the dynamic processes of Fe(II) oxidation play a crucial role in regulating HMs migration during both FeS oxygenation and sediment aeration in the absence of zeolite. Based on the release of HMs, Fe(II) oxidation can be delineated into two stages: stage I, where HMs (Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+) are released from minerals or sediments into suspension, and stage II, released HMs are partially re-sequestered back to mineral phases or sediments due to the generation of Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide. In contrast, the addition of zeolite inhibits the increase of HMs concentration in suspension during stage I. Subsequently, the redistribution of HMs between zeolite and the newly formed Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide occurs during stage II. This redistribution of HMs generates new sorption sites in zeolite, making them available for resorbing a new load of HMs. The outcomes of this study provide potential solutions for sequestering HMs during the sediment aeration.", "Keywords": ["Fe(II) oxidation", "HMs", "Redistribution", "Sediment aeration", "Zeolite"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"First Name": "Deb P", "Last Name": "Jaisi", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Chang Jiang Water Resources Protection Institute, Wuhan 430051, China."}, {"First Name": "Fengling", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Chang Jiang Water Resources Protection Institute, Wuhan 430051, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Soil Health and Green Remediation, College of Resources and Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaxuan", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Soil Health and Green Remediation, College of Resources and Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}, {"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.
