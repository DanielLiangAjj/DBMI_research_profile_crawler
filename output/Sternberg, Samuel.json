Here we report deep evolutionary links between bacterial IS110 transposases, which catalyze RNA-guided DNA recombination using bridge RNAs, and archaeal/eukaryotic Nop5-family proteins, which promote RNA-guided RNA 2'-O-methylation using C/D-box snoRNAs. Based on conservation in the protein primary sequence, domain architecture, and three-dimensional structure, as well as common architectural features of the non-coding RNA components, we propose that programmable RNA modification emerged via exaptation of components derived from IS110-like transposons.

Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (neo) whose translation causes potent growth arrest. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of diverse DRT2 homologs further revealed broad conservation of rolling-circle reverse transcription and Neo protein function.

IS605family TnpB homologs function in bacteria as programmable homing endonucleases by exploiting transposon-encoded guide RNAs to cleave vacant genomic sites, thereby driving transposon maintenance through DSB-stimulated homologous recombination. Whether this pathway is conserved in other genetic contexts, and in association with other transposases, is unknown. Here we uncover molecular mechanisms of transposition and RNA-guided DNA cleavage by IS607-family elements that, remarkably, also encode catalytic, self-splicing group I introns.

Strikingly, intron splicing was strongly repressed not only by TnpB, but also by the secondary structure of \u03c9RNA alone, allowing the element to carefully control the relative levels of spliced products versus functional guide RNAs. Our results suggest that IStron transcripts have evolved a sensitive equilibrium to balance competing and mutually exclusive activities that promote transposon maintenance while limiting adverse fitness costs on the host.

Despite this targeting diversity, transposition invariably requires TnsB, a DDE-family transposase that catalyses DNA excision and insertion, and TnsC, a AAA+ ATPase that is thought to communicate between transposase and targeting proteins4. How TnsC mediates this communication and thereby regulates transposition fidelity has remained unclear. Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing to monitor in vivo formation of the type I-F RNA-guided transpososome, enabling us to resolve distinct protein recruitment events before integration. DNA targeting by the TniQ-Cascade complex is surprisingly promiscuous-hundreds of genomic off-target sites are sampled, but only a subset of those sites is licensed for TnsC and TnsB recruitment, revealing a crucial proofreading checkpoint. To advance the mechanistic understanding of interactions responsible for transpososome assembly, we determined structures of TnsC using cryogenic electron microscopy and found that ATP binding drives the formation of heptameric rings that thread DNA through the central pore, thereby positioning the substrate for downstream integration.

To investigate the molecular determinants and relevance of the interlobe rearrangement for target recognition and cleavage, we designed a split-Cas9 enzyme in which the nuclease lobe and \u03b1-helical lobe are expressed as separate polypeptides. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage.

In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site in dsDNA. Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms, but it has been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA. Here we show that Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage. Using specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA sequences, and we demonstrate that this strategy enables the isolation of a specific endogenous messenger RNA from cells.

The Cascade complex then recruits Cas3, a nuclease-helicase that catalyzes unwinding and cleavage of foreign double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bearing a sequence matching that of the crRNA. Cascade comprises the CasA-E proteins and one crRNA, forming a structure that binds and unwinds dsDNA to form an R loop in which the target strand of the DNA base pairs with the 32-nt RNA guide sequence. Single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions of dsDNA-bound Cascade with and without Cas3 reveal that Cascade positions the PAM-proximal end of the DNA duplex at the CasA subunit and near the site of Cas3 association. The finding that the DNA target and Cas3 colocalize with CasA implicates this subunit in a key target-validation step during DNA interference. We show biochemically that base pairing of the PAM region is unnecessary for target binding but critical for Cas3-mediated degradation. In addition, the L1 loop of CasA, previously implicated in PAM recognition, is essential for Cas3 activation following target binding by Cascade. Together, these data show that the CasA subunit of Cascade functions as an essential partner of Cas3 by recognizing DNA target sites and positioning Cas3 adjacent to the PAM to ensure cleavage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Base Sequence", "Binding Sites", "CRISPR-Associated Proteins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "DNA Helicases", "Escherichia coli K12", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Macromolecular Substances", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Subunits", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Bacterial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan L", "Last Name": "Hochstrasser", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, and Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Prashant", "Last Name": "Bhat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chantal K", "Last Name": "Guegler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel H", "Last Name": "Sternberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Nogales", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer A", "Last Name": "Doudna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014May06"}, {"PMID": "24505130", "Title": "Structures of Cas9 endonucleases reveal RNA-mediated conformational activation.", "Abstract": "Type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems use an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9, to generate double-strand breaks in invasive DNA during an adaptive bacterial immune response.
