With orders-of-magnitude improvements in volumetric efficiency over other BCI technologies, we developed a 50-\u03bcm-thick, mechanically flexible micro-electrocorticography (\u03bcECoG) BCI, integrating 256\u00d7256 electrodes, signal processing, data telemetry, and wireless powering on a single complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrate containing 65,536 recording and 16,384 stimulation channels, from which we can simultaneously record up to 1024 channels at a given time. Fully implanted below the dura, our chip is wirelessly powered, communicating bi-directionally with an external relay station outside the body. We demonstrated chronic, reliable recordings for up to two weeks in pigs and up to two months in behaving non-human primates from somatosensory, motor, and visual cortices, decoding brain signals at high spatiotemporal resolution.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taesung", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nanyu", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Fabbri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Eichler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Konstantin", "Last Name": "Willeke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katie E", "Last Name": "Wingel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Agrita", "Last Name": "Dubey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rizwan", "Last Name": "Huq", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohit", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Girish", "Last Name": "Ramakrishnan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Tien", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Mantovani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abhinav", "Last Name": "Parihar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Heyu", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Denise", "Last Name": "Oswalt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Misdorp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ilke", "Last Name": "Uguz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tori", "Last Name": "Shinn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabrielle J", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cate", "Last Name": "Nealley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Gonzales", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Roukes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Knecht", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Yoshor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eleonora", "Last Name": "Spinazzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luca P", "Last Name": "Carloni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bijan", "Last Name": "Pesaran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saumil", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brett", "Last Name": "Youngerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R James", "Last Name": "Cotton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Tolias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth L", "Last Name": "Shepard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38557864", "Title": "Use of Recommended Neurodiagnostic Evaluation Among Patients With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.", "Abstract": "Interdisciplinary practice parameters recommend that patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) undergo comprehensive neurodiagnostic evaluation, including presurgical assessment.

This complex mixture of cell types forms the biological context for therapeutic response and tumor recurrence.

These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival. Treating acute slices of GBM with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor depleted the transcriptional signature of this pernicious tissue-state.

Subdural strip and grid electrode (SDE) implantations have long been used as the mainstay of intracranial seizure localization in the United States. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an alternative approach in which depth electrodes are placed through percutaneous drill holes to stereotactically defined coordinates in the brain. Long used in certain centers in Europe, SEEG is gaining wider popularity in North America, bolstered by the advent of stereotactic robotic assistance and mounting evidence of safety, without the need for catheter-based angiography. Rates of clinically significant hemorrhage, infection, and other complications appear lower with SEEG than with SDE implants. SEEG also avoids unnecessary craniotomies when seizures are localized to unresectable eloquent cortex, found to be multifocal or nonfocal, or ultimately treated with stereotactic procedures such as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), or deep brain stimulation (DBS). While SDE allows for excellent localization and functional mapping on the cortical surface, SEEG offers a less invasive option for sampling disparate brain areas, bilateral investigations, and deep or medial targets. SEEG has shown efficacy for seizure localization in the temporal lobe, the insula, lesional and nonlesional extra-temporal epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartomas, periventricular nodular heterotopias, and patients who have had prior craniotomies for resections or grids.

A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients.

Despite growing enthusiasm, the patterns and implications of this rapid adoption are largely unknown. National trends in DBS surgery performed for all indications between 2002 and 2011 are reported. METHODS Using a national database of hospital discharges, admissions for DBS for 14 indications were identified and categorized as either FDA approved, humanitarian device exempt (HDE), or emerging. Trends over time were examined, differences were analyzed by univariate analyses, and outcomes were analyzed by hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2011, there were an estimated 30,490 discharges following DBS for approved indications, 1647 for HDE indications, and 2014 for emerging indications. The volume for HDE and emerging indications grew at 36.1% annually in comparison with 7.0% for approved indications. DBS for emerging indications occurred at hospitals with more neurosurgeons and neurologists locally, but not necessarily at those with the highest DBS caseloads. Patients treated for HDE and emerging indications were younger with lower comorbidity scores. HDE and emerging indications were associated with greater rates of reported complications, longer lengths of stay, and greater total costs. CONCLUSIONS DBS for HDE and emerging indications underwent rapid growth in the last decade, and it is not exclusively the most experienced DBS practitioners leading the charge to treat the newest indications.

Anecdotal reports have raised concerns regarding altered growth and alignment of the cervical spine after surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effects of these surgeries on the growth and alignment of the maturing spine. METHODS A multiinstitutional retrospective chart review was conducted for patients less than or equal to 6 years of age who underwent OC or AA fusion with rigid instrumentation at 9 participating centers. All patients had at least 3 years of clinical and radiographic follow-up data and radiographically confirmed fusion. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and most recent follow-up radiographs and/or CT scans were evaluated to assess changes in spinal growth and alignment. RESULTS Forty children (9 who underwent AA fusion and 31 who underwent OC fusion) were included in the study (mean follow-up duration 56 months). The mean vertical growth over the fused levels in the AA fusion patients represented 30% of the growth of the cervical spine (range 10%-50%). Three different vertical growth patterns of the fusion construct developed among the 31 OC fusion patients during the follow-up period: 1) 16 patients had substantial growth (13%-46% of the total growth of the cervical spine); 2) 9 patients had no meaningful growth; and 3) 6 patients, most of whom presented with a distracted atlantooccipital dislocation, had a decrease in the height of the fused levels (range 7-23 mm). Regarding spinal alignment, 85% (34/40) of the patients had good alignment at follow-up, with straight or mildly lordotic cervical curvatures. In 1 AA fusion patient (11%) and 5 OC fusion patients (16%), we observed new hyperlordosis (range 43\u00b0-62\u00b0). There were no cases of new kyphosis or swan-neck deformity, evidence of subaxial instability, or unintended subaxial fusion.

METHODS The authors included studies comparing objective clinical measures before and after cingulotomy or capsulotomy (surgical and radiosurgical) in patients with OCD. Only papers reporting the most current follow-up data for each group of investigators were included. Studies reporting results on patients undergoing one or more procedures other than cingulotomy or capsulotomy were excluded. Case reports and studies with a mean follow-up shorter than 12 months were excluded. Clinical response was defined in terms of a change in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score. The authors searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge through October 2013. English and non-English articles and abstracts were reviewed. RESULTS Ten studies involving 193 participants evaluated the length of follow-up, change in the Y-BOCS score, and postoperative adverse events (AEs) after cingulotomy (n = 2 studies, n = 81 participants) or capsulotomy (n = 8 studies, n = 112 participants). The average time to the last follow-up was 47 months for cingulotomy and 60 months for capsulotomy. The mean reduction in the Y-BOCS score at 12 months' follow-up was 37% for cingulotomy and 55% for capsulotomy. At the last follow-up, the mean reduction in Y-BOCS score was 37% for cingulotomy and 57% for capsulotomy. The average full response rate to cingulotomy at the last follow-up was 41% (range 38%-47%, n = 2 studies, n = 51 participants), and to capsulotomy was 54% (range 37%-80%, n = 5 studies, n = 50 participants). The rate of transient AEs was 14.3% across cingulotomy studies (n = 116 procedures) and 56.2% across capsulotomy studies (n = 112 procedures). The rate of serious or permanent AEs was 5.2% across cingulotomy studies and 21.4% across capsulotomy studies. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review of the literature supports the efficacy of both dorsal anterior cingulotomy and anterior capsulotomy in this highly treatment-refractory population. The observational nature of available data limits the ability to directly compare these procedures. Controlled or head-to-head studies are necessary to identify differences in efficacy or AEs and may lead to the individualization of treatment recommendations.", "Keywords": ["AE = adverse event", "AHRQ = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality", "CBTC = cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical", "DBS = deep brain stimulation", "LL = limbic leucotomy", "MeSH = Medical Subject Headings", "OCD = obsessive-compulsive disorder", "OFC = orbitofrontal cortex", "PRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses", "SCT = subcaudate tractotomy", "Y-BOCS = Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale", "capsulotomy", "cingulotomy", "dACC = dorsal anterior cingulate cortex", "functional neurosurgery", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "psychiatric neurosurgery", "stereotactic lesions"], "MeSH terms": ["Drug Resistance", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Internal Capsule", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Psychosurgery"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauren T", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University; and."}, {"First Name": "Charles B", "Last Name": "Mikell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University; and."}, {"First Name": "Brett E", "Last Name": "Youngerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University; and."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University; and."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University; and."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "26220691", "Title": "Mobile Phone-Connected Wearable Motion Sensors to Assess Postoperative Mobilization.", "Abstract": "Early mobilization after surgery reduces the incidence of a wide range of complications.

However, the occurrence of 'slow sinusoidal hemodynamic oscillations' (SSHOs) in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies is rarely noted or considered. As a result, little investigation into the cause of SSHOs has been undertaken, and their potential to confound fMRI analysis, as well as their possible value as a functional biomarker has been largely overlooked. Here, we report direct observation of large-amplitude, sinusoidal ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in the cortex of an awake human undergoing surgical resection of a brain tumor. Intraoperative multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) revealed that SSHOs were spatially localized to distinct regions of the cortex, exhibited wave-like propagation, and involved oscillations in the diameter of specific pial arterioles, indicating that the effect was not the result of systemic blood pressure oscillations. fMRI data collected from the same subject 4 days prior to surgery demonstrates that ~0.1 Hz oscillations in the BOLD signal can be detected around the same region. Intraoperative optical imaging data from a patient undergoing epilepsy surgery, in whom sinusoidal oscillations were not observed, is shown for comparison. This direct observation of the '0.1 Hz wave' in the awake human brain, using both intraoperative imaging and pre-operative fMRI, confirms that SSHOs occur in the human brain, and can be detected by fMRI. We discuss the possible physiological basis of this oscillation and its potential link to brain pathologies, highlighting its relevance to resting-state fMRI and its potential as a novel target for functional diagnosis and delineation of neurological disease.", "Keywords": ["0.1Hz oscillation", "Cerebral hemodynamics", "Intraoperative optical imaging", "Resting state", "Vasomotion", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Optical Imaging", "Wakefulness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aleksandr", "Last Name": "Rayshubskiy", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa J", "Last Name": "Wojtasiewicz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles B", "Last Name": "Mikell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Bouchard", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dmitriy", "Last Name": "Timerman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brett E", "Last Name": "Youngerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "McGovern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc L", "Last Name": "Otten", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M C", "Last Name": "Hillman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, USA; Department of Radiology, Columbia University, USA.

We recorded 49 neurons in the substantia nigra. Using an auditory oddball task, we showed that they fired more rapidly following novel sounds than repetitive tones.
