We launched the ICGC-TCGA (International Cancer Genome Consortium-The Cancer Genome Atlas) DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Tumor Heterogeneity and Evolution Challenge to benchmark existing subclonal reconstruction algorithms. This 7-year community effort used cloud computing to benchmark 31 subclonal reconstruction algorithms on 51 simulated tumors. Algorithms were scored on seven independent tasks, leading to 12,061 total runs. Algorithm choice influenced performance substantially more than tumor features but purity-adjusted read depth, copy-number state and read mappability were associated with the performance of most algorithms on most tasks. No single algorithm was a top performer for all seven tasks and existing ensemble strategies were unable to outperform the best individual methods, highlighting a key research need. All containerized methods, evaluation code and datasets are available to support further assessment of the determinants of subclonal reconstruction accuracy and development of improved methods to understand tumor evolution.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adriana", "Last Name": "Salcedo", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

They identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) secreted by adipocyte precursor cells as an activator of HER3 signaling that enables resistance. The NRG1-mediated FGFR inhibitor resistance was amenable to intervention with pertuzumab, an antibody blocking the NRG1/HER3 axis. To investigate the nature of the resistance-associated NRG1-expressing cells in human patients, the authors analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing data and observed that such cells appear in a cluster assigned as inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAF). Notably, the gene signature corresponding to these CAFs is highly similar to that shared by adipose stromal cells (ASC) in fat tissue and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAP) in skeletal muscle of cancer-free individuals. Because fibroblasts with the ASC/FAP signature are enriched in various carcinomas, it is possible that the paracrine signaling conferred by NRG1 is a pan-cancer mechanism of FGFR inhibitor resistance and tumor aggressiveness.

Identifying the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for their creation may facilitate the discovery of targets for potential pan-cancer therapeutics. Using a novel computational approach for single-cell gene expression data analysis identifying the dominant cell populations in a sequence of samples from patients at various stages, we conclude that these fibroblasts are produced by a pan-cancer cellular transition originating from a particular type of adipose-derived stromal cells naturally present in the stromal vascular fraction of normal adipose tissue, having a characteristic gene expression signature. Focusing on a rich pancreatic cancer dataset, we provide a detailed description of the continuous modification of the gene expression profiles of cells as they transition from APOD-expressing adipose-derived stromal cells to COL11A1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts, identifying the key genes that participate in this transition.

There has been considerable amount of effort in developing efficient algorithms to select tag SNPs from the growing large-scale data sets. Methods using the classical pairwise-LD and multi-locus LD measures have been proposed that aim to reduce the computational complexity and to increase the accuracy, respectively. The present work solves the tag SNP selection problem by efficiently balancing the computational complexity and accuracy, and improves the coverage in genomic diversity in a cost-effective manner. The employed algorithm makes use of mutual information to explore the multi-locus association between SNPs and can handle different data types and conditions. Experiments with benchmark HapMap data sets show comparable or better performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, as a novel application, the genome-wide SNP tagging is performed in the 1000 Genomes Project data sets, and produced a well-annotated database of tagging variants that capture the common genotype diversity in 2,504 samples from 26 human populations.

In addition to the tumor epithelium, JAK2 is also expressed in other tissues including immune cells; whether the JAK2 mRNA levels in breast tumors correlate with outcomes has not been evaluated. Using a case-control design, JAK2 mRNA was measured in 223 archived breast tumors and associations with distant recurrence were evaluated by logistic regression. The frequency of correct pairwise comparisons of patient rankings based on JAK2 levels versus survival outcomes, the concordance index (CI), was evaluated using data from 2,460 patients in three cohorts. In the case-control study, increased JAK2 was associated with a decreasing risk of recurrence (multivariate P = 0.003, n = 223). Similarly, JAK2 was associated with a protective CI (<0.5) in the public cohorts: NETHERLANDS CI = 0.376, n = 295; METABRIC CI = 0.462, n = 1,981; OSLOVAL CI = 0.452, n = 184. Furthermore, JAK2 was strongly correlated with the favorable prognosis LYM metagene signature for infiltrating T cells (r = 0.5; P < 2 \u00d7 10(-16); n = 1,981) and with severe lymphocyte infiltration (P = 0.00003, n = 156). Moreover, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib potently inhibited the anti-CD3-dependent production of IFN-\u03b3, a marker of the differentiation of Th cells along the tumor-inhibitory Th1 pathway. The potential for JAK2 inhibitors to interfere with the antitumor capacities of T cells should be evaluated.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Janus Kinase 2", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "RNA, Messenger", "Recurrence", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chris P", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Thorpe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda N", "Last Name": "Kortum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine M", "Last Name": "Coy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei-Yi", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tai-Hsien", "Last Name": "Ou Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dimitris", "Last Name": "Anastassiou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J David", "Last Name": "Beatty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole D", "Last Name": "Urban", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Anthony", "Last Name": "Blau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer immunology research", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24066611", "Title": "Notch and VEGF pathways play distinct but complementary roles in tumor angiogenesis.", "Abstract": "Anti-angiogenesis is a validated strategy to treat cancer, with efficacy in controlling both primary tumor growth and metastasis.

In an effort to design a robust prognostic model to predict breast cancer survival, we hypothesized that signatures consisting of genes that are coexpressed in multiple cancer types should correspond to molecular events that are prognostic in all cancers, including breast cancer. We previously identified several such signatures--called attractor metagenes--in an analysis of multiple tumor types. We then tested our attractor metagene hypothesis as participants in the Sage Bionetworks-DREAM Breast Cancer Prognosis Challenge. Using a rich training data set that included gene expression and clinical features for breast cancer patients, we developed a prognostic model that was independently validated in a newly generated patient data set.

However, the similarities of such signatures across different cancer types have not been strong enough to conclude that they represent a universal biological mechanism shared among multiple cancer types. Here we present a computational method for generating signatures using an iterative process that converges to one of several precise attractors defining signatures representing biomolecular events, such as cell transdifferentiation or the presence of an amplicon. By analyzing rich gene expression datasets from different cancer types, we identified several such biomolecular events, some of which are universally present in all tested cancer types in nearly identical form. Although the method is unsupervised, we show that it often leads to attractors with strong phenotypic associations. We present several such multi-cancer attractors, focusing on three that are prominent and sharply defined in all cases: a mesenchymal transition attractor strongly associated with tumor stage, a mitotic chromosomal instability attractor strongly associated with tumor grade, and a lymphocyte-specific attractor.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Computational Biology", "Data Mining", "Databases, Genetic", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genome", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kinetochores", "Mitosis", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Oncogenes", "Phenotype", "Prognosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei-Yi", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tai-Hsien", "Last Name": "Ou Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dimitris", "Last Name": "Anastassiou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2013"}]
