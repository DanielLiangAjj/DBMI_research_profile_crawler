Infection with members of a subgroup of viruses within this genus, the nonpoliovirus enteroviruses (NPEVs), can result in a broad spectrum of serious illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like childhood paralysis; neonatal sepsis; aseptic meningitis; myocarditis; and hand-foot-mouth disease. Despite the diverse primary sites of virus infection, including the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and an array of diseases associated with these infections, there is significant genetic and antigenic similarity among NPEVs. This conservation results in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies that are either able to bind and neutralize or bind but not neutralize multiple NPEVs. Using plaque reduction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assays, we define the antigenic relationship among poliovirus and NPEVs, including multiple isolates of EV-D68, EV-A71, EV-D70, EV-94, EV-111, Coxsackievirus A24v, and rhinovirus. The results reveal extensive cross-reactivity among EVs that cannot be predicted from phylogenetic analysis. Determining the immunologic relationship among EVs is critical to understanding the humoral response elicited during homologous and heterologous virus infections. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses (EVs) are common human pathogens. Although infection with EVs leads to cross-reactive antibodies, the clinical relevance of these antibodies is unclear given the estimated incidence of EV infections in the general population of one per year. The hypothesis that anti-EV cross-reactive antibodies can bind and neutralize heterologous EVs was investigated using polyclonal sera collected from animals immunized with individual EVs. Both binding and neutralization activities against heterologous EVs was observed in these sera, and we speculate that cross-reactive antibodies may modulate infection and disease severity.

Most cases of AFM are pathogen associated, typically with poliovirus and enterovirus infections, and occur in children under the age of 6\u2009years. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated from children with pneumonia in 1962, but an association with AFM was not observed until the 2014 outbreak. Organotypic mouse brain slice cultures generated from postnatal day 1 to 10 mice and adult ifnar knockout mice were used to determine if neurotropism of EV-D68 is shared among virus isolates. All isolates replicated in organotypic mouse brain slice cultures, and three isolates replicated in primary murine astrocyte cultures. All four EV-D68 isolates examined caused paralysis and death in adult ifnar knockout mice. In contrast, no viral disease was observed after intracranial inoculation of wild-type mice. Six of the seven EV-D68 isolates, including two from 1962 and four from the 2014 outbreak, replicated in induced human neurons, and all of the isolates replicated in induced human astrocytes. Furthermore, a putative viral receptor, sialic acid, is not required for neurotropism of EV-D68, as viruses replicated within neurons and astrocytes independent of binding to sialic acid. These observations demonstrate that EV-D68 is neurotropic independent of its genetic lineage and can infect both neurons and astrocytes and that neurotropism is not a recently acquired characteristic as has been suggested. Furthermore, the results show that in mice the innate immune response is critical for restricting EV-D68 disease.IMPORTANCE Since 2014, numerous outbreaks of childhood infections with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) have occurred worldwide. Most infections are associated with flu-like symptoms, but paralysis may develop in young children. It has been suggested that infection only with recent viral isolates can cause paralysis. To address the hypothesis that EV-D68 has recently acquired neurotropism, murine organotypic brain slice cultures, induced human motor neurons and astrocytes, and mice lacking the alpha/beta interferon receptor were infected with multiple virus isolates. All EV-D68 isolates, from 1962 to the present, can infect neural cells, astrocytes, and neurons. Furthermore, our results show that sialic acid binding does not play a role in EV-D68 neuropathogenesis. The study of EV-D68 infection in organotypic brain slice cultures, induced motor neurons, and astrocytes will allow for the elucidation of the mechanism by which the virus infection causes disease.", "Keywords": ["acute flaccid myelitis", "astrocyte", "enterovirus", "neuron", "neurotropism", "picornavirus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Enterovirus D, Human", "Female", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Mice", "N-Acetylneuraminic Acid", "Neuraminidase", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy B", "Last Name": "Rosenfeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey L", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincent R", "Last Name": "Racaniello", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA vrr1@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2019Oct22"}, {"PMID": "30550976", "Title": "Cell-type specificity and functional redundancy of RIG-I-like receptors in innate immune sensing of Coxsackievirus B3 and encephalomyocarditis virus.", "Abstract": "The contributions of RIG-I and MDA5 receptors to sensing viruses of the Picornaviridae family were investigated.

The aspects of cortical development that are affected during virus infection are unknown. Using organotypic brain slice cultures generated from embryonic mice of various ages, sites of ZIKV replication including the neocortical proliferative zone and radial columns, as well as the developing midbrain, were identified. The infected radial units are surrounded by uninfected cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that programmed cell death may limit viral dissemination in the brain and may constrain virus-associated injury. Therefore, a critical aspect of ZIKV-induced neuropathology may be defined by death of uninfected cells. All ZIKV isolates assayed replicated efficiently in early and midgestation cultures, and two isolates examined replicated in late-gestation tissue. Alteration of neocortical cytoarchitecture, such as disruption of the highly elongated basal processes of the radial glial progenitor cells and impairment of postmitotic neuronal migration, were also observed.

Although epithelial cells are the primary site of productive HRV infection, previous studies have implicated macrophages in establishing the cytokine dysregulation that occurs during rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Analysis of the transcriptome of primary human macrophages exposed to major- and minor-group HRV demonstrated differential gene expression. Alterations in gene expression were traced to differential mitochondrial activity and signaling pathway activation between two rhinovirus serotypes, HRV16 (major-group) and HRV1A (minor-group), upon initial HRV binding. Variances in phosphorylation of kinases (p38, JNK, ERK5) and transcription factors (ATF-2, CREB, CEBP-alpha) were observed between the major- and minor-group HRV treatments. Differential activation of signaling pathways led to changes in the production of the asthma-relevant cytokines CCL20, CCL2, and IL-10.

Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an RNA virus.
