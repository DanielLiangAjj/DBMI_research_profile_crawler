[{"PMID": "38772706", "Title": "The Evolution of Mouse Models of Cancer: Past, Present, and Future.", "Abstract": "In the nearly 50 years since the original models of cancer first hit the stage, mouse models have become a major contributor to virtually all aspects of cancer research, and these have evolved well beyond simple transgenic or xenograft models to encompass a wide range of more complex models. As the sophistication of mouse models has increased, an explosion of new technologies has expanded the potential to both further develop and apply these models to address major challenges in cancer research. In the current era, cancer modeling has expanded to include nongermline genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), patient-derived models, organoids, and adaptations of the models better suited for cancer immunology research. New technologies that have transformed the field include the application of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, in vivo imaging, and single-cell analysis to cancer modeling. Here, we provide a historical perspective on the evolution of mouse models of cancer, focusing on how far we have come in a relatively short time and how new technologies will shape the future development of mouse models of cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Abate-Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Urology, Pathology and Cell Biology, Medicine, and Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA cabateshen@columbia.edu katerina.politi@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Katerina", "Last Name": "Politi", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Internal Medicine (Section of Medical Oncology) and Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06405, USA cabateshen@columbia.edu katerina.politi@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine", "PubDate": "2024May21"}, {"PMID": "38627522", "Title": "Correction: In vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies CITED2 as a driver of prostate cancer bone metastasis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juan M", "Last Name": "Arriaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. juan.arriaga@mssm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kacey", "Last Name": "Ronaldson-Bouchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Florencia", "Last Name": "Picech", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francisca", "Last Name": "Nunes de Almeida", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Afari", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Houssein", "Last Name": "Chhouri", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Abate-Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Urology, Medicine, Pathology & Cell Biology, and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. cabateshen@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Oncogene", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38454137", "Title": "In vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies CITED2 as a driver of prostate cancer bone metastasis.", "Abstract": "Most cancer deaths are due to metastatic dissemination to distant organs.

These mCRPC subtypes display increased lineage plasticity and often lack AR expression 2-5 . Here we show that neuroendocrine differentiation and castration-resistance in CRPC-NE are maintained by the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) 6 , which catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). We find that organoid lines established from genetically-engineered mice 7 recapitulate key features of human CRPC-NE, and can display transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states in culture. CRPC-NE organoids express elevated levels of NSD2 and H3K36me2 marks, but relatively low levels of H3K27me3, consistent with antagonism of EZH2 activity by H3K36me2. Human CRPC-NE but not primary NEPC tumors expresses high levels of NSD2, consistent with a key role for NSD2 in lineage plasticity, and high NSD2 expression in mCRPC correlates with poor survival outcomes. Notably, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of NSD2 or expression of a dominant-negative oncohistone H3.3K36M mutant results in loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes and restores responsiveness to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide in mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids and grafts.

performing coclinical studies using patient-derived models in real time is often unfeasible. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework that predicts drug sensitivity in human tumors and their preexisting high-fidelity (cognate) model(s) by leveraging drug perturbation profiles. As a proof of concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that recapitulate a broad spectrum of disease states, including castration-resistant, metastatic, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of human prostate cancer cohorts by Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis revealed that most patients with advanced prostate cancer were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT). Drugs predicted to invert MR activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated in allograft, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of tumors and metastasis. Furthermore, OncoLoop-predicted drugs enhanced the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs, namely, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the AR inhibitor enzalutamide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

We found that castration resulted in increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its probable murine homolog Cxcl15 in prostate epithelial cells. We showed that these chemokines drove subsequent intratumoral infiltration of tumor-promoting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which was largely abrogated when IL-8 signaling was blocked genetically or pharmacologically. Targeting IL-8 signaling in combination with ICB delayed the onset of castration resistance and increased the density of polyfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors.

One method is based on the delivery of adenoviruses that express Cre recombinase in selected cell types in the urothelium, and a second uses transgenic drivers in which activation of inducible Cre alleles can be limited to the bladder urothelium by intravesicular delivery of tamoxifen. Using both approaches, targeted deletion of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes specifically in basal urothelial cells gave rise to muscle-invasive bladder tumors. Furthermore, preinvasive lesions arising in basal cells displayed upregulation of molecular pathways related to bladder tumorigenesis, including proinflammatory pathways.

against the tumor-promoting effects of oxidative stress. Here we show that the prostate-specific homeoprotein NKX3.1 suppresses prostate cancer initiation by protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress. Integrating analyses of genetically engineered mouse models, human prostate cancer cells, and human prostate cancer organotypic cultures, we find that, in response to oxidative stress, NKX3.1 is imported to mitochondria via the chaperone protein HSPA9, where it regulates transcription of mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes, thereby restoring oxidative phosphorylation and preventing cancer initiation. Germline polymorphisms of NKX3.1 associated with increased cancer risk fail to protect from oxidative stress or suppress tumorigenicity. Low expression levels of NKX3.1 combined with low expression of mitochondrial ETC genes are associated with adverse clinical outcome, whereas high levels of mitochondrial NKX3.1 protein are associated with favorable outcome. This work reveals an extranuclear role for NKX3.1 in suppression of prostate cancer by protecting mitochondrial function. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings uncover a nonnuclear function for NKX3.1 that is a key mechanism for suppression of prostate cancer. Analyses of the expression levels and subcellular localization of NKX3.1 in patients at risk of cancer progression may improve risk assessment in a precision prevention paradigm, particularly for men

Immunoediting in a Prostate Tumor Model.", "Abstract": "The theory of cancer immunoediting, which describes the dynamic interactions between tumors and host immune cells that shape the character of each compartment, is foundational for understanding cancer immunotherapy. Few models exist that facilitate in-depth study of each of the three canonical phases of immunoediting: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Here, we utilized NPK-C1, a transplantable prostate tumor model that we found recapitulated the three phases of immunoediting spontaneously in immunocompetent animals. Given that a significant portion of NPK-C1 tumors reliably progressed to the escape phase, we were able to delineate cell types and mechanisms differentially prevalent in equilibrium versus escape phases. Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, we found that activated CD4+ effector T cells were enriched in regressing tumors, highlighting a role for CD4+ T cells in antitumor immunity. CD8+ T cells were also important for NPK-C1 control, specifically, central memory-like cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg), as a whole, were counterintuitively enriched in regressing tumors; however, high-dimensional analysis revealed their significant phenotypic diversity, with a number of Treg subpopulations enriched in progressing tumors. In the myeloid compartment, we found that iNOS+ dendritic cell (DC)-like cells are enriched in regressing tumors, whereas CD103+ DCs were associated with late-stage tumor progression. In total, these analyses of the NPK-C1 model provide novel insights into the roles of lymphoid and myeloid populations throughout the cancer immunoediting process and highlight a role for multidimensional, flow-based analyses to more deeply understand immune cell dynamics in the tumor microenvironment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Flow Cytometry", "Integrin alpha Chains", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Phenotype", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tumor Burden", "Tumor Escape", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Casey R", "Last Name": "Ager", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Aleksandar Z", "Last Name": "Obradovic", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Juan M", "Last Name": "Arriaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew G", "Last Name": "Chaimowitz", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Abate-Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles G", "Last Name": "Drake", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York. cgd2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cancer immunology research", "PubDate": "2021May"}, {"PMID": "33434495", "Title": "A modular master regulator landscape controls cancer transcriptional identity.", "Abstract": "Despite considerable efforts, the mechanisms linking genomic alterations to the transcriptional identity of cancer cells remain elusive.

These electroporation-based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMM) recapitulate features of traditional germline models and, by modeling genetic factors linked to late-stage human disease, can produce tumors that are metastatic and castration-resistant. A subset of tumors with Trp53 alterations acquired spontaneous WNT pathway alterations, which are also associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Using the EPO-GEMM approach and an orthogonal organoid-based model, we show that WNT pathway activation drives metastatic disease that is sensitive to pharmacologic WNT pathway inhibition. Thus, by leveraging EPO-GEMMs, we reveal a functional role for WNT signaling in driving prostate cancer metastasis and validate the WNT pathway as therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Our understanding of the factors driving metastatic prostate cancer is limited by the paucity of models of late-stage disease.

Based on analysis of genetically engineered mouse models combined with correlative analysis of expression profiling data from human prostate tumors, we demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between inflammation and the status of the NKX3.1 homeobox gene associated with prostate cancer initiation. We find that cancer initiation in aged Nkx3.1 mutant mice correlates with enrichment of specific immune populations and increased expression of immunoregulatory genes. Furthermore, expression of these immunoregulatory genes is similarly increased in human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 expression. We further show that induction of prostatitis in Nkx3.1 mutant mice accelerates prostate cancer initiation, which is coincident with aberrant cellular plasticity and differentiation. Correspondingly, human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 have de-regulated expression of genes associated with these cellular processes.

Such cellular plasticity can be triggered by physiological or oncogenic stress, or it can be experimentally induced through cellular reprogramming. Notably, physiological stresses that promote plasticity, such as severe tissue damage, inflammation, or senescence, also represent hallmarks of cancer. Furthermore, key drivers of cellular plasticity include major oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways and can be exacerbated by drug treatment.

Here, we provide novel insights into treatment response for the antiandrogen abiraterone by analyses of a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with combined inactivation of Trp53 and Pten, which are frequently comutated in human CRPC. These NPp53 mice fail to respond to abiraterone and display accelerated progression to tumors resembling treatment-related CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) in humans. Cross-species computational analyses identify master regulators of adverse response that are conserved with human CRPC-NE, including the neural differentiation factor SOX11, which promotes neuroendocrine differentiation in cells derived from NPp53 tumors. Furthermore, abiraterone-treated NPp53 prostate tumors contain regions of focal and/or overt neuroendocrine differentiation, distinguished by their proliferative potential. Notably, lineage tracing in vivo provides definitive and quantitative evidence that focal and overt neuroendocrine regions arise by transdifferentiation of luminal adenocarcinoma cells. These findings underscore principal roles for TP53 and PTEN inactivation in abiraterone resistance and progression from adenocarcinoma to CRPC-NE by transdifferentiation.Significance: Understanding adverse treatment response and identifying patients likely to fail treatment represent fundamental clinical challenges. By integrating analyses of GEM models and human clinical data, we provide direct genetic evidence for transdifferentiation as a mechanism of drug resistance as well as for stratifying patients for treatment with antiandrogens.

Here we show that expression of the tumor suppressor p14ARF (ARF) is upregulated in aggressive subtypes of MIBC. Accumulation of ARF in the nucleolus is associated with poor outcome and attenuated response to chemotherapy. In both genetically engineered mouse models and murine xenograft models of human MIBC, we demonstrate that tumors expressing ARF failed to respond to treatment with the platinum-based chemotherapy agent cisplatin.

Distinguishing the many indolent tumors from the minority of lethal ones remains a major clinical challenge. We now show that low Gleason score prostate tumors can be distinguished as indolent and aggressive subgroups on the basis of their expression of genes associated with aging and senescence. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms. Furthermore, protein expression of this three-gene panel in biopsy samples distinguished Gleason 6 patients who failed surveillance over a 10-year period.

We now report that the oncogenic Ets variant 4 (Etv4) promotes prostate cancer metastasis in response to coactivation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling pathways in a genetically engineered mouse model of highly penetrant, metastatic prostate cancer. Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases.

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REG\u03b3. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REG\u03b3 or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REG\u03b3-dependent mechanism.

We evaluated three chemotherapy agents, namely cisplatin, gemcitabine, and docetaxel, which are currently in use clinically for systemic treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer and/or have been evaluated for intravesical therapy. These preclinical studies were done using a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model that progresses from carcinoma in situ (CIS) to invasive, metastatic bladder cancer.

Of the three single agents tested, gemcitabine was most effective for preventing progression to invasive disease, as assessed by several relevant endpoints. However, the combinations of two agents, and particularly those including gemcitabine, were more effective for reducing both tumor and metastatic burden.

In a Nkx3.1:Pten mutant mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates the human disease, MED1 protein levels were markedly elevated in the epithelium of both invasive and castration-resistant adenocarcinoma prostate tissues. Mechanistic evidence showed that hyperactivated ERK and/or AKT signaling pathways promoted MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer cells. Notably, ectopic MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer xenografts significantly promoted tumor growth in nude mice.
