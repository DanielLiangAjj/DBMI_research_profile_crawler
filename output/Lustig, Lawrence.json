Yet, no research has characterized otolaryngology residency program directors' attitudes toward SGM-related curricula, nor opportunities for supporting training in SGM-related care. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional e-mail survey was disseminated to 116 otolaryngology residency program directors in July-September 2019. Information collected included current/future curriculum in and attitudes toward SGM care, and program demographics. Data were categorical and analysis utilized chi-square test. Results: The 65 complete responses (56% rate) were nationally representative. Overall, 17% of programs include no SGM-related education. Subjective importance of SGM training ranged from not important at all (3%) to absolutely essential (11%), with mode of average importance (47%); this varied significantly by program geographic setting and population, and program size. The mean percentage of curriculum dedicated to SGM care was 1.0% for didactics and 0.7% for clinical. Curricula include HIV/AIDS-related conditions (58%), facial gender-affirming procedures (50%), culturally informed care (42%), changes with gender-affirming hormones (voice/communication: 48%, facial: 22%), and cancer in SGM patients (42%). Frequently reported barriers were insufficient experienced faculty (52%) and time (42%). Program directors deemed visiting expert lectures (66%), small-group discussion (39%), and online modules (27%) the best ways to incorporate SGM education. Conclusions: More than 80% of otolaryngology residency curricula in a representative national survey include SGM-related education, which represents a limited portion of total curriculum. These results highlight the opportunity for expert lectures and discussion-based and online tool development to facilitate standardized SGM education in otolaryngology residencies.", "Keywords": ["LGBTQ", "gender-affirming care", "medical education", "otolaryngology", "sexual and gender minority"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Teddy G", "Last Name": "Goetz", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Nieman", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott R", "Last Name": "Chaiet", "Affiliation": "Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shane D", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "Division of Plastic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Cabrera-Muffly", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence R", "Last Name": "Lustig", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Transgender health", "PubDate": "2021Oct"}, {"PMID": "34622965", "Title": "Impact of COVID-19 on Otolaryngology Literature.", "Abstract": "To understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volume, quality, and impact of otolaryngology publications.", "Keywords": ["Bibliometrics", "COVID-19", "publication trends", "scientific publication"], "MeSH terms": ["Bibliometrics", "COVID-19", "Humans", "Otolaryngology", "Pandemics", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yeshwant R", "Last Name": "Chillakuru", "Affiliation": "Division of Otolaryngology -

American Otological Society, and American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Foundation Guide to Enhance Otologic and Neurotologic Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "Abstract": ": This combined American Neurotology Society, American Otological Society, and American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation document aims to provide guidance during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) on 1) \"priority\" of care for otologic and neurotologic patients in the office and operating room, and 2) optimal utilization of personal protective equipment. Given the paucity of evidence to inform otologic and neurotologic best practices during COVID-19, the recommendations herein are based on relevant peer-reviewed articles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 guidelines, United States and international hospital policies, and expert opinion. The suggestions presented here are not meant to be definitive, and best practices will undoubtedly change with increasing knowledge and high-quality data related to COVID-19. Interpretation of this guidance document is dependent on local factors including prevalence of COVID-19 in the surgeons' local community. This is not intended to set a standard of care, and should not supersede the clinician's best judgement when managing specific clinical concerns and/or regional conditions.Access to otologic and neurotologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent upon adequate protection of physicians, audiologists, and ancillary support staff. Otolaryngologists and associated staff are at high risk for COVID-19 disease transmission based on close contact with mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic procedures. While many otologic and neurotologic conditions are not imminently life threatening, they have a major impact on communication, daily functioning, and quality of life. In addition, progression of disease and delay in treatment can result in cranial nerve deficits, intracranial and life-threatening complications, and/or irreversible consequences. In this regard, many otologic and neurotologic conditions should rightfully be considered \"urgent,\" and almost all require timely attention to permit optimal outcomes. It is reasonable to proceed with otologic and neurotologic clinic visits and operative cases based on input from expert opinion of otologic care providers, clinic/hospital administration, infection prevention and control specialists, and local and state public health leaders. Significant regional variations in COVID-19 prevalence exist; therefore, physicians working with local municipalities are best suited to make determinations on the appropriateness and timing of otologic and neurotologic care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.", "Coronavirus Infections",

{"PMID": "30783980", "Title": "AAV-Mediated Gene Delivery to the Inner Ear.", "Abstract": "Cochlear gene therapy has made tremendous strides over the past 5\u00a0years. The first study documenting successful restoration of congenital hearing loss using AAV-mediated gene therapy occurred in a mouse model of deafness lacking vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT 3). This study utilized a trans-bulla round window membrane (RWM) delivery approach. Since this study, these methodologies have been applied to a number of other mouse models of genetic deafness with varying degrees of success, lending promise for future clinical application of this burgeoning technology.

Both genetic and environmental etiologies are linked to hearing loss, but in many cases the underlying cellular pathophysiology is not well understood, highlighting the importance of further discovery. We found that inactivation of the gene Tmtc4 (transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat 4), which was broadly expressed in the mouse cochlea, caused acquired hearing loss in mice. Our data showed Tmtc4 enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum, and that it functioned by regulating Ca2+ dynamics and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Given this genetic linkage of the UPR to hearing loss, we demonstrated a direct link between the more common noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the UPR. These experiments suggested a novel approach to treatment. We demonstrated that the small-molecule UPR and stress response modulator ISRIB (integrated stress response inhibitor), which activates eIF2B, prevented NIHL in a mouse model. Moreover, in an inverse genetic complementation approach, we demonstrated that mice with homozygous inactivation of both Tmtc4 and Chop had less hearing loss than knockout of Tmtc4 alone.

Auditory nerve survival is likely one of the major factors underlying this variability. Neurotrophin therapy therefore has been proposed for CI recipients, with the goal of improving outcomes by promoting improved survival of cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and/or residual hair cells. Previous studies have shown that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3 can rescue SGNs following insult. The current study was designed to determine whether adeno-associated virus vector serotype 5 (AAV-5) encoding either green fluorescent protein or GDNF can transduce cells in the mouse cochlea to express useful levels of neurotrophin and to approximate the optimum therapeutic dose(s) for transducing hair cells and SGN. The findings demonstrate that AAV-5 is a potentially useful gene therapy vector for the cochlea, resulting in extremely high levels of transgene expression in the cochlear inner hair cells and SGN. However, overexpression of human GDNF in newborn mice caused severe neurological symptoms and hearing loss, likely due to Purkinje cell loss and cochlear nucleus pathology.

Early onset profound hearing loss in KO mice and lack of information about the cochlear cell type that requires Clrn1 expression pose challenges to therapeutic investigation. We generated KO mice harboring a transgene, TgAC1, consisting of Clrn1-UTR (Clrn1 cDNA including its 5' and 3' UTR) under the control of regulatory elements (Atoh1 3' enhancer/\u03b2-globin basal promoter) to direct expression of Clrn1 in hair cells during development and down regulate it postnatally. The KO-TgAC1 mice displayed delayed onset progressive hearing loss associated with deterioration of the hair bundle structure, leading to the hypothesis that hair cell expression of Clrn1 is essential for postnatal preservation of hair cell structure and hearing. Consistent with that hypothesis, perinatal transfection of hair cells in KO-TgAC1 mice with a single injection of AAV-Clrn1-UTR vector showed correlative preservation of the hair bundle structure and hearing through adult life.

We show that a single delivery of the sans cDNA by the adenoassociated virus 8 to the inner ear of newborn mutant mice reestablishes the expression and targeting of the protein to the tips of stereocilia. The therapeutic gene restores the architecture and mechanosensitivity of stereociliary bundles, improves hearing thresholds, and durably rescues these mice from the balance defects. Our results open up new perspectives for efficient gene therapy of cochlear and vestibular disorders by showing that even severe dysmorphogenesis of stereociliary bundles can be corrected.", "Keywords": ["Usher", "balance", "gene", "mouse", "therapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "DNA, Complementary", "Dependovirus", "Disease Models, Animal", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Usher Syndromes", "Vestibule, Labyrinth"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Emptoz", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Michel", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Lelli", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Akil", "Affiliation": "Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94117."}, {"First Name": "Jacques", "Last Name": "Boutet de Monvel", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ghizlene", "Last Name": "Lahlou", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ana\u00efs", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Typhaine", "Last Name": "Dupont", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Nouaille", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Elody", "Last Name": "Ey", "Affiliation": "Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Humaine et Fonctions Cognitives, Institut Pasteur, CNRS UMR 3571, 75015 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Filipa", "Last Name": "Franca de Barros", "Affiliation": "Centre de Neurophysique, Physiologie, et Pathologie, CNRS UMR 8119, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes, 75006 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Mathieu", "Last Name": "Beraneck", "Affiliation": "Centre de Neurophysique, Physiologie, et Pathologie, CNRS UMR 8119, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes, 75006 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Dulon", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Neurophysiologie de la Synapse Auditive, Bordeaux Neurocampus, INSERM, UMR 1120, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, 33076 Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Pierre", "Last Name": "Hardelin", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Lustig", "Affiliation": "Columbia University School of Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10034."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Avan", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Biophysique Sensorielle, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 d'Auvergne, Biophysique M\u00e9dicale, Centre Jean Perrin, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Petit", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France; christine.petit@pasteur.fr saaid.safieddine@pasteur.fr."}, {"First Name": "Saaid", "Last Name": "Safieddine", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1120, Paris, France; christine.petit@pasteur.fr saaid.safieddine@pasteur.fr."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2017Sep05"}, {"PMID": "28280753", "Title": "Mouse Auditory Brainstem Response Testing.", "Abstract": "The auditory brainstem response (ABR) test provides information about the inner ear (cochlea) and the central pathways for hearing.

We identified two novel genome-wide significant SNPs: rs4932196 (odds ratio = 1.185, p = 4.0x10-11), 52Kb 3' of ISG20, which replicated in a meta-analysis of the other GERA race/ethnicity groups (1,025 cases, 12,388 controls, p = 0.00094) and in a UK Biobank case-control analysis (30,802 self-reported cases, 78,586 controls, p = 0.015); and rs58389158 (odds ratio = 1.132, p = 1.8x10-9), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00021).

Whereas osteoblasts deposit and osteoclasts resorb bone matrix, osteocytes both dynamically resorb and replace perilacunar bone matrix. Osteocytes secrete proteases like matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) to maintain the material quality of bone matrix through perilacunar remodeling (PLR). Deregulated bone remodeling impairs bone quality and can compromise hearing since the auditory transduction mechanism is within bone. Understanding the mechanisms regulating cochlear bone provides unique ways to assess bone quality independent of other aspects that contribute to bone mechanical behavior. Cochlear bone is singular in its regulation of remodeling by expressing high levels of osteoprotegerin. Since cochlear bone expresses a key PLR enzyme, MMP13, we examined whether cochlear bone relies on, or is protected from, osteocyte-mediated PLR to maintain hearing and bone quality using a mouse model lacking MMP13 (MMP13(-/-)). We investigated the canalicular network, collagen organization, lacunar volume via micro-computed tomography, and dynamic histomorphometry. Despite finding defects in these hallmarks of PLR in MMP13(-/-) long bones, cochlear bone revealed no differences in these markers, nor hearing loss as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) or distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs), between wild type and MMP13(-/-) mice. Dynamic histomorphometry revealed abundant PLR by tibial osteocytes, but near absence in cochlear bone. Cochlear suppression of PLR corresponds to repression of several key PLR genes in the cochlea relative to long bones. These data suggest that cochlear bone uniquely maintains bone quality and hearing independent of MMP13-mediated osteocytic PLR. Furthermore, the cochlea employs parallel mechanisms to inhibit remodeling by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and by osteocytes, to protect hearing. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that confer site-specific control of bone remodeling has the potential to elucidate new pathways that are deregulated in skeletal disease.", "Keywords": ["Bone matrix", "Bone remodeling", "Collagen", "Matrix mineralization", "Mouse model", "Osteocytes", "Perilacunar remodeling"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Remodeling", "Cochlea", "Hearing", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 13", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emmanuel J", "Last Name": "J\u00e1uregui", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States."}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Akil", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States."}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Acevedo", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States; Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Faith", "Last Name": "Hall-Glenn", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States."}, {"First Name": "Betty S", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hrishikesh A", "Last Name": "Bale", "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Liebenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mary Beth", "Last Name": "Humphrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert O", "Last Name": "Ritchie", "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence R", "Last Name": "Lustig", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tamara", "Last Name": "Alliston", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States; Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, United States.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms responsible for this hearing loss, which could be sensorineural and/or conductive, remain unclear. In this study, we used a unique transgenic mouse model of increased Gs G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling induced by expression of an engineered receptor, Rs1, in osteoblastic cells. These ColI(2.3)+/Rs1+ mice showed dramatic bone lesions that histologically and radiologically resembled fibrous dysplasia.

While sensorineural structures were unaffected, ColI(2.3)+/Rs1+ cochleae had abnormally high osteoclast activity, together with elevated tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl) mRNA expression. ColI(2.3)+/Rs1+ cochleae also showed decreased expression of Sclerostin (Sost), an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway that normally increases bone formation. The osteocyte canalicular networks of ColI(2.3)+/Rs1+ cochleae were disrupted and showed abnormal osteocyte morphology. The osteocytes in the ColI(2.3)+/Rs1+ cochleae showed increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and TRAP, both of which can support osteocyte-mediated peri-lacunar remodeling. Thus, while the ossicular chain impingement is sufficient to account for the progressive hearing loss in fibrous dysplasia, the deregulation of bone remodeling extends to the cochlea as well. Our findings suggest that factors regulating bone remodeling, including peri-lacunar remodeling by osteocytes, may be useful targets for treating the bony overgrowths and hearing changes of fibrous dysplasia and other bony pathologies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Remodeling", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Cochlea", "Collagen Type I", "Disease Models, Animal", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Fibrous Dysplasia of Bone", "Hearing Loss", "Hearing Loss, Conductive", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Osteoclasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Akil", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Faith", "Last Name": "Hall-Glenn", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jolie", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alfred", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Endocrine Unit and Bone Imaging Core, San Francisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wenhan", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Endocrine Unit and Bone Imaging Core, San Francisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence R", "Last Name": "Lustig", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tamara", "Last Name": "Alliston", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Edward C", "Last Name": "Hsiao", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, and the Institute for Human Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24114870", "Title": "Cochlear implant fixation using a subperiosteal tight pocket without either suture or bone-recess technique.", "Abstract": "To assess the complication and migration rates associated with the fixation of cochlear implant receiver-stimulators using a subperiosteal tight pocket without either suture fixation or bone recession.", "Keywords": ["Cochlear implant", "fixation", "minimal access", "subperiosteal", "surgical technique", "temporalis pocket"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cochlear Implants", "Deafness", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Periosteum", "Retrospective Studies", "Suture Techniques", "Sutures", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Jethanamest", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (D.J., G.A.C., F.F.T.), Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Guyan A", "Last Name": "Channer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Moss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence R", "Last Name": "Lustig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fred F", "Last Name": "Telischi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Laryngoscope", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24080981", "Title": "Cost of placement and complications associated with osseointegrated bone-conducting hearing prostheses: a retrospective analysis of medicare billing data.", "Abstract": "To report the cost of placement and complications related to osseointegrated bone-conducting hearing prostheses (OBHPs) in a Medicare population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bone Conduction", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Hearing Aids", "Humans", "Male", "Medicare", "Middle Aged", "Osseointegration", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seth E", "Last Name": "Pross", "Affiliation": "*Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of California San Francisco;
