However, tissue rejection and graft-versus-host disease are relatively common complications, necessitating aggressive immunosuppression that can itself pose further complications. Tracking intraluminal markers in ileal effluent from standard ileostomies may present a noninvasive and sensitive way to detect developing pathology within the intestinal graft. This would be an improvement compared to current assessments, which are limited by poor sensitivity and specificity, contributing to under or over-immunosuppression, respectively, and by the need for invasive biopsies. Herein, we report an approach to reproducibly analyze ileal fluid obtained through stoma sampling for antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations, reasoning that these molecules may provide an assessment of intestinal homeostasis and levels of intestinal inflammation over time. Concentrations of lysozyme (LYZ), myeloperoxidase (MPO), calprotectin (S100A8/A9) and \u03b2-defensin 2 (DEFB2) were assessed using adaptations of commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The concentration of \u03b1-defensin 5 (DEFA5) was assessed using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. Our data support that with proper preparation of ileal effluent specimens, precise and replicable determination of antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations can be achieved for each of these target molecules via ELISA. This approach may prove to be reliable as a clinically useful assessment of intestinal homeostasis over time for patients with ileostomies.", "Keywords": ["Crohn's disease", "ELISA", "Intestinal transplantation", "Methods", "Transplantation immunology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antimicrobial Peptides", "Intestines", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "alpha-Defensins", "Biopsy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julie S", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center of Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.

Because availability is limited, risk stratification of candidates is crucial for optimizing both organ allocations and transplant outcomes. Here we utilize proteomics prior to transplant to identify new biomarkers that predict post-transplant survival in a multi-institutional cohort. Microvesicles were isolated from serum samples and underwent proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) was used to predict survival after transplant incorporating select recipient pre-transplant clinical characteristics and serum microvesicle proteomic data. We identified six protein markers with prediction performance above AUROC of 0.6, including Prothrombin (F2), anti-plasmin (SERPINF2), Factor IX, carboxypeptidase 2 (CPB2), HGF activator (HGFAC) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK). No clinical characteristics demonstrated an AUROC\u2009>\u20090.6. Putative biological functions and pathways were assessed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Differential expression analysis identified enriched pathways prior to transplant that were associated with post-transplant survival including activation of platelets and the coagulation pathway prior to transplant. Specifically, upregulation of coagulation cascade components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and downregulation of kininogen prior to transplant were associated with survival after transplant.

Data from single-cell transcriptomic, clonal correspondence and in vitro differentiation assays support the notion of intrathymic CD138+ plasma cell differentiation, alongside other B cell subsets with distinctive molecular phenotypes.

Integrated analyses identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, thereby providing insight into the biology of lethal COVID-19. The lungs from individuals with COVID-19 were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages, but had impaired T cell responses. Monocyte/macrophage-derived interleukin-1\u03b2 and epithelial cell-derived interleukin-6 were unique features of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Alveolar type 2 cells adopted an inflammation-associated transient progenitor cell state and failed to undergo full transition into alveolar type 1 cells, resulting in impaired lung regeneration. Furthermore, we identified expansion of recently described CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblasts3 contributing to rapidly ensuing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19.

challenge for future transplantation in these patients. The differential effects of Heartmate 3 (HM3) versus Heartmate II (HMII) on de novo HLA allosensitization remain unknown. Patients who underwent HMII or HM3 implantation and had no prior HLA antibodies by solid-phase assay (Luminex) testing were included in this study. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels and Luminex antibody profiles were followed until cardiac transplantation, device explantation, or death. Electronic medical records were reviewed to examine posttransplant outcomes. Thirty-eight HM3 and 34 HMII patients with complete data were followed for 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 years on device support. HM3 and HMII groups had similar age at implant, female gender, ischemic heart failure etiology, bridge strategy at implant, as well as intraoperative and postoperative transfusion requirements. 39.5% of HM3 and 47.1% of HMII patients developed detectable HLA antibodies by Luminex testing (p\u2009=\u20090.516). Development of high-level (mean fluorescence intensity >10,000) antibodies was significantly lower in HM3 than HMII patients (5.3 vs. 20.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.049). CDC PRA testing showed fewer HM3 patients with a positive result (PRA > 0%) than HMII patients (39.4 vs. 70.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.015). Among transplanted patients, those who had developed de novo sensitization on LVAD support showed a trend toward incidence of moderate to severe grade rejection compared with unsensitized patients (23.8 vs. 4.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.078).

Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control.

Non-HLA antibodies with pathogenic potential have also been described, including natural antibodies (Nabs). These IgG Nabs bind to immunogenic self-determinants, including oxidation-related antigens.Methods To examine the relationship of Nabs with graft outcomes, we assessed Nabs in blinded serum specimens collected from a retrospective cohort of 635 patients who received a transplant between 2005 and 2010 at Necker Hospital in Paris, France. Serum samples were obtained immediately before transplant and at the time of biopsy-proven rejection within the first year or 1 year after transplant. Nabs were detected by ELISA through reactivity to the generic oxidized epitope malondialdehyde.Results Univariate Cox regression analysis identified the development of post-transplant Nabs (defined as 50% increase in reactivity to malondialdehyde) as a significant risk factor for graft loss (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.49 to 4.82; P=0.001). Post-transplant Nabs also correlated with increased mean Banff scores for histologic signs of graft injury in post-transplant biopsy specimens. Multivariable Cox analyses confirmed Nabs development as a risk factor independent from anti-HLA DSAs (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 4.17; P=0.04). Moreover, patients with Nabs and DSAs had a further increased risk of kidney graft loss.Conclusions These findings reveal an association between Nabs, kidney graft injury, and eventual graft failure, suggesting the involvement of Nabs in immune mechanisms of rejection.", "Keywords": ["DSA", "natural antibodies", "natural polyreactive antibodies", "non-HLA antibodies", "oxidation-specific epitopes"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Allografts", "Female", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Malondialdehyde", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Period", "Preoperative Period", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah B", "Last Name": "See", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Aubert", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, Hopital Necker, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Loupy", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, Hopital Necker, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Yokarla", "Last Name": "Veras", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xavier", "Last Name": "Lebreton", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, Hopital Necker, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology/Transplant Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Christophe", "Last Name": "Legendre", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, Hopital Necker, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Dany", "Last Name": "Anglicheau", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, Hopital Necker, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Zorn", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; ez2184@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "PubDate": "2018Jun"}, {"PMID": "29184907", "Title": "Comparative Assessment of Anti-HLA Antibodies Using Two Commercially Available Luminex-Based Assays.", "Abstract": "Allospecific anti-HLA antibodies (Abs) are associated with rejection of solid organ grafts.

In humans, plasma cells residing primarily in the bone marrow confer long-lasting protection to common viruses by secreting antigen-specific antibodies. Since the thymus also houses B cells, we examined the phenotypic complexity of these thymic resident cells and their possible protective role against viral infections. Using tissue specimens collected from subjects ranging in age from 5 days to 71 years, we found that starting during the first year of life, CD138+ plasma cells (PC) begin accumulating in the thymic perivascular space (PVS) where they constitutively produce IgG without the need for additional stimulation. These, thymic PC secrete almost exclusively IgG1 and IgG3, the two main complement-fixing effector IgG subclasses. Moreover, using antigen-specific ELISpot assays, we demonstrated that thymic PC include a high frequency of cells reactive to common viral proteins. Our study reveals an unrecognized role of the PVS as a functional niche for viral-specific PCs. The PVS is located between the thymic epithelial areas and the circulation.
