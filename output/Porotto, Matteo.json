There are no approved therapeutics for MeV. Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral fusion are one potential therapeutic approach but have not yet been structurally characterized or advanced to clinical use. We present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of prefusion F alone [2.1-angstrom (\u00c5) resolution], F complexed with a fusion-inhibitory peptide (2.3-\u00c5 resolution), F complexed with the neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 (2.6-\u00c5 resolution), and an additional structure of postfusion F (2.7-\u00c5 resolution). In vitro assays and examination of additional EM classes show that mAb 77 binds prefusion F, arrests F in an intermediate state, and prevents transition to the postfusion conformation. These structures shed light on antibody-mediated neutralization that involves arrest of fusion proteins in an intermediate state.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Measles

"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal late neurological complication of measles, caused by persistent measles virus (MeV) infection of the central nervous system. There are no drugs approved for the treatment of SSPE. Here, we followed the clinical progression of a 5-year-old SSPE patient after treatment with the nucleoside analog remdesivir, conducted a post-mortem evaluation of the patient's brain, and characterized the MeV detected in the brain. The quality of life of the patient transiently improved after the first two courses of remdesivir, but a third course had no further clinical effect, and the patient eventually succumbed to his condition. Post-mortem evaluation of the brain displayed histopathological changes including loss of neurons and demyelination paired with abundant presence of MeV RNA-positive cells throughout the brain. Next-generation sequencing of RNA isolated from the brain revealed a complete MeV genome with mutations that are typically detected in SSPE, characterized by a hypermutated M gene. Additional mutations were detected in the polymerase (L) gene, which were not associated with resistance to remdesivir. Functional characterization showed that mutations in the F gene led to a hyperfusogenic phenotype predominantly mediated by N465I. Additionally, recombinant wild-type-based MeV with the SSPE-F gene or the F gene with the N465I mutation was no longer lymphotropic but instead efficiently disseminated in neural cultures. Altogether, this case encourages further investigation of remdesivir as a potential treatment of SSPE and highlights the necessity to functionally understand SSPE-causing MeV.IMPORTANCEMeasles virus (MeV) causes acute, systemic disease and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. Despite the lack of known entry receptors in the brain, MeV can persistently infect the brain causing the rare but fatal neurological disorder subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). SSPE-causing MeVs are characterized by a hypermutated genome and a hyperfusogenic F protein that facilitates the rapid spread of MeV throughout the brain. No treatment against SSPE is available, but the nucleoside analog remdesivir was recently demonstrated to be effective against MeV in vitro. We show that treatment of an SSPE patient with remdesivir led to transient clinical improvement and did not induce viral escape mutants, encouraging the future use of remdesivir in SSPE patients.

They are enveloped viruses harboring a non-segmented negative-sense RNA. Morbilliviruses are extremely contagious and transmitted through infectious aerosol droplets. Both MeV and CDV may cause respiratory infections and fatal encephalitis, although a high incidence of brain infections is unique to CDV. Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine against these viruses, in recent years we are witnessing a strong resurgence of Morbillivirus infection. Measles still kills more than 100,000 people each year, and CDV causes widespread outbreaks, especially among wild animals, including non-human primates. No drugs are currently approved for MeV and CDV. Therefore, the identification of effective antiviral agents represents an unmet medical need. Here, we have investigated the potential antiviral properties of nitazoxanide (NTZ) against MeV and CDV. Antiviral activity was explored with live virus and cell-based assays. NTZ is a thiazolide that is approved by the FDA as an antiprotozoal agent for the treatment of Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium parvum. Further, nitazoxanide and its metabolite tizoxanide have recently emerged as broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We found that NTZ blocks the MeV and CDV replication, acting at the post-entry level. Moreover, we showed that NTZ affects the function of the viral fusion protein (F), impairing viral spread.

Capture and fusion require the prefusion S2 to transit to its potent fusogenic form, the fusion intermediate (FI). However, the FI structure is unknown, detailed computational models of the FI are unavailable, and the mechanisms and timing of membrane capture and fusion are not established. Here, we constructed a full-length model of the SARS-CoV-2 FI by extrapolating from known SARS-CoV-2 pre- and postfusion structures. In atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations the FI was remarkably flexible and executed giant bending and extensional fluctuations due to three hinges in the C-terminal base. The simulated configurations and their giant fluctuations are quantitatively consistent with SARS-CoV-2 FI configurations measured recently using cryo-electron tomography. Simulations suggested a host cell membrane capture time of \u223c2 ms. Isolated fusion peptide simulations identified an N-terminal helix that directed and maintained binding to the membrane but grossly underestimated the binding time, showing that the fusion peptide environment is radically altered when attached to its host fusion protein. The large configurational fluctuations of the FI generated a substantial exploration volume that aided capture of the target membrane, and may set the waiting time for fluctuation-triggered refolding of the FI that draws the viral envelope and host cell membrane together for fusion. These results describe the FI as machinery that uses massive configurational fluctuations for efficient membrane capture and suggest novel potential drug targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tara C", "Last Name": "Marcink", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Porotto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Moscona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "O'Shaughnessy", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS central science", "PubDate": "2023Jun28"}, {"PMID": "37133746", "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery in children: Distinct T cell responses in MIS-C compared to COVID-19.", "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection for most children results in mild or minimal symptoms, though in rare cases severe disease can develop, including a multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) with myocarditis.

CCHFV is endemic to Asia, the Middle East, South-eastern Europe, and Africa and is transmitted in enzootic cycles among ticks, mammals, and birds. Human infections are mostly subclinical or limited to mild febrile illness. Severe disease may develop, resulting in multi-organ failure, hemorrhagic manifestations, and case-fatality rates up to 30%. Despite the widespread distribution and life-threatening potential, no treatments have been approved for CCHF. Antiviral inhibitory peptides, which antagonize viral entry, are licensed for clinical use in certain viral infections and have been experimentally designed against human pathogenic bunyaviruses, with in vitro and in vivo efficacies. We designed inhibitory peptides against CCHFV with and without conjugation to various polyethylene glycol and sterol groups. These additions have been shown to enhance both cellular uptake and antiviral activity. Peptides were evaluated against pseudotyped and wild-type CCHFV via neutralization tests, Nairovirus fusion assays, and cytotoxicity profiling. Four peptides neutralized CCHFV with two of these peptides shown to inhibit viral fusion.

This puts individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as young infants and immunocompromised individuals, at risk. Therapeutic interventions are complicated by the long incubation time of measles, resulting in a narrow treatment window. At present, the only available WHO-advised option is treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, although this is not approved as standard of care.

The S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein contains the receptor-binding domain and is therefore under selective pressure to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection. In contrast, the S2 subunit of S is only transiently exposed after receptor binding, which makes it a less efficient target for antibodies. As a result, S2 has a lower mutational frequency than S1. We recently described monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV-2 fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides that block viral infection by interfering with S2 conformational rearrangements during viral entry. Importantly, a dimeric lipopeptide was shown to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission between ferrets in vivo. Because the S2 subunit is relatively conserved in newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), we hypothesize that fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides are cross-protective against infection with VOCs. Here, we directly compared the in vitro efficacies of two fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides against VOC, in comparison with a set of seven postvaccination sera (two doses) and a commercial monoclonal antibody preparation. For the beta, delta, and omicron VOCs, it has been reported that convalescent and postvaccination sera are less potent in virus neutralization assays. Both fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides were equally effective against all five VOCs compared to ancestral virus, whereas postvaccination sera and therapeutic monoclonal antibody lost potency to newer VOCs, in particular to omicron BA.1 and BA.2. The neutralizing activity of the lipopeptides is consistent, and they can be expected to neutralize future VOCs based on their mechanism of action. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, continues to spread globally, with waves resulting from new variants that evade immunity generated by vaccines and previous strains and escape available monoclonal antibody therapy.

Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 in Ferrets.", "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) is a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections, with the most severe disease in young infants, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. HPIV-3 infections are currently untreatable with licensed therapeutics, and prophylactic and therapeutic options are needed for patients at risk. To complement existing human airway models of HPIV-3 infection and develop an animal model to assess novel intervention strategies, we evaluated infection and transmission of HPIV-3 in ferrets. A well-characterized human clinical isolate (CI) of HPIV-3 engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP) was passaged on primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) or airway organoids (AO) to avoid tissue culture adaptations. rHPIV3 CI-1-EGFP infection was assessed in vitro in ferret AO and in ferrets in vivo. Undifferentiated and differentiated ferret AO cultures supported rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP replication, but the ferret primary airway cells from AO were less susceptible and permissive than HAE. In vivo rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP replicated in the upper and lower airways of ferrets and targeted respiratory epithelial cells, olfactory epithelial cells, type I pneumocytes, and type II pneumocytes. The infection efficiently induced specific antibody responses. Taken together, ferrets are naturally susceptible to HPIV-3 infection; however, limited replication was observed that led to neither overt clinical signs nor ferret-to-ferret transmission. However, in combination with ferret AO, the ferret model of HPIV-3 infection, tissue tropism, and neutralizing antibodies complements human ex vivo lung models and can be used as a platform for prevention and treatment studies for this important respiratory pathogen. IMPORTANCE HPIV-3 is an important cause of pediatric disease and significantly impacts the elderly. Increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients suffer from HPIV-3 infections, often related to problems with viral clearance. There is a need to model HPIV-3 infections in vitro and in vivo to evaluate novel prophylaxis and treatment options. Currently existing animal models lack the potential for studying animal-to-animal transmission or the effect of immunosuppressive therapy. Here, we describe the use of the ferret model in combination with authentic clinical viruses to further complement human ex vivo models, providing a platform to study approaches to prevent and treat HPIV-3 infection. Although we did not detect ferret-to-ferret transmission in our studies, these studies lay the groundwork for further refinement of the ferret model to immunocompromised ferrets, allowing for studies of severe HPIV-3-associated disease.

We developed a virus neutralization platform strategy that relies only on bioinformatic and genetic information of the virus of interest.

This mutation in F confers an advantage over wild-type virus in the CNS, contributing to disease in these patients. Using murine ex vivo organotypic brain cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids, we show that CNS adaptive mutations in F enhance the spread of virus ex vivo. The spread of virus in human brain organoids is blocked by an inhibitory peptide that targets F, confirming that dissemination in the brain tissue is attributable to F.

In some cases, MeV persistence and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), another severe central nervous system (CNS) complication, develop even in the face of a systemic immune response. Both MIBE and SSPE are relatively rare but lethal. It is unclear how MeV causes CNS infection. We introduced specific mutations that are found in MIBE or SSPE cases into the MeV fusion protein to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of the viral fusion complex-comprising F and the receptor binding protein, H-allows virus to spread in the CNS. Using metagenomic, structural, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that altered fusion properties of the MeV H-F fusion complex permit MeV to spread in brain tissue.", "Keywords": ["central

children worldwide are in large part caused by the parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), particularly HPIV3, along with human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses. There are no vaccines for these important human pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or no efficacy. Infection by HPIV is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. A viral fusion protein (F), once activated in proximity to a target cell, undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the trimer subunits to allow insertion of the hydrophobic domains into the target cell membrane and then refold the trimer into a stable postfusion state, driving the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Clinical application of this strategy, however, requires improving the in vivo stability of antiviral peptides. We show that the HRC peptide backbone can be modified via partial replacement of \u03b1-amino acid residues with \u03b2-amino acid residues to generate \u03b1/\u03b2-peptides that retain antiviral activity but are poor protease substrates. Relative to a conventional \u03b1-lipopeptide, our best \u03b1/\u03b2-lipopeptide exhibits improved persistence in vivo and improved anti-HPIV3 antiviral activity in animals.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acids", "Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Cell Line", "Cholesterol", "Drug Design", "Humans", "Lipopeptides", "Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human", "Protein Multimerization", "Rats", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Tissue Distribution", "Transition Temperature", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Victor K", "Last Name": "Outlaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ross W", "Last Name": "Cheloha", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eric M", "Last Name": "Jurgens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Francesca T", "Last Name": "Bovier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dale F", "Last Name": "Kreitler", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}, {"First Name": "Olivia", "Last Name": "Harder", "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Niewiesk", "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Porotto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel H", "Last Name": "Gellman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Moscona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2021Apr21"}, {"PMID": "33649566", "Title": "The in vitro multilineage differentiation and maturation of lung and airway cells from human pluripotent stem cell-derived lung progenitors in 3D.", "Abstract": "Lung and airway epithelial cells generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have applications in regenerative medicine, modeling of lung disease, drug screening and studies of human lung development.

Peptide Derived from the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein HRC Domain.", "Abstract": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has erupted into a global pandemic that has led to tens of millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The development of therapeutics to treat infection or as prophylactics to halt viral transmission and spread is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 relies on structural rearrangements within a spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we describe the development of a lipopeptide that is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of SARS-CoV-2 S that potently inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2. The lipopeptide inhibits cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S and blocks infection by live SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cell monolayers more effectively than previously described lipopeptides. The SARS-CoV-2 lipopeptide exhibits broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and blocking infection by live MERS-CoV in cell monolayers. We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 HRC-derived lipopeptide potently blocks the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an ex vivo model designed to mimic respiratory viral propagation in humans. While viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was widespread in untreated airways, those treated with SARS-CoV-2 HRC lipopeptide showed no detectable evidence of viral spread. These data provide a framework for the development of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, continues to spread globally, placing strain on health care systems and resulting in rapidly increasing numbers of cases and mortalities. Despite the growing need for medical intervention, no FDA-approved vaccines are yet available, and treatment has been limited to supportive therapy for the alleviation of symptoms.

HPIV3 is a member of the Respirovirus species of the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with genomes composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. During viral entry, the first step of infection, the viral fusion complex, comprised of the receptor-binding glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), mediates fusion upon receptor binding. The HPIV3 transmembrane protein HN, like the receptor-binding proteins of other related viruses that enter host cells using membrane fusion, binds to a receptor molecule on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers the F glycoprotein to undergo major conformational rearrangements, promoting viral entry. Subsequent fusion of the viral and host membranes allows delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The intermediate states in viral entry are transient and thermodynamically unstable, making it impossible to understand these transitions using standard methods, yet understanding these transition states is important for expanding our knowledge of the viral entry process. In this study, we use cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to dissect the stepwise process by which the receptor-binding protein triggers F-mediated fusion, when forming a complex with receptor-bearing membranes. Using an on-grid antibody capture method that facilitates examination of fresh, biologically active strains of virus directly from supernatant fluids and a series of biological tools that permit the capture of intermediate states in the fusion process, we visualize the series of events that occur when a pristine, authentic viral particle interacts with target receptors and proceeds from the viral entry steps of receptor engagement to membrane fusion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "HN Protein", "Humans", "Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human", "Vero Cells", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tara C", "Last Name": "Marcink", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amedee", "Last Name": "des Georges", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Porotto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Moscona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32898168", "Title": "In vivo antiviral host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age.", "Abstract": "Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations.

The mutation dysregulated the viral fusion machinery so that the mutated F protein mediated cell fusion in the absence of known MeV cellular receptors. While this virus could feasibly have arisen via intrahost evolution of the wild-type (wt) virus, it was recently shown that the same mutation emerged under the selective pressure of small-molecule antiviral treatment. Under these conditions, a potentially neuropathogenic variant emerged outside the CNS. While CNS adaptation of MeV was thought to generate viruses that are less fit for interhost spread, we show that two animal models can be readily infected with CNS-adapted MeV via the respiratory route. Despite bearing a fusion protein that is less stable at 37\u00b0C than the wt MeV F, this virus infects and replicates in cotton rat lung tissue more efficiently than the wt virus and is lethal in a suckling mouse model of MeV encephalitis even with a lower inoculum. Thus, either during lethal MeV CNS infection or during antiviral treatment in vitro, neuropathogenic MeV can emerge, can infect new hosts via the respiratory route, and is more pathogenic (at least in these animal models) than wt MeV.IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) infection can be severe in immunocompromised individuals and lead to complications, including measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE).

Years later, children are presenting with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). To investigate the features of established MeV neuronal infections, viral sequences were analyzed from brain tissue samples of a single SSPE case and compared with MIBE sequences previously obtained from patients infected during the same epidemic. Both the SSPE and the MIBE viruses had amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of the F protein that confer enhanced fusion properties. Functional analysis of the fusion complexes confirmed that both MIBE and SSPE F protein mutations promoted fusion with less dependence on interaction by the viral receptor-binding protein with known MeV receptors. While the SSPE F required the presence of a homotypic attachment protein, MeV H, in order to fuse, MIBE F did not. Both F proteins had decreased thermal stability compared to that of the corresponding wild-type F protein. Finally, recombinant viruses expressing MIBE or SSPE fusion complexes spread in the absence of known MeV receptors, with MIBE F-bearing viruses causing large syncytia in these cells. Our results suggest that alterations to the MeV fusion complex that promote fusion and cell-to-cell spread in the absence of known MeV receptors is a key property for infection of the brain.IMPORTANCE Measles virus can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause severe neurological complications, such as MIBE and SSPE. However, mechanisms by which MeV enters the CNS and triggers the disease remain unclear. We analyzed viruses from brain tissue of individuals with MIBE or SSPE, infected during the same epidemic, after the onset of neurological disease. Our findings indicate that the emergence of hyperfusogenic MeV F proteins is associated with infection of the brain.

To improve efficacy of such entry inhibitors, we have modified a HRC peptide inhibitor by introducing properties of self-assembly into nanoparticles (NP) and higher affinity for both viral and cell membranes.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins-the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN's dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4\u00a0days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.IMPORTANCE Human parainfluenza virus 3 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Using deep genomic sequencing of HPIV-3-positive clinical material and its subsequent viral isolate, we discover a number of known and novel coding mutations in the main HPIV-3 attachment protein HN during brief exposure to immortalized cells. These mutations significantly alter function of the fusion complex, increasing fusion promotion by HN as well as generally decreasing neuraminidase activity and increasing HN-receptor engagement.

Our findings are consistent with a general mechanism of paramyxovirus fusion activation in which the stalk domain of the receptor binding protein is responsible for F activation and a specific connecting region between the receptor binding globular head and the fusion-activating stalk domain is required for transmitting the fusion signal.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Humans", "Newcastle disease virus", "Nipah Virus", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Recombinant Proteins", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aparna", "Last Name": "Talekar", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Ilaria", "Last Name": "DeVito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zuhair", "Last Name": "Salah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samantha G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anasuya", "Last Name": "Chattopadhyay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John K", "Last Name": "Rose", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian A", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Moscona", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Porotto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}]
