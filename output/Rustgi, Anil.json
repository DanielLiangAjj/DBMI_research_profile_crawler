Notably, the Keto diet-induced tumor metastasis is dependent on BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) and its up-regulation of pro-metastatic targets, including cell migration-inducing hyaluronidase 1, in response to the Keto diet. By contrast, upon genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous BACH1, the Keto diet-mediated activation of those targets is largely diminished, and the effects on tumor metastasis are completely abolished. Mechanistically, upon administration of the Keto diet, the levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) are markedly induced. Through direct interaction with BACH1, ATF4 is recruited to those pro-metastatic target promoters and enhances BACH1-mediated transcriptional activation. Together, these data implicate a distinct transcription regulatory program of BACH1 for tumor metastasis induced by the Keto diet. Our study also raises a potential health risk of the Keto diet in human patients with cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Diet, Ketogenic", "Animals", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Mice", "Humans", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Transcription, Genetic", "Disease Models, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhenyi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhangchuan", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2024Jun07"}, {"PMID": "38741711", "Title": "Tumor niche network-defined subtypes predict immunotherapy response of esophageal squamous cell cancer.", "Abstract": "Despite the promising outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), resistance to ICI presents a new challenge.

Mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ plays critical roles in mitochondrial bioenergetics by impinging upon respiration, energy production and flux of biochemical intermediates through the TCA cycle. Inhibition of MCU in oncogenic cell lines results in an energetic crisis and reduced cell proliferation unless media is supplemented with nucleosides, pyruvate or \u03b1-KG. Nevertheless, the roles of MCU-mediated Ca2+ influx in cancer cells remain unclear, in part because of a lack of genetic models. Methods: MCU was genetically deleted in transformed murine fibroblasts for study in vitro and in vivo. Tumor formation and growth were studied in murine xenograft models. Proliferation, cell invasion, spheroid formation and cell cycle progression were measured in vitro. The effects of MCU deletion on survival and cell-death were determined by probing for live/death markers. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were studied by measuring mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentration, membrane potential, global dehydrogenase activity, respiration, ROS production and inactivating-phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The effects of MCU rescue on metabolism were examined by tracing of glucose and glutamine utilization for fueling of mitochondrial respiration. Results: Transformation of primary fibroblasts in vitro was associated with increased MCU expression, enhanced MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake, altered mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentration responses to agonist stimulation, suppression of inactivating-phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and a modest increase of mitochondrial respiration. Genetic MCU deletion inhibited growth of HEK293T cells and transformed fibroblasts in mouse xenograft models, associated with reduced proliferation and delayed cell-cycle progression. MCU deletion inhibited cancer stem cell-like spheroid formation and cell invasion in vitro, both predictors of metastatic potential. Surprisingly, mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+], membrane potential, global dehydrogenase activity, respiration and ROS production were unaffected. In contrast, MCU deletion elevated glycolysis and glutaminolysis, strongly sensitized cell proliferation to glucose and glutamine limitation, and altered agonist-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals. Conclusion: Our results reveal a dependence of tumorigenesis on MCU, mediated by a reliance on MCU for cell metabolism and Ca2+ dynamics necessary for cell-cycle progression and cell proliferation.", "Keywords": ["calcium", "cancer", "metabolism", "mitochondria", "stable isotope tracing", "uniporter"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Fernandez Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Usha", "Last Name": "Paudel", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Noji", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Caitlyn E", "Last Name": "Bowman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jason R", "Last Name": "Pitarresi", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Wellen", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zolt", "Last Name": "Arany", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jillian S", "Last Name": "Weissenrieder", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "J Kevin", "Last Name": "Foskett", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37318881", "Title": "LIN28B promotes cell invasion and colorectal cancer metastasis via CLDN1 and NOTCH3.", "Abstract": "The RNA-binding protein LIN28B is overexpressed in over 30% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis.

Using human CRC cells (DLD-1, Caco-2, and LoVo) with either knockdown or overexpression of LIN28B, we identified claudin 1 (CLDN1) tight junction protein as a direct downstream target and effector of LIN28B. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that LIN28B directly binds to and posttranscriptionally regulates CLDN1 mRNA. Furthermore, using in vitro assays and a potentially novel murine model of metastatic CRC, we show that LIN28B-mediated CLDN1 expression enhances collective invasion, cell migration, and metastatic liver tumor formation. Bulk RNA sequencing of the metastatic liver tumors identified NOTCH3 as a downstream effector of the LIN28B/CLDN1 axis. Additionally, genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of NOTCH3 signaling revealed that NOTCH3 was necessary for invasion and metastatic liver tumor formation.

Through unbiased cytokine arrays, we have identified CC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) as a secreted factor that is increased upon co-culture of ESCC cells and CAFs, which we replicated in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) with CAFs. Loss of tumor-cell-derived CCL5 reduces ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and we propose this is mediated, in part, by a reduction in ERK1/2 signaling. Loss of tumor-derived CCL5 reduces the percentage of CAFs recruited to xenograft tumors in vivo. CCL5 is a ligand for the CC motif receptor 5 (CCR5), for which a clinically approved inhibitor exists, namely Maraviroc.

Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments. We demonstrate how to generate 3D organoids from normal, preneoplastic, and SCC murine esophageal tissue and maintain and cryopreserve these organoids. The applications of these versatile organoids are broad and include the utilization of genetically engineered mice and further characterization by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, the generation of isogeneic organoid lines using CRISPR technologies, and drug screening or syngeneic transplantation. We believe that the widespread adoption of the techniques demonstrated in this protocol will accelerate progress in this field to combat the severe burden of ESCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Organoids", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Norihiro", "Last Name": "Matsuura", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Masataka", "Last Name": "Shimonosono", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Yasuto", "Last Name": "Tomita", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Masaki", "Last Name": "Morimoto", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Ogoegbunam", "Last Name": "Okolo", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Victoria X", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Anuraag S", "Last Name": "Parikh", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Andres J P", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Histopathology Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center."}, {"First Name": "Kelley", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Joel T", "Last Name": "Gabre", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Section of Oral, Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University; hn2360@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2022Dec23"}, {"PMID": "36525973", "Title": "KMT2D deficiency drives lung squamous cell carcinoma and hypersensitivity to RTK-RAS inhibition.", "Abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) represents a major subtype of lung cancer with limited treatment options.

Kmt2d loss increases activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), EGFR and ERBB2, partly through reprogramming the chromatin landscape to repress the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatases.

Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) catalyzes monooxygenation of cholesterol into 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is implicated in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and in cholesterol depletion. Here, we show that, within PDAC cells, accumulation of cholesterol was facilitated by the loss of CH25H. Methylation of the CH25H gene and decreased levels of CH25H expression occurred in human pancreatic cancers and was associated with poor prognosis. Knockout of Ch25h in mice accelerated progression of Kras-driven pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Conversely, restoration of CH25H expression in human and mouse PDAC cells decreased their viability under conditions of cholesterol deficit, and decelerated tumor growth in immune competent hosts.

Abnormal cytoplasmic enrichment observed in solid tumors often correlates with poor clinical outcome. The mechanism of cytoplasmic redistribution and ensuing functional role of cytoplasmic hnRNPK remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the SCFFbxo4 E3 ubiquitin ligase restricts the pro-oncogenic activity of hnRNPK via K63 linked polyubiquitylation, thus limiting its ability to bind target mRNA. We identify SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK responsive mRNAs whose products regulate cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and invasion. Loss of SCFFbxo4 leads to enhanced cell invasion, migration, and tumor metastasis. C-Myc was identified as one target of SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK. Fbxo4 loss triggers hnRNPK-dependent increase in c-Myc translation, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Increased c-Myc positions SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK dysregulated cancers for potential therapeutic interventions that target c-Myc-dependence.

plasticity1,2, the origin and magnitude of cell-state diversity remains poorly understood. Equally, it is unclear whether growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. Here, by combining mouse genetics, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying the cell-fate specification and differentiation of the embryonic neural crest. We show that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche, a phenotype acquired through an intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of cells are fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells with a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitute a pool of metastatic\u00a0initiating cells that switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of melanoma cell states and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of cells. The observation that these phenotypic competencies can be dynamically acquired after exposure to specific niche signals warrant the development of therapeutic strategies that interfere with the cancer

Endoscopic biopsies of treatment-naive patients at a single tertiary care center were used to generate esophageal cancer PDOs, which were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy, gamma-irradiation, and newer non-standard approaches, such as proton beam therapy or two small molecule inhibitors. Clinical outcomes of patients following neoadjuvant treatment were compared to their in vitro PDO responses, demonstrating the PDO's ability to mirror clinical response, suggesting the value of PDOs in prediction of clinical response to new therapeutic approaches.

BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 variant are at increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet current guidelines recommend surveillance only for those with a family history of PDAC. We aimed to investigate outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-based PDAC surveillance in BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 carriers without a family history of PDAC. We performed a retrospective analysis of all P/LP BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 carriers who underwent EUS at a tertiary care center. Of 194 P/LP BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 carriers who underwent EUS, 64 (33%) had no family history of PDAC and had at least 1 EUS for PDAC surveillance. These individuals underwent 143 total EUSs, were predominantly female (72%), and BRCA2 carriers (73%), with the majority having a personal history of cancer other than PDAC (67%). The median age at time of first EUS was 62 years [interquartile range (IQR), 53-67 years] and a median of 2 EUSs (IQR 1-3) were performed per patient, with a median of 3 years (IQR 2-4.5 years) between the first and last EUS for those with more than 1 EUS. Pancreatic abnormalities were detected in 44%, including cysts in 27%, and incidental luminal abnormalities in 41%. Eight percent developed a new pancreatic mass or cyst during surveillance, 2 individuals developed PDAC, and no serious complications resulted from surveillance. After discussion of the risks, limitations, and potential benefits, PDAC surveillance can be considered in BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 carriers without a family history of PDAC; however, the effectiveness of PDAC surveillance in this population requires further study. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2 carriers have increased pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk, yet are typically not eligible for PDAC surveillance in the absence of PDAC family history.

It is increasingly accepted that carcinoma cells exist along a continuum of hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) states and that cells exhibiting such partial EMT (P-EMT) states have greater metastatic competence than those characterized by either extreme (E or M). We described recently a P-EMT program operating in\u00a0vivo by which carcinoma cells lose their epithelial state through post-translational programs. Here, we investigate the underlying mechanisms and report that prolonged calcium signaling induces a P-EMT characterized by the internalization of membrane-associated E-cadherin (ECAD) and other epithelial proteins as well as an increase in cellular migration and invasion. Signaling through G\u03b1q-associated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recapitulates these effects, which operate through the downstream activation of calmodulin-Camk2b signaling.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC differentiation remain to be elucidated. Herein, we unravel a potentially novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism via a LIN28B/CDX2 signaling axis that plays a critical role in mediating CRC differentiation. Owing to a large number of mRNA targets, the mRNA-binding protein LIN28B has diverse functions in development, metabolism, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Our RNA-binding protein IP (RIP) assay revealed that LIN28B directly binds CDX2 mRNA, which is a pivotal homeobox transcription factor in normal intestinal epithelial cell identity and differentiation. Furthermore, LIN28B overexpression resulted in enhanced CDX2 expression to promote differentiation in subcutaneous xenograft tumors generated from CRC cells and metastatic tumor colonization through mesenchymal-epithelial transition in CRC liver metastasis mouse models. A ChIP sequence for CDX2 identified \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) as a potentially novel transcriptional target of CDX2 in the context of LIN28B overexpression. We also found that AMACR enhanced intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity, which is known as a key component of intestinal differentiation, through the upregulation of butyric acid.

P53R175H (homologous to Trp53R172H in mice) is a common hot spot mutation. How metastasis is regulated by p53R175H in ESCC remains to be investigated. To investigate p53R175H-mediated molecular mechanisms, we used a carcinogen-induced approach in Trp53R172H/- mice to model ESCC. In the primary Trp53R172H/- tumor cell lines, we depleted Trp53R172H (shTrp53) and observed a marked reduction in cell invasion in vitro and lung metastasis burden in a tail-vein injection model in comparing isogenic cells (shCtrl). Furthermore, we performed bulk RNA-seq to compare gene expression profiles of metastatic and primary shCtrl and shTrp53 cells. We identified the YAP-BIRC5 axis as a potential mediator of Trp53R172H -mediated metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of Survivin, an antiapoptotic protein encoded by BIRC5, increases in the presence of Trp53R172H Furthermore, depletion of Survivin specifically decreases Trp53R172H-driven lung metastasis. Mechanistically, Trp53R172H but not wild-type Trp53, binds with YAP in ESCC cells, suggesting their cooperation to induce Survivin expression. Furthermore, Survivin high expression level is associated with increased metastasis in several GI cancers.

As a result, targeted therapies to inhibit metastasis are lacking. Here, we report that the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP encoded by PTHLH) is frequently amplified as part of the KRAS amplicon in patients with pancreatic cancer. PTHrP upregulation drives the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors in mice and is highly enriched in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma metastases. Loss of PTHrP-either genetically or pharmacologically-dramatically reduces tumor burden, eliminates metastasis, and enhances overall survival. These effects are mediated in part through a reduction in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which reduces the ability of tumor cells to initiate metastatic cascade. Spp1, which encodes osteopontin, is revealed to be a downstream effector of PTHrP. Our results establish a new paradigm in pancreatic cancer whereby PTHrP is a driver of disease progression and emerges as a novel therapeutic vulnerability. SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic cancer often presents with metastases, yet no strategies exist to pharmacologically inhibit this process. Herein, we establish the oncogenic and prometastatic roles of PTHLH, a novel amplified gene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We demonstrate that blocking PTHrP activity reduces primary tumor growth, prevents metastasis, and prolongs survival in mice.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1601.",

The most commonly mutated gene in ESCC is TP53. Using a combinatorial genetic and carcinogenic approach, we generate a novel mouse model of ESCC expressing either mutant or null p53 and show that mutant p53 exhibits enhanced tumorigenic properties and displays a distinct genomic profile. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identify several endocytic recycling genes, including Rab Coupling Protein (Rab11-FIP1), which are significantly downregulated in mutant p53 tumor cells. In 3-dimensional (3D) organoid models, genetic knockdown of Rab11-FIP1 results in increased organoid size. Loss of Rab11-FIP1 increases tumor cell invasion in part through mutant p53 but also in an independent manner.

Our study establishes the first well-characterized panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids from HPV+ HNSCCs while determining fidelity of the models to the distinguishing genetic features of this cancer type. Despite low engraftment rates, whole exome sequencing showed that PDXs retain multiple distinguishing features of HPV+ HNSCC lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion and the absence of EGFR amplifications. Engrafted HPV+ tumors frequently contained NOTCH1 mutations, thus providing new models for a negatively prognostic alteration in this disease. Genotype-phenotype associations in the models were then tested for prediction of tumor progression and survival in published clinical cohorts. Observation of high tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) in the faster-growing models facilitated identification of a novel association between TMB and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV- patients that was prognostic in HPV- cases. In addition, reduced E7 and p16INK4A levels found in a PDX from an outlier case with lethal outcome led to detection of similar profiles among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs. Transcriptional data from the Cancer Genome Atlas was used to demonstrate that the lower E2F target gene expression predicted by reduced E7 levels has potential as a biomarker of disease recurrence risk. Our findings bridge a critical gap in preclinical models for HPV+ HNSCCs and simultaneously reveal novel potential applications of quantifying mutational burden and viral oncogene functions for biomarker development.", "Keywords": ["HPV", "biomarkers", "head and neck cancer", "outcomes", "patient-derived xenografts"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "ErbB Receptors", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus E7 Proteins", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Patient-Specific Modeling", "Prognosis", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Survival Analysis", "TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole D", "Last Name": "Facompre", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavithra", "Last Name": "Rajagopalan", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Varun", "Last Name": "Sahu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander T", "Last Name": "Pearson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen T", "Last Name": "Montone", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claire D", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frederico O", "Last Name": "Gleber-Netto", "Affiliation": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery, The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory S", "Last Name": "Weinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jalal", "Last Name": "Jalaly", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Curtis R", "Last Name": "Pickering", "Affiliation": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery, The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bradford E", "Last Name": "Windle", "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iain M", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger B", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis A", "Last Name": "Gimotty", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Devraj", "Last Name": "Basu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of cancer", "PubDate": "2020Dec01"}, {"PMID": "32364115", "Title": "Our New President-M.

Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests compared variables among patients based on the study outcome of whether a GI-CREP appointment was completed; marginal standardization was used to predict the standardized percentage of patients that had appointment completion. A total of 676 patients had a scheduled GI-CREP appointment; 32 individuals were excluded due to incomplete information or scheduling error, resulting in 644 patients available for final analysis. Our study population was predominantly female (61%), White (77%), and married (64%), had private healthcare insurance (76%), and lacked a personal history of cancer (60%). Referrals internal to the healthcare system were most common (77%), with gastroenterologists as the most frequent referring provider (42%). Seventy-five percent of scheduled individuals had appointment completion, while 25% of individuals did not. Independent predictors for an incomplete GI-CREP appointment included Medicaid insurance (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.21-4.28, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01), self-identified Black race (OR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.20-3.25, p\u00a0=\u00a0.008), and personal history of cancer (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.11-2.31, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). These data highlight existing disparities in GIC risk assessment appointment completion associated with race, health insurance coverage, and medical status. Further studies of these areas are necessary to ensure equitable access to important GIC risk assessment services.", "Keywords": ["access", "disparities", "gastrointestinal cancer", "genetics

gene.", "Abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is a lethal malignancy that is familial or associated with genetic syndromes in 10% of cases. Gene-based surveillance strategies for at-risk individuals may improve clinical outcomes. However, familial PC (FPC) is plagued by genetic heterogeneity and the genetic basis for the majority of FPC remains elusive, hampering the development of gene-based surveillance programs. The study was powered to identify genes with a cumulative pathogenic variant prevalence of at least 3%, which includes the most prevalent PC susceptibility gene, BRCA2. Since the majority of known PC susceptibility genes are involved in DNA repair, we focused on genes implicated in these pathways. We performed a region-based association study using the Mixed-Effects Score Test, followed by leave-one-out characterization of PC-associated gene regions and variants to identify the genes and variants driving risk associations. We evaluated 398 cases from two case series and 987 controls without a personal history of cancer. The first case series consisted of 109 patients with either FPC (n = 101) or PC at \u226450 years of age (n = 8). The second case series was composed of 289 unselected PC cases. We validated this discovery strategy by identifying known pathogenic BRCA2 variants, and also identified SMG1, encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase, to be significantly associated with PC following correction for multiple testing (p = 3.22x10-7). The SMG1 association was validated in a second independent series of 532 FPC cases and 753 controls (p<0.0062, OR = 1.88, 95%CI 1.17-3.03). We showed segregation of the c.4249A>G SMG1 variant in 3 affected relatives in a FPC kindred, and we found c.103G>A to be a recurrent SMG1 variant associating with PC in both the discovery and validation series. These results suggest that SMG1 is a novel PC susceptibility gene, and we identified specific SMG1 gene variants associated with PC risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Adult",

BE progresses through low- and high-grade dysplasia before developing into esophageal adenocarcinoma. The BE microenvironment is not well defined. We compare 12 human clinical BE and adjacent normal squamous epithelium biopsies using single cell immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. A cassette of 19 epithelial and immune cell markers was used to detect differences between cellular compartments in normal and BE tissues. We found that the BE microenvironment has an immunological landscape distinct from adjacent normal epithelium. BE has an increased percentage of epithelial cells with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of immune cells, accompanied by a shift in the immune landscape from a predominantly T cell rich microenvironment in normal tissue to a B cell rich landscape in BE tissue. Hierarchical clustering separates BE and normal samples into two discrete groups based upon our 19-marker panel, but also reveals unexpected, shared phenotypes for three patients. Our results suggest that flow based single cell analysis may have the potential for revealing clinically relevant differences between BE and normal adjacent tissue, and that surface immunophenotypes

The PRRX1 isoforms have been demonstrated to be important in pancreatic cancer, especially in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in liver metastasis. In order to determine the functional underpinnings of PRRX1 and its isoforms, we have unraveled a new interplay between PRRX1 and the FOXM1 transcriptional factors. Our detailed biochemical analysis reveals the direct physical interaction between PRRX1 and FOXM1 proteins that requires the PRRX1A/B 200-222/217 amino acid (aa) region and the FOXM1 Forkhead domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the cooperation between PRRX1 and FOXM1 in the regulation of FOXM1-dependent transcriptional activity. Moreover, we establish FOXM1 as a critical downstream target of PRRX1 in pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate a novel role for PRRX1 in the regulation of genes involved in DNA repair pathways. Indeed, we show that expression of PRRX1 isoforms may limit the induction of DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that targeting FOXM1 with the small molecule inhibitor FDI6 suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induces their apoptotic cell death. FDI6 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to Etoposide and Gemcitabine induced apoptosis.

We therefore examined the consequences of disrupting paracrine Hedgehog (HH) signaling in PDAC stroma. Herein, we show that ablation of the key HH signaling gene Smoothened (Smo) in stromal fibroblasts led to increased proliferation of pancreatic tumor cells. Furthermore, Smo deletion resulted in proteasomal degradation of the tumor suppressor PTEN and activation of oncogenic protein kinase B (AKT) in fibroblasts. An unbiased proteomic screen identified RNF5 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in Smo-null fibroblasts. Ring Finger Protein 5 (Rnf5) knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK\u03b2), the kinase that marks PTEN for ubiquitination, rescued PTEN levels and reversed the oncogenic phenotype, identifying a new node of PTEN regulation. In PDAC patients, low stromal PTEN correlated with reduced overall survival.

IMP1 is regulated by let-7 microRNA, which binds in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the transcript. The availability of binding sites is in part controlled by alternative polyadenylation, which determines 3' UTR length. Expression of the short 3' UTR transcript (lacking all microRNA sites) results in higher protein levels and is correlated with increased proliferation. We used in vitro and in vivo model systems to test the hypothesis that the short 3' UTR isoform of IMP1 promotes CRC metastasis. Herein we demonstrate that 3' UTR shortening increases IMP1 protein expression and that this in turn enhances the metastatic burden to the liver, whereas expression of the long isoform (full length 3' UTR) does not. Increased tumor burden results from elevated tumor surface area driven by cell proliferation and cell survival mechanisms. These processes are independent of classical apoptosis pathways. Moreover, we demonstrate the shifts toward the short isoform are associated with metastasis in patient populations where IMP1-long expression predominates. Overall, our work demonstrates that different IMP1 expression levels result in different functional outcomes in CRC metastasis and that targeting IMP1 may reduce tumor progression in some patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Liver Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah F", "Last Name": "Andres", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathy N", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline B", "Last Name": "Plesset", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey J", "Last Name": "Headd", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rei", "Last Name": "Mizuno", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priya", "Last Name": "Chatterji", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley A", "Last Name": "Lento", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andres J", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rosemarie", "Last Name": "Mick", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "Journal": "Carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2019Jun10"}, {"PMID": "30332430", "Title": "Effects of exercise on circulating tumor cells among patients with resected stage I-III colon cancer.", "Abstract": "Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence among colon cancer patients.

In this study, using Cyp1b1-/-, Cyp1a1/1a2-/-, and Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1-/- mice, we observed that cigarette and environmental toxins, namely benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), induce pancreatic mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and pancreatitis. Our results suggest that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and resultant mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with pancreatic pathology. BaP treatment markedly inhibits pancreatic mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ADP-dependent OCR, and also maximal respiration, in wild-type mice but not in Cyp1a1/1a2-/- and Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1-/- mice. In addition, both BaP and TCDD treatment markedly affected mitochondrial complex IV activity, in addition to causing marked reduction in mitochondrial DNA content. Interestingly, the AhR antagonist resveratrol, attenuated BaP-induced mitochondrial respiratory defects in the pancreas, and reversed pancreatitis, both histologically and biochemically in wild-type mice. These results reveal a novel role for AhR- and AhR-regulated CYP1 enzymes in eliciting mitochondrial dysfunction and cigarette toxin-mediated pancreatic pathology. We propose that increased mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon associated pancreatitis.

present in approximately 30% of human lung adenocarcinomas. Although recent advances in targeted therapy have shown great promise, effective targeting of KRAS remains elusive, and concurrent alterations in tumor suppressors render KRAS-mutant tumors even more resistant to existing therapies. Contributing to the refractoriness of KRAS-mutant tumors are immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as increased presence of suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumors and elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells. Treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors is beneficial for hematologic malignancies, and they have Treg-disruptive effects in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model. Targeting PD-1-inhibitory signals through PD-1 antibody blockade also has substantial therapeutic impact in lung cancer, although these outcomes are limited to a minority of patients. We hypothesized that the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 would synergize with PD-1 blockade to promote a robust antitumor response in lung cancer. In the present study, using Kras+/LSL-G12D ; Trp53L/L (KP) mouse models of NSCLC, we identified cooperative effects between JQ1 and PD-1 antibody. The numbers of tumor-infiltrating Tregs were reduced and activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which had a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine profile, was enhanced, underlying their improved effector function. Furthermore, lung tumor-bearing mice treated with this combination showed robust and long-lasting antitumor responses compared with either agent alone, culminating in substantial improvement in the overall survival of treated mice. Thus, combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade offers a promising therapeutic approach for solid malignancies such as lung adenocarcinoma.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are an essential component of the TME, contributing to tumorigenesis by secreting growth factors, modifying the extracellular matrix, supporting angiogenesis, and suppressing antitumor immune responses. Through an unbiased approach, we have established that IL-6 mediates cross-talk between tumor cells and CAF not only by supporting tumor cell growth, but also by promoting fibroblast activation. As a result, IL-6 receptor (IL6R\u03b1) and downstream effectors offer opportunities for targeted therapy in upper-GI cancers. IL-6 loss suppressed tumorigenesis in physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) organotypic and 3D tumoroid models and murine models of esophageal cancer. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6R\u03b1 antibody, suppressed tumor growth in vivo in part via inhibition of STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling. Analysis of a pan-cancer TCGA dataset revealed an inverse correlation between IL-6 and IL6R\u03b1 overexpression and patient survival. Therefore, we expanded evaluation of tocilizumab to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient-derived xenografts and gastric adenocarcinoma xenografts, demonstrating suppression of tumor growth and altered STAT3 and ERK1/2 gene signatures. We used small-molecule inhibitors of STAT3 and MEK1/2 signaling to suppress tumorigenesis in the 3D organotypic model of esophageal cancer. We demonstrate that IL6 is a major contributor to the dynamic cross-talk between tumor cells and CAF in the TME. Our findings provide a translational rationale for inhibition of IL6R\u03b1 and downstream signaling pathways as a novel targeted therapy in oral-upper-GI cancers.Significance: These findings demonstrate the interaction of esophageal cancer and cancer-associated fibroblasts through IL-6 signaling, providing rationale for a novel therapeutic approach to target these cancers.

Here we explore a secondary means of KRAS activation in cancer: focal high-level amplification of the KRAS gene in the absence of coding mutations. These amplifications occur most commonly in esophageal, gastric and ovarian adenocarcinomas2-4. KRAS-amplified gastric cancer models show marked overexpression of the KRAS protein and are insensitive to MAPK blockade owing to their capacity to adaptively respond by rapidly increasing KRAS-GTP levels. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the guanine-exchange factors SOS1 and SOS2 or the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 can attenuate this adaptive process and that targeting these factors, both genetically and pharmacologically, can enhance the sensitivity of KRAS-amplified models to MEK inhibition in both in vitro and in vivo settings. These data demonstrate the relevance of copy-number amplification as a mechanism of KRAS activation, and uncover the therapeutic potential for targeting of these tumors through combined SHP2 and MEK

proliferative and consists of crypt invaginations that house stem cells and villus projections with differentiated cells. There exists a dynamic equilibrium between proliferation, migration, differentiation, and senescence that is regulated by several factors. Among these are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind their targets in a both context dependent and independent manner. RBP-RNA complexes act as rheostats by regulating expression of RNAs both co- and post-transcriptionally. This is important, especially in response to intestinal injury, to fuel regeneration. The manner in which these RBPs function in the intestine and their interactions with other pivotal pathways in colorectal cancer may provide a framework for new insights and potential therapeutic applications.", "Keywords": ["CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 1 (CELF1)", "LIN28", "MEX3A", "Musashi (MSI)", "RNA binding protein 3 (RBM3) and Hu-Antigen R (HUR)", "RNA binding proteins", "colorectal cancer", "insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding proteins (IGF2BP/IMP)", "intestinal stem cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Protein Binding", "RNA", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Priya", "Last Name": "Chatterji", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

However, the utility of emerging JARID1 family inhibitors remains uncertain, in part because JARID1B's functions in normal development and malignancy are diverse and highly context-specific. In this study, responses of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) to catalytic inhibition of JARID1B were assessed using CPI-455, the first tool compound with true JARID1 family selectivity. CPI-455 attenuated clonal sphere and tumor formation by stem-like cells that highly express JARID1B while also depleting the CD44-positive and Aldefluor-high fractions conventionally used to designate OSCC stem cells. Silencing JARID1B abrogated CPI-455's effects on sphere formation, supporting that the drug acted through this isoform. To further delineate CPI-455's capacity to block JARID1B's functions, its biologic effects were compared against those indicated by pathway analysis of the transcriptional profile produced by JARID1B knockdown. Downregulation of multiple gene sets related to stem cell function was consistent with the drug's observed actions. However, strong E-Cadherin upregulation seen upon silencing JARID1B surprisingly could not be reproduced using CPI-455. Expressing a demethylase-inactive mutant of JARID1B demonstrated suppression of this transcript to be demethylase-independent, and the capacity of mutant JARID1B but not CPI-455 to modulate invasion provided a functional correlate of this finding. These results show that JARID1B catalytic inhibition effectively targets some stem cell-like features of malignancy but also reveal demethylase-independent actions refractory to inhibition.

LIN28B has two isoforms: the LIN28B-long and -short isoforms. Although studies have revealed the functions of the LIN28B-long isoform in tumorigenesis, the role of the LIN28B-short isoform remains unclear and represents a major gap in the field. The LIN28B-long and -short isoforms are expressed in a subset of human colorectal cancers and adjacent normal colonic mucosa, respectively. To elucidate the functional and mechanistic aspects of these isoforms, colorectal cancer cells (Caco-2 and LoVo) were generated to either express no LIN28B or the -short or -long isoform. Interestingly, the long isoform suppressed LET-7 expression and activated canonical RAS/ERK signaling, whereas the short isoform did not. The LIN28B-long isoform-expressing cells demonstrated increased drug resistance to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin through the upregulation of ERCC1, a DNA repair gene, in a LET-7-dependent manner. The LIN28B-short isoform preserved its ability to bind pre-let-7, without inhibiting the maturation of LET-7, and competed with the LIN28B-long isoform for binding to pre-let-7 Coexpression of the short isoform in the LIN28B-long isoform-expressing cells rescued the phenotypes induced by the LIN28B-long isoform.Implications: This study demonstrates the differential antagonistic functions of the LIN28B-short isoform against the LIN28B-long isoform through an inability to degrade LET-7, which leads to the novel premise that the short isoform may serve to counterbalance the long isoform during normal colonic epithelial homeostasis, but its downregulation during colonic carcinogenesis may reveal the protumorigenic effects of the long isoform.

Here, we demonstrate that Notch1 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are coupled to promote SCC tumor initiation in concert with transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 present in the tumor microenvironment. We find that TGF\u03b2 activates the transcription factor ZEB1 to repress Notch3, thereby limiting terminal differentiation. Concurrently, TGF\u03b2 drives Notch1-mediated EMT to generate tumor initiating cells characterized by high CD44 expression.

However, there remains a dearth of data regarding molecular profiles that are shared across tissues, an understanding of which could lead to the development of highly versatile, broadly applicable therapies. Using data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we performed a transcriptomics-centered analysis on 1494 patient samples, comparing the two major histological subtypes of solid tumors (adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) across organs, with a focus on tissues in which both subtypes arise: esophagus, lung, and uterine cervix. Via principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis, we discovered that histology-driven differences accounted for a greater degree of inherent molecular variation in the tumors than did tissue of origin. We then analyzed differential gene expression, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA expression between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and found 1733 genes, 346 CpG sites, and 42 microRNAs in common between organ sites, indicating specific adenocarcinoma-associated and squamous cell carcinoma-associated molecular patterns that were conserved across tissues. We then identified specific pathways that may be critical to the development of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, including Liver X receptor activation, which was upregulated in adenocarcinomas but downregulated in squamous cell carcinomas, possibly indicating important differences in cancer cell metabolism between these two histological subtypes of cancer.

The instigating agent typically triggers an inflammatory response. The resulting inflammation is a risk factor for the development of esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Research into the pathophysiology of these conditions has been limited by the availability of animal and human model systems. Three-dimensional organotypic tissue culture (OTC) is an innovative three-dimensional multicellular in\u00a0vitro platform that recapitulates normal esophageal epithelial stratification and differentiation. We hypothesized that this platform can be used to model esophagitis to better understand the interactions between immune cells and the esophageal epithelium. We found that human immune cells remain viable and respond to cytokines when cultured under OTC conditions. The acute inflammatory environment induced in the OTC significantly affected the overlying epithelium, inducing a regenerative response marked by increased cell proliferation and epithelial hyperplasia. Moreover, oxidative stress from the acute inflammation induced DNA damage and strand breaks in epithelial cells, which could be reversed by antioxidant treatment. These findings support the importance of immune cell-mediated esophageal injury in esophagitis and confirms the utility of the OTC platform to characterize the underlying molecular events in esophagitis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Line", "Esophagitis", "Esophagus", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Oxidative Stress"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dorottya", "Last Name": "Laczk\u00f3", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; First Department of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "F Bradley", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Nirag", "Last Name": "Jhala", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e1s", "Last Name": "Roszt\u00f3czy", "Affiliation": "First Department of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"First Name": "Gregory G", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly distinct from Krt15- basal cells. Depletion of Krt15-derived cells resulted in decreased proliferation, thereby leading to atrophy of the esophageal epithelium. Further, Krt15+ cells were radioresistant and contributed to esophageal epithelial regeneration following radiation-induced injury.

However, the heterogeneity of these cells and lack of distinct markers hampers the progress in understanding of the biology and clinical importance of these cells. Using partial enrichment of PMN-MDSC with gradient centrifugation we determined that low density PMN-MDSC and high density neutrophils from the same cancer patients had a distinct gene profile. Most prominent changes were observed in the expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Surprisingly, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was one of the most increased regulators and its receptor oxidized LDL receptor 1 OLR1 was one of the most overexpressed genes in PMN-MDSC. Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) encoded by OLR1 was practically undetectable in neutrophils in peripheral blood of healthy donors, whereas 5-15% of total neutrophils in cancer patients and 15-50% of neutrophils in tumor tissues were LOX-1+. In contrast to their LOX-1- counterparts, LOX-1+ neutrophils had gene signature, potent immune suppressive activity, up-regulation of ER stress, and other biochemical characteristics of PMN-MDSC. Moreover, induction of ER stress in neutrophils from healthy donors up-regulated LOX-1 expression and converted these cells to suppressive PMN-MDSC.

Here, we demonstrate lineage switching of KRAS+ lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) through deletion of Lkb1 (Stk11) in autochthonous and transplant models. Chromatin analysis reveals loss of H3K27me3 and gain of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 at squamous lineage genes, including Sox2, \u0394Np63 and Ngfr. SCC lesions have higher levels of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 than the ADC lesions, but there is a clear lack of the essential Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit EED in the SCC lesions.

Immune checkpoint blockade improves survival in a subset of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but robust biomarkers that predict response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors are lacking. Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. METHODS. We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster.

Therapeutic options for systemic disease are limited, in particular due to the heterogeneous events leading to tumor dissemination. Previous studies highlighted an association of the homeodomain transcription factor MEIS1 with a ductal phenotype in pancreatic tissue architecture. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that MEIS1 is expressed in aberrant duct structures of Ela-TGF\u03b1 transgenic mice as well as in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs), primary PDAC, and metastatic disease in Ptf1aCre/+ ;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice. To assess a putative role of MEIS1 in the progression of PDAC, MEIS1 overexpressing pancreatic cancer cell lines were generated by retroviral gene delivery and assessed for proliferation and migration. MEIS1 did not affect proliferation but increased migration in a subset of cell lines tested. Subsequent genome wide expression analysis identified upregulation of the pro-metastatic gene melanoma cell adhesion molecule (Mcam) in migrating cells. Employing DNA-pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays we reveal interaction of MEIS1 with the enhancer-DNA of Mcam and its transcriptional activation to facilitate migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Activation of Mcam through MEIS1 occurs in a cell type dependent fashion, reflecting the different routes that lead to metastasis in vivo. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time a pro-metastatic function of Mcam in pancreatic cancer. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Keywords": ["CD146", "MEIS1", "Mcam", "metastasis", "pancreatic cancer"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD146 Antigen", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "von Burstin", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Friedrich", "Last Name": "Bachhuber", "Affiliation": "II.

Evaluation of oral cancers for such heterogeneity identified two compartments within the CSC pool. One compartment was detected using a reporter for expression of the H3K4me3 demethylase JARID1B to isolate a JARID1B(high) fraction of cells with stem cell-like function. JARID1B(high) cells expressed oral CSC markers including CD44 and ALDH1 and showed increased PI3K pathway activation. They were distinguished from a fraction in a G0-like cell-cycle state characterized by low reactive oxygen species and suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling. G0-like cells lacked conventional CSC markers but were primed to acquire stem cell-like function by upregulating JARID1B, which directly mediated transition to a state expressing known oral CSC markers. The transition was regulated by PI3K signals acting upstream of JARID1B expression, resulting in PI3K inhibition depleting JARID1B(high) cells but expanding the G0-like subset. These findings define a novel developmental relationship between two cell phenotypes that may jointly contribute to CSC maintenance. Expansion of the G0-like subset during targeted depletion of JARID1B(high) cells implicates it as a candidate therapeutic target within the oral CSC pool.

An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is believed to be important for primary tumor progression and dissemination, whereas a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) appears crucial for metastatic colonization. Here, we describe novel roles for both isoforms in the metastatic cascade using complementary in vitro and in vivo models. Prrx1b promotes invasion, tumor dedifferentiation, and EMT. In contrast, Prrx1a stimulates metastatic outgrowth in the liver, tumor differentiation, and MET. We further demonstrate that the switch from Prrx1b to Prrx1a governs EMT plasticity in both mouse models of PDAC and human PDAC. Last, we identify hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) as a novel transcriptional target of Prrx1b. Targeted therapy of HGF in combination with gemcitabine in a preclinical model of PDAC reduces primary tumor volume and eliminates metastatic disease.

CLIP-Seq, with the ability to provide a genome-wide map of protein-RNA interactions, has been increasingly used to decipher RBP-mediated posttranscriptional regulation. Generating highly reliable binding sites from CLIP-Seq requires not only stringent library preparation but also considerable computational efforts. Here we presented a first systematic evaluation of major computational steps for identifying RBP binding sites from CLIP-Seq data, including preprocessing, the choice of control samples, peak normalization, and motif discovery. We found that avoiding PCR amplification artifacts, normalizing to input RNA or mRNAseq, and defining the background model from control samples can reduce the bias introduced by RNA abundance and improve the quality of detected binding sites.

The K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 double transgenic mice had half as many metaplastic nodules as control L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice.

We hypothesized that autophagy may be induced by acid reflux, which causes injury, and inflammation, and therefore, contributes to the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Currently, the role of autophagy in BE and EAC is poorly studied. We quantitatively define autophagy levels in human BE cell lines, a transgenic mouse model of BE, and human BE, and EAC biopsies. Human non-dysplastic BE had the highest basal number of autophagic vesicles (AVs), while AVs were reduced in normal squamous cells and dysplastic BE cells, and nearly absent in EAC. To demonstrate a functional role for autophagy in BE pathogenesis, normal squamous (STR), non-dysplastic BE (CPA), dysplastic BE (CPD), and EAC (OE19) cell lines were exposed to an acid pulse (pH\u20093.5) followed by incubation in the presence or absence of chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. Acid exposure increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in STR and CPA cells. Chloroquine alone had a small impact on intracellular ROS or cell survival. However, combination of chloroquine with the acid pulse resulted in a significant increase in ROS levels at 6\u2009h in STR and CPA cells, and increased cell death in all cell lines. These findings establish increased numbers of AVs in human BE compared to normal squamous or EAC, and suggest that autophagy functions to improve cell survival after acid reflux injury.

Production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase, as well as other suppressive mechanisms, allows MDSCs to suppress T-cell-mediated tumor clearance and foster tumor progression. Using an unbiased global gene expression approach in conditional p120-catenin knockout mice (L2-cre;p120ctn(f/f)), a model of oral-esophageal cancer, we have identified CD38 as playing a vital role in MDSC biology, previously unknown. CD38 belongs to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family and possesses both ectoenzyme and receptor functions. It has been described to function in lymphoid and early myeloid cell differentiation, cell activation, and neutrophil chemotaxis. We find that CD38 expression in MDSCs is evident in other mouse tumor models of esophageal carcinogenesis, and CD38(high) MDSCs are more immature than MDSCs lacking CD38 expression, suggesting a potential role for CD38 in the maturation halt found in MDSC populations. CD38(high) MDSCs also possess a greater capacity to suppress activated T cells, and promote tumor growth to a greater degree than CD38(low) MDSCs, likely as a result of increased iNOS production. In addition, we have identified novel tumor-derived factors, specifically IL6, IGFBP3, and CXCL16, which induce CD38 expression by MDSCs ex vivo.

This ablation of Let-7 triggers the development of intestinal adenocarcinomas concomitant with reduced survival. Analysis of both mouse and human intestinal cancer specimens reveals that stem cell markers were significantly associated with loss of Let-7 miRNA expression, and that a number of Let-7 targets were elevated, including Hmga1 and Hmga2. Functional studies in 3-D enteroids revealed that Hmga2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate many characteristics of Let-7 depletion, namely accelerating cell cycle progression and enhancing a stem cell phenotype.

Previously, we identified an oncogenic role for the mRNA-binding protein IMP1 (IGF2BP1) in the epithelium during colon tumorigenesis. In the current study, we reveal the contribution of stromal IMP1 in the context of colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis. Interestingly, stromal deletion of Imp1 (Dermo1Cre;Imp1(LoxP/LoxP), or Imp1(\u0394Mes)) in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colitis-associated cancer resulted in increased tumor numbers of larger size and more advanced histologic grade than controls. In addition, Imp1(\u0394Mes) mice exhibited a global increase in protumorigenic microenvironment factors, including enhanced inflammation and stromal components. Evaluation of purified mesenchyme from AOM/DSS-treated Imp1(\u0394Mes) mice demonstrated an increase in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which has not been associated with regulation via IMP1. Genetic knockdown of Imp1 in human primary fibroblasts confirmed an increase in HGF with Imp1 loss, demonstrating a specific, cell-autonomous role for Imp1 loss to increase HGF expression.

We have performed laser capture microdissection with RNA microarray analysis on the invasive and non-invasive tumor cells of p53(R175H)-overexpressing OTC samples to determine candidate genes facilitating tumor invasion. WNT10A was found to be >4-fold upregulated in the invasive front. Since WNT10A is also prominently upregulated during placode promotion in hair follicle development, a process that requires epithelial cells to thicken and elongate, in order to allow downward growth, we hypothesized that WNT10A may be important in mediating a similar mechanism of tumor cell invasion in ESCC. We have found that WNT10A expression is significantly upregulated in human ESCC, when compared with normal adjacent tissue. Furthermore, high WNT10A expression levels correlate with poor survival. Interestingly, we observe that WNT10A is expressed early in embryogenesis, but is reduced dramatically postnatally. We demonstrate that overexpression of WNT10a promotes migration and invasion, and proliferation of transformed esophageal cells. Lastly, we show that WNT10A overexpression induces a greater CD44(High)/CD24(Low) population, which are putative markers of cancer stem cells, and increases self-renewal capability. Taken together, we propose that WNT10A acts as an oncofetal factor that is highly expressed and may promote proper development of the esophagus. During tumorigenesis, it is aberrantly overexpressed in order to promote ESCC migration and invasion, and may be linked to self-renewal of a subset of ESCC cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Blotting, Western", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagus", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Phenotype", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Wnt Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Apple", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "V\u00e9ronique", "Last Name": "Giroux", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Pier", "Last Name": "T\u00e9treault", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ju-Seog", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and."}, {"First Name": "Andres J", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, Department of Systems Biology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA and Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA anil2@mail.med.upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2015May"}, {"PMID": "25724428", "Title": "Detection of Tumor Suppressor Genes in Cancer Development by a Novel shRNA-Based Method.", "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers with poor survival rates and limited therapeutic options.

Further genetic manipulation was achieved through selective and stable RNAi against the tumor suppressors p16(Ink4a) (CDKN2A) or Trp53 (TP53) using lentiviral gene delivery. Treatment of PDCs with 4OH-tamoxifen increased phosphorylation of ERK downstream of KRAS, and subsequent lentiviral transduction resulted in sustained target gene repression. Double-mutant PDCs were then reintroduced into the pancreata of NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice and monitored for tumor growth. Orthotopic implantation of PDCs carrying the activated Kras(G12D)-allele and shRNA against p16(Ink4a) or Trp53 resulted in tumor growth, metastasis, and reduced survival of NSG mice.

BE is known as a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Currently, the cell of origin for human BE has yet to be clearly identified. Therefore, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the initiation of BE metaplasia. Affymetrix gene expression microarray revealed that BE samples express decreased levels of Notch receptors (NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) and one of the the ligands (JAG1). Furthermore, BE tissue microarray showed decreased expression of NOTCH1 and its downstream target HES1. Therefore, Notch signaling was inhibited in human esophageal epithelial cells by expression of dominant-negative-Mastermind-like (dnMAML), in concert with MYC and CDX1 overexpression. Cell transdifferentiation was then assessed by 3D organotypic culture and evaluation of BE-lineage specific gene expression. Notch inhibition promoted transdifferentiation of esophageal epithelial cells toward columnar-like cells as demonstrated by increased expression of columnar keratins (K8, K18, K19, K20) and glandular mucins (MUC2, MUC3B, MUC5B, MUC17) and decreased expression of squamous keratins (K5, K13, K14). In 3D culture, elongated cells were observed in the basal layer of the epithelium with Notch inhibition. Furthermore, we observed increased expression of KLF4, a potential driver of the changes observed by Notch inhibition. Interestingly, knockdown of KLF4 reversed the effects of Notch inhibition on BE-like metaplasia. Overall, Notch signaling inhibition promotes transdifferentiation of esophageal cells toward BE-like metaplasia in part via upregulation of KLF4.

To investigate the potential reasons for the modest impact of ERBB2-directed therapies, we explored the hypothesis that secondary molecular features of ERBB2-amplified GE adenocarcinomas attenuate the impact of ERBB2 blockade. We analyzed genomic profiles of ERBB2-amplified GE adenocarcinomas and determined that the majority of ERBB2-amplified tumors harbor secondary oncogenic alterations that have the potential to be therapeutically targeted. These secondary events spanned genes involved in cell-cycle regulation as well as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Using ERBB2-amplified cell lines, we demonstrated that secondary oncogenic events could confer resistance to ERBB2-directed therapies. Moreover, this resistance could be overcome by targeting the secondary oncogene in conjunction with ERBB2-directed therapy. EGFR is commonly coamplified with ERBB2, and in the setting of ERBB2 amplification, higher EGFR expression appears to mark tumors with greater sensitivity to dual EGFR/ERBB2 kinase inhibitors.

In this context, accessibility through the lumen using a minimally invasive approach provides a means for repetitive evaluation longitudinally by combining fluorescent endoscopic imaging technology with novel fluorescent nanoparticles that are phagocytized by immune cells in the microenvironment. The agent we developed for imaging is synthesized from Feraheme (ferumoxytol), a Food and Drug Administration-approved monocrystaline dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticle, which we conjugated to a near-infrared fluorochrome, CyAL5.5. We demonstrate a high level of uptake of the fluorescent nanoparticles by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the esophagus and spleen of L2Cre;p120ctnflox/flox mice. These mice develop esophageal dysplasia leading to squamous cell carcinoma; we have previously demonstrated that dysplastic and neoplastic esophageal lesions in these mice have an immune cell infiltration that is dominated by MDSCs. In the L2Cre;p120ctnflox/flox mice, evaluation of the spleen reveals that nearly 80% of CD45+ leukocytes that phagocytized the nanoparticle were CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs.

Acute and chronic inflammations are a common element of many gastrointestinal diseases.

Inflammation in these settings can contribute to acute complaints (pain, bleeding, obstruction, and diarrhea) as well as chronic sequelae including strictures and cancer. Research into the pathophysiology of these conditions has been limited by the availability of primary human tissues or appropriate animal models that attempt to physiologically model the human disease. With the many recent advances in tissue engineering and primary human cell culture systems, it is conceivable that these approaches can be adapted to develop novel human ex vivo systems that incorporate many human cell types to recapitulate in vivo growth and differentiation in inflammatory microphysiological environments. Such an advance in technology would improve our understanding of human disease progression and enhance our ability to test for disease prevention strategies and novel therapeutics.

Using ChIP-seq analysis, we compared SOX2-regulated gene profiles in multiple SCC cell lines to ES cell profiles and determined that SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs. In SCCs, SOX2 preferentially interacts with the transcription factor p63, as opposed to the transcription factor OCT4, which is the preferred SOX2 binding partner in ES cells. SOX2 and p63 exhibited overlapping genomic occupancy at a large number of loci in SCCs; however, coordinate binding of SOX2 and p63 was absent in ES cells. We further demonstrated that SOX2 and p63 jointly regulate gene expression, including the oncogene ETV4, which was essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell survival.

A general outcome resulting from these chronic inflammatory conditions is increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is caused by the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are part of the normal inflammatory response, but are also capable of damaging cellular DNA, protein, and organelles. Damage to DNA can include DNA strand breaks, point mutations due to DNA adducts, as well as alterations in methylation patterns leading to activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors. There are a number of significant long-term consequences associated with chronic oxidative stress, most notably cancer. Infiltrating immune cells and stromal components of tissue including fibroblasts contribute to dynamic changes occurring in tissue related to disease development. Immune cells can potentiate oxidative stress, and fibroblasts have the capacity to contribute to advanced growth and proliferation of the epithelium and any resultant cancers. Disease models for GERD, BE, GVHD, and ulcerative colitis based on three-dimensional human cell and tissue culture systems that recapitulate in vivo growth and differentiation in inflammatory-associated microphysiological environments would enhance our understanding of disease progression and improve our ability to test for disease-prevention strategies. The development of physiologically relevant, human cell-based culture systems is therefore a major focus of our research. These novel models will be of enormous value, allowing us to test hypotheses and advance our understanding of these disorders, and will have a translational impact allowing us to more rapidly develop therapeutic and chemopreventive agents. In summary, this work to develop advanced human cell-based models of inflammatory conditions will greatly improve our ability to study, prevent, and treat GERD, BE, GVHD, and inflammatory bowel disease.

We report that intestine targeted expression of LIN28B causes intestinal hypertrophy, crypt expansion, and Paneth cell loss. Furthermore, LIN28B fosters intestinal polyp and adenocarcinoma formation. To examine potential Let-7-independent functions of LIN28B, we pursued ribonucleoprotein cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) to identify direct RNA targets. This revealed that LIN28B bound a substantial number of mRNAs and modestly augmented protein levels of these target mRNAs in vivo. Conversely, Let-7 had a profound effect; modulation of Let-7 levels via deletion of the mirLet7c2/mirLet7b genes recapitulated effects of Lin28b overexpression. Furthermore, intestine-specific Let-7 expression could reverse hypertrophy and Paneth cell depletion caused by Lin28b. This was independent of effects on insulin-PI3K-mTOR signaling. Our study reveals that Let-7 miRNAs are critical for repressing intestinal tissue growth and promoting Paneth cell differentiation.

EMT produces cellular heterogeneity within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) by creating a phenotypically distinct mesenchymal subpopulation that is resistant to conventional therapies. In this study, we systematically characterized differences in the secretomes of E-cadherin high epithelial-like and E-cadherin low mesenchymal-like subpopulations using unbiased and targeted proteomics. A total 1765 proteins showed significant changes with 177 elevated in the epithelial subpopulation and 173 elevated in the mesenchymal cells. Key nodes in affected networks included NF\u03baB, Akt, and ERK, and most implicated cellular components involved various aspects of the extracellular matrix. In particular, large changes were observed in multiple collagens with most affected collagens at much higher abundance levels in the mesenchymal subpopulation. These cells also exhibited a secretome profile resembling that of cancer-associated fibroblastic cells (CAF). S100A4, a commonly used marker for cancer-associated fibroblastic cells, was elevated more than 20-fold in the mesenchymal cells and this increase was further verified at the transcriptome level. S100A4 is a known mediator of EMT, leading to metastasis and EMT has been proposed as a potential source of cancer-associated fibroblastic cells in solid tumors. S100A4 knockdown by small interfering RNA led to decreased expression, secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2, as verified by quantitative PCR, multiple reaction monitoring and zymography analyses, and reduced invasion in collagen-embedded spheroids. Further confirmation in three-dimensional organotypic reconstructs showed less invasion and advanced differentiation in the S100A4 RNA interference samples. Orthotopic metastasis model, developed to validate the findings in vivo, demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous metastasis and augmented differentiation in the primary tumor in siS100A4 xenografts.

Such infiltrative invasion may be mediated by a mesenchymal-like subpopulation of malignant cells that we have previously shown to arise from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resist epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Here, we show that SCCs with infiltrative, high-risk invasion patterns contain abundant mesenchymal-like cells, which are rare in tumors with low-risk patterns. This cellular heterogeneity was modeled accurately in three-dimensional culture using collagen-embedded SCC spheroids, which revealed distinct invasive fronts created by collective migration of E-cadherin-positive cells versus infiltrative migration of individual mesenchymal-like cells. Because EGFR expression by mesenchymal-like cells was diminished in the spheroid model and in human SCCs, we hypothesized that SCCs shift toward infiltrative invasion mediated by this subpopulation during anti-EGFR therapy. Anti-EGFR treatment of spheroids using erlotinib or cetuximab enhanced infiltrative invasion by targeting collective migration by E-cadherin-positive cells while sparing mesenchymal-like cells; by contrast, spheroid invasion in absence of mesenchymal-like cells was abrogated by erlotinib. Similarly, cetuximab treatment of xenografts containing mesenchymal-like cells created an infiltrative invasive front composed of this subpopulation, whereas no such shift was observed upon treating xenografts lacking these cells. These results implicate mesenchymal-like SCC cells as key mediators of the infiltrative invasion seen in tumors with locally aggressive behavior.

Our previous observations imply that inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) kinase signal pathway reverses a matrix metalloproteinase 1-specific invasive phenotype. Here, we investigated the specific genes downstream of MAPK-ERK2 responsible for the hyperproliferative abilities of human and murine primary ductal epithelial cells (PDCs) within an ECM. Compared with control, DNA synthesis and total cell proliferation was significantly increased in human PDCs harboring the PDAC common p53, Rb/p16(INK4a), and K-Ras (G12D) mutations. Both of these effects were readily reversed following small-molecule inhibition or lentiviral silencing of ERK2. Microarray analysis of PDCs in three-dimensional (3D) culture revealed a unique, MAPK-influenced gene signature downstream of K-Ras (G12D). Unbiased hierarchical analysis permitted filtration of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). Pancreatic cells isolated from Pdx1-Cre; LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)-mutated mice exhibit increased TIMP1 RNA transcription compared to wild-type littermate controls. Analyses of both 3D, in vitro human K-Ras (G12D) PDCs and data mining of publicly annotated human pancreatic data sets correlatively indicate increased levels of TIMP1 RNA. While silencing TIMP1 did not significantly effect PDC proliferation, exogenous addition of human recombinant TIMP1 significantly increased proliferation but only in transformed K-Ras (G12D) PDCs in 3D. Overall, TIMP1 is an upregulated gene product and a proliferative inducer of K-Ras(G12D)-mutated PDCs through the ERK2 signaling pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Butadienes", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Epithelial Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Humans", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1", "Mutation, Missense", "Nitriles", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Pancreatic Ducts", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1", "Transcriptome", "ras Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gregory P", "Last Name": "Botta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology and Genetics Program, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Reichert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mauricio J", "Last Name": "Reginato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steffen", "Last Name": "Heeg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter I", "Last Name": "Lelkes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23499759", "Title": "Recurrence of esophageal intestinal metaplasia after endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation of Barrett's esophagus: results from a US Multicenter Consortium.", "Abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an established treatment for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE).

The effect of cancer cells on stromal cells is well recognized. Increasingly, stromal components, such as endothelial and immune cells, are considered indispensable for cancer progression. The role of desmoplastic stroma, in contrast, is poorly understood. Targeting such cellular components within the tumour is attractive. Recent evidence strongly points towards a dynamic stromal cell participation in cancer progression that impacts patient prognosis. The role of specific desmoplastic stromal cells, such as stellate cells and myofibroblasts in pancreatic, oesophageal and skin cancers, was studied in bio-engineered, physiomimetic organotypic cultures and by regression analysis. For pancreatic cancer, the maximal effect on increasing cancer cell proliferation and invasion, as well as decreasing cancer cell apoptosis, occurs when stromal (pancreatic stellate cells) cells constitute the majority of the cellular population (maximal effect at a stromal cell proportion of 0.66-0.83), accompanied by change in expression of key molecules such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Gene-expression microarrays, across three tumour types, indicate that stromal cells consistently and significantly alter global cancer cell functions such as cell cycle, cell-cell signalling, cell movement, cell death and inflammatory response. However, these changes are mediated through cancer type-specific alteration of expression, with very few common targets across tumour types. As highlighted by these in vitro data, the reciprocal relationship of E-cadherin and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression in cancer cells could be shown, in vivo, to be dependent on the stromal content of human pancreatic cancer. These studies demonstrate that context-specific cancer-stroma crosstalk requires to be precisely defined for effective therapeutic targeting.

For example, acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) occurs during acute pancreatitis and might be viewed as a prelude to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. To elucidate regulatory processes that overlap ductal development, ADM, and the progression of normal cells to PanIN lesions, we undertook a systematic approach to identify the Prrx1 paired homeodomain Prrx1 transcriptional factor as a highly regulated gene in these processes. Prrx1 annotates a subset of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells in Prrx1creER(T2)-IRES-GFP mice. Furthermore, sorted Prrx1(+) cells have the capacity to self-renew and expand during chronic pancreatitis. The two isoforms, Prrx1a and Prrx1b, regulate migration and invasion, respectively, in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, Prrx1b is enriched in circulating pancreatic cells (Pdx1cre;LSL-Kras(G12D/+);p53(fl/+);R26YFP). Intriguingly, the Prrx1b isoform, which is also induced in ADM, binds the Sox9 promoter and positively regulates Sox9 expression.

The activation domain of Elk-1 is important for executing its physiologic functions and contains many phosphorylation sites targeted by various MAP kinases following exposure to cell stressors or mitogenic stimuli. The different combinations of phosphorylated sites allow specificity of cellular responses mediated through redundant signaling pathways activated by distinct stimuli. Through phosphorylation of S383, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating stimuli have been shown to regulate various processes important in carcinogenesis through transcriptional regulation in various cell lines, including proliferation. Phosphorylation at the T417 site (pT417), but not the S383 site, is involved in neuronal apoptosis induced through dendritic signaling mechanisms and associates with neuronal lesions in many Lewy body diseases. This points to distinct roles for these different phosphorylation sites in pathophysiologic pathways. However, the S383 site remains the best characterized in the context of normal function and carcinogenesis in cell lines, and less is known about the biochemistry of other phosphorylation sites, particularly in more biochemically relevant models. Here, we show that Elk-1 pT417 is present in epithelial cell nuclei of various normal and cancer tissues and that the number of pT417-positive cells correlates with differentiation grade of colonic adenocarcinomas.
