As such, myriad biomaterial approaches have been explored to provide biochemical and physical cues that encourage tenogenesis and template aligned matrix deposition in lieu of dysfunctional scar tissue formation. Fiber-reinforced hydrogels present an ideal biomaterial system toward this end given their transdermal injectability, tunable stiffness over a range amenable to tenogenic differentiation of progenitors, and capacity for modular inclusion of biochemical cues. Here, tunable and modular, fiber-reinforced, synthetic hydrogels are employed to elucidate salient microenvironmental determinants of tenogenesis and aligned collagen deposition by tendon progenitor cells. Transforming growth factor \u03b23 drives a cell fate switch toward pro-regenerative or pro-fibrotic phenotypes, which can be biased toward the former by culture in softer microenvironments or inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK activity. Furthermore, studies demonstrate that topographical anisotropy in fiber-reinforced hydrogels critically mediates the alignment of de novo collagen fibrils, reflecting native tendon architecture. These findings inform the design of cell-free, injectable, synthetic hydrogels for tendon tissue regeneration and, likely, that of a range of load-bearing connective tissues.", "Keywords": ["electrospinning", "fiber\u2010reinforced hydrogel composite", "tendon", "tendon progenitor cell", "tenogenesis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Kent", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maggie E", "Last Name": "Jewett", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor P", "Last Name": "Buck", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohamed", "Last Name": "Said", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "LeeAnn A", "Last Name": "Hold", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen A", "Last Name": "Crawford", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan L", "Last Name": "Killian", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Abraham", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice H", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brendon M", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}], "Journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "PubDate": "2024Mar05"}, {"PMID": "37573480", "Title": "Preclinical tendon and ligament models: Beyond the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) to 5W1H (why, who, what, where, when, how).", "Abstract": "Several tendon and ligament animal models were presented at the 2022 Orthopaedic Research Society Tendon Section Conference held at the University of Pennsylvania, May 5 to 7, 2022. A key objective of the breakout sessions at this meeting was to develop guidelines for the field, including for preclinical tendon and ligament animal models. This review summarizes the perspectives of experts for eight surgical small and large animal models of rotator cuff tear, flexor tendon transection, anterior cruciate ligament tear, and Achilles tendon injury using the framework: \"Why, Who, What, Where, When, and How\" (5W1H). A notable conclusion is that the perfect tendon model does not exist; there is no single gold standard animal model that represents the totality of tendon and ligament disease. Each model has advantages and disadvantages and should be carefully considered in light of the specific research question. There are also circumstances when an animal model is not the best approach. The wide variety of tendon and ligament pathologies necessitates choices between small and large animal models, different anatomic sites, and a range of factors associated with each model during the planning phase. Attendees agreed on some guiding principles including: providing clear justification for the model selected, providing animal model details at publication, encouraging sharing of protocols and expertise, improving training of research personnel, and considering greater collaboration with veterinarians.

Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies interfere with cell surface binding proteins that function to promote self-recognition and tolerance, ultimately leading to upregulation of the immune response. Given the striking success of these agents in early trials in melanoma and lung cancer, they have now been studied in many types of cancer and have become a pillar of anticancer therapy for many tumor types. However, abundant upregulation results in a new class of side effects, known as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). It is critical for the practicing radiologist to be able to recognize these events to best contribute to care for patients on checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Here, we provide a comprehensive system-based review of immune-related adverse events and associated imaging findings. Further, we detail the best imaging modalities for each as well as describe problem solving modalities. Given that IRAEs can be subclinical before becoming clinically apparent, radiologists may be the first provider to recognize them, providing an opportunity for early treatment. Awareness of IRAEs and how to best image them will prepare radiologists to make a meaningful contribution to patient care as part of the clinical team.", "Keywords": ["Checkpoint inhibitor", "IRAE", "Immune-related adverse events", "Immunotherapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Neoplasms", "Melanoma", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Lung Neoplasms", "Multimodal Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathleen M", "Last Name": "Capaccione", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W 168(th) Street, New York, New York, 10032.

The pain was assessed using the mouse grimace scale and function by gait analysis and tensile testing. Histological and microCT analyses were used to determine enthesis/tendon and bone structure, respectively. Lineage tracing was carried out using inducible Cre lines for ScxCreERT2 (tendon cells) and \u03b1SMACreERT2 (myofibroblasts and mesenchymal progenitors). Mice only expressed pain transiently after surgery despite long-term impairment of functional and structural properties. Gait, tensile mechanical properties, and bone properties were significantly reduced after injury and repair. Lineage tracing showed relatively few Scx lin tendon cells while \u03b1SMA lin cells contributed strongly to scar formation. Despite surgical reattachment of healthy tendon, lineage tracing revealed poor preservation of supraspinatus tendon after acute injury and loss of tendon structure, suggesting that tendon degeneration is also a key impediment of successful rotator cuff repair.
