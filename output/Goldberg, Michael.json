To address this unmet need, we developed an immunoprofiling platform that uses multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize immune cell heterogeneity in the peripheral blood of healthy donors and patients with advanced cancers. Using unsupervised clustering, we identified five immunotypes with unique distributions of different cell types and gene expression profiles. An independent analysis of 17,800 open-source transcriptomes with the same approach corroborated these findings. Continuous immunotype-based signature scores were developed to correlate systemic immunity with patient responses to different cancer treatments, including immunotherapy, prognostically and predictively.

We use a delayed saccade task to reduce previous confounds and examine the remapping time course in the lateral intraparietal area and frontal eye fields. In the delay period, the RF shift direction turns from the initial fixation to the saccade target. In the perisaccadic period, RFs first shift toward the target (convergent remapping), but around the time of saccade onset/offset, the shifts become predominantly toward the post-saccadic RF locations (forward remapping). Thus, unlike forward remapping that depends on the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command, convergent remapping appears to follow attention from the initial fixation to the target. We model the data with attention-modulated and CD-gated connections and show that both sets of connections emerge automatically in neural networks trained to update stimulus retinal locations across saccades.

This review aims to summarize recent findings on non-anaphylactic eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal adverse events during OIT. Two clinical presentations of non-anaphylactic eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal adverse events during OIT are identified, each with a different paradigm for treatment, and distinguished by their time of onset. In the first clinical entity, characterized by its onset early in the course of treatment, patients present with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or vomiting. The symptoms become evident typically within weeks to months of starting OIT. These symptoms, however, are not temporally related to the time of dose administration, as in the case of immediate IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions. While esophageal biopsies, when performed, can demonstrate eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), baseline esophageal eosinophilia has also been observed in food allergic patients prior to OIT. A potential non-invasive biomarker, the peripheral absolute eosinophil count (AEC), often rises during these reactions and subsides after dose reduction and subsequent resolution of symptoms. OIT can usually then be resumed, albeit at a slower pace, without a recurrence of symptoms. Risk factors for development of symptoms early during OIT include a high starting dose and a baseline AEC of greater than 600. The second, and much less frequently encountered, non-anaphylactic gastrointestinal adverse event related to OIT, presents months to years after initiating OIT. In this latter group, patients present with the classical clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings of EoE. In contrast to the acute onset group, peripheral eosinophilia is usually not observed in these cases.

One of the salient discoveries of modern neuroscience is the role of the hippocampus in establishing gaze-independent, long-term visuospatial memories. The rat hippocampus has neurons which report the animal's position in space regardless of its angle of gaze. Rats with hippocampal lesions are unable to find the location of an escape platform hidden in a pool of opaque fluid, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) based on the visual aspects of their surrounding environment. Here we show that the representation of proprioception in the dysgranular zone of primary somatosensory cortex is equivalently necessary for mice to learn the location of the hidden platform, presumably because without it they cannot create a long-term gaze-independent visuospatial representation of their environment from the retinal signal.

In the perisaccadic period, RFs first shifted toward the target (convergent remapping) but around the time of saccade onset/offset, the shifts became predominantly toward the post-saccadic RF locations (forward remapping). Thus, unlike forward remapping that depends on the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command, convergent remapping appeared to follow attention from the initial fixation to the target.

Although tuning curves and the corresponding population responses contain the same information, they can have different properties. These differences are known to be important because the perception of a stimulus should be decoded from its population response, not from any single tuning curve. The differences are less studied in the spatial domain where a cell's spatial tuning curve is simply its receptive field (RF) profile. Here, we focus on evaluating the common belief that perrisaccadic forward and convergent RF shifts lead to forward (translational) and convergent (compressive) perceptual mislocalization, respectively, and investigate the effects of three related factors: decoders' awareness of RF shifts, changes of cells' covering density near attentional locus (the saccade target), and attentional response modulation. We find that RF shifts alone produce either no shift or an opposite shift of the population responses depending on whether or not decoders are aware of the RF shifts. Thus, forward RF shifts do not predict forward mislocalization. However, convergent RF shifts change cells' covering density for aware decoders (but not for unaware decoders) which may predict convergent mislocalization. Finally, attentional modulation adds a convergent component to population responses for stimuli near the target. We simulate the combined effects of these factors and discuss the results with extant mislocalization data. We speculate that perisaccadic mislocalization might be the flash-lag effect unrelated to perisaccadic RF remapping but to resolve the issue, one has to address the question of whether or not perceptual decoders are aware of RF shifts.", "Keywords": ["FEF", "LIP", "corollary discharge", "forward expansion", "predictive remapping", "space perception", "transsaccadic visual stability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mingsha", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in computational neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36645862", "Title": "Correlation Between the Tragus-Incisal Distance and Interocclusal Rest Distance.", "Abstract": "To evaluate correlations of arch size and sex with the interocclusal rest distance (IORD), as well as to estimate proportional variance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Male", "Female", "Mandible", "Malocclusion", "Vertical Dimension", "Cephalometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yoav", "Last Name": "Pietrokovski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yael", "Last Name": "Houri-Haddad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gilad", "Last Name": "Ben-Gal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The International journal of prosthodontics", "PubDate": "2022Nov-Dec"}, {"PMID": "36509409", "Title": "Factors associated with home epinephrine-treated reactions during peanut and tree-nut oral immunotherapy.", "Abstract": "Home reactions requiring epinephrine administration, a marker of their severity, restrict the widespread use of oral immunotherapy (OIT), but their risk factors are largely not known.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Nuts", "Arachis", "Peanut Hypersensitivity", "Allergens", "Immunotherapy", "Epinephrine", "Administration, Oral", "Sesamum", "Desensitization, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liat", "Last Name": "Nachshon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Allergy, Immunology and Pediatric Pulmonology, Yitzhak Shamir Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel; Department of Medicine, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Elucidating how pancreatic tumor-specific T cells differentiate and are maintained in vivo could inform novel therapeutic avenues to promote T cell antitumor activity. Here, we show that the spleen is a critical site harboring tumor-specific CD8 T cells that functionally segregate based on differential Cxcr3 and Klrg1 expression. Cxcr3+ Klrg1- T cells express the memory stem cell marker Tcf1, whereas Cxcr3-Klrg1\u2009+\u2009T cells express GzmB consistent with terminal differentiation. We identify a Cxcr3+\u2009Klrg1+\u2009intermediate T cell subpopulation in the spleen that is highly enriched for tumor specificity. However, tumor-specific T cells infiltrating primary tumors progressively downregulate both Cxcr3 and Klrg1 while upregulating exhaustion markers PD-1 and Lag-3. We show that antigen-specific T cell infiltration into PDA is Cxcr3 independent. Further, Cxcr3-deficiency results in enhanced antigen-specific T cell IFN\u03b3 production in primary tumors, suggesting that Cxcr3 promotes loss of effector function. Ultimately, however, Cxcr3 was critical for mitigating cancer cell dissemination following immunotherapy with CD40 agonist\u2009+\u2009anti-PD-L1 or T cell receptor engineered T cell therapy targeting mesothelin. In the absence of Cxcr3, splenic Klrg1\u2009+\u2009GzmB\u2009+\u2009antitumor T cells wain while pancreatic cancer disseminates suggesting a role for these cells in eliminating circulating metastatic tumor cells. Intratumoral myeloid cells are poised to produce Cxcl10, whereas splenic DC subsets produce Cxcl9 following immunotherapy supporting differential roles for these chemokines on T cell differentiation.

Numerous regenerative treatment modalities have been reported in the literature with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding optimal methods for predictable regeneration of the peri-implant bone lost due to the disease. This case report presents a 68-year-old healthy, nonsmoking man with peri-implantitis affecting the endosseous implant that replaced the maxillary left first molar. After unsuccessful nonsurgical debridement, regenerative surgical therapy was recommended. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) was performed using natural bovine bone mineral covered with a dehydrated human deepithelialized human amnion-chorion membrane (ddACM). Implant surface decontamination was achieved using a titanium brush. Posttreatment clinical assessment suggested that the patient responded well to surgical regenerative therapy. This response was characterized by the reestablishment of healthy peri-implant soft tissues. From a radiographic perspective, complete bone fill of the peri-implant bony defect was seen. These outcomes were maintained over 2 years. This case demonstrates that it is possible to treat peri-implantitis successfully and obtain stable long-term results with a GBR approach utilizing a xenogeneic bone substitute with ddACM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Amnion", "Animals", "Bone Regeneration", "Cattle", "Chorion", "Dental Implants", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Peri-Implantitis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vinay M", "Last Name": "Bhide", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Howard C", "Last Name": "Tenenbaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The International journal of periodontics & restorative dentistry", "PubDate": "2022May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "35351828", "Title": "Mixed Selectivity in the Cerebellar Purkinje-Cell Response during Visuomotor Association Learning.", "Abstract": "Although the cerebellum has been traditionally considered to be exclusively involved in motor control, recent anatomic and clinical studies show that it also has a role in reward-processing. However, the way in which the movement-related and the reward-related neural activity interact at the level of the cerebellar cortex and contribute toward learning is still unclear. Here, we studied the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when 2 male monkeys learned to associate a right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. These cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol-hand association and a novel symbol-hand association, responding in association with the movement of both hands, although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the movement kinematics, the monkeys' reaction times, or the novelty of the visual symbols. The simple spike activity changed throughout the learning process, but the concurrent complex spikes did not instruct that change. Although these neurons also have reward-related activity, the reward-related and movement-related signals were independent. We suggest that this mixed selectivity may facilitate the flexible learning of difficult reinforcement learning problems.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cerebellum receives both motor-related and reward-related information. However, it is unclear how these two signals interact at the level of cerebellar cortex and contribute to learning nonmotor skills. Here we show that in the mid-lateral cerebellum, the reward information is encoded independently from the motor information such that during reward-based learning, only the reward information carried by the Purkinje cells inform learning while the motor information remains unchanged with learning.", "Keywords": ["Purkinje cells", "cerebellum", "electrophysiology", "primates", "reinforcement learning", "reward"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Association Learning", "Cerebellum", "Female", "Haplorhini", "Learning", "Male", "Movement", "Purkinje Cells", "Reward"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naveen", "Last Name": "Sendhilnathan", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York 10027, New York ns3046@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York 10027, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anna E", "Last Name": "Ipata", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York 10027, New York."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022May04"}, {"PMID": "35309384", "Title": "Stem cell induced inflammatory hypertrophy of the cauda equina.", "Abstract": "Stem cell therapy can present clinicians with challenging clinical scenarios, as access to such treatments outpaces the research into their efficacy and safety due to the burgeoning trend of international travel to acquire stem cell therapy, or \"stem cell tourism.\" Treatment of neurologic conditions remains an enticing potential application of stem cell therapy, often administered intrathecally.

This pattern cannot be explained by classical demographic or selective forces, but imply that DNA replication fidelity has been perturbed in different ways on each branch of the great ape phylogeny. Here, we use whole-genome variation from 88 great apes to investigate whether these species' mutation spectra are broadly differentiated across the entire genome, or whether mutation spectrum differences are driven by DNA compartments that have particular functional features or chromatin states. We perform principal component analysis (PCA) and mutational signature deconvolution on mutation spectra ascertained from compartments defined by features including replication timing and ancient repeat content, finding evidence for consistent species-specific mutational signatures that do not depend on which functional compartments the spectra are ascertained from. At the same time, we find that many compartments have their own characteristic mutational signatures that appear stable across the great ape phylogeny. For example, in a mutation spectrum PCA compartmentalized by replication timing, the second principal component explaining 21.2% of variation separates all species' late-replicating regions from their early-replicating regions. Our results suggest that great ape mutation spectrum evolution is not driven by epigenetic changes that modify mutation rates in specific genomic regions, but instead by trans-acting mutational modifiers that affect mutagenesis across the whole genome fairly uniformly.", "Keywords": ["chromatin landscape", "great ape evolution", "hydroxymethylation", "mutation spectrum", "mutational signatures", "replication timing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA Replication Timing", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Hominidae", "Mutation", "Phylogeny"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelley", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}], "Journal": "Genome biology and evolution", "PubDate": "2022Jan04"}, {"PMID": "33955090", "Title": "Combinatorial advantage of Ses i 1-specific IgE and basophil activation for diagnosis of sesame food allergy.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of sesame food allergy (SFA) is increasing worldwide with the potential of anaphylactic reactions upon exposure.

Although the FEF neurons discharged before these nG saccades, there were three major differences in the neural activity: First, the variability in spike rate across trials decreased only for G saccades. Second, the local field potential beta-band power decreased during G saccades but did not change during nG saccades. Third, the time from saccade direction selection to the saccade onset was significantly longer for G saccades compared with nG saccades.

Notably, FCS 3.2 supports mixed data types to, for example, allow FCS measurements that are intrinsically integers (e.g., indices or class assignments) or measurements that are commonly captured as integers (e.g., time ticks) to be more represented as integer values, while capturing other measurements as floating-point values in the same FCS data set. In addition, keywords explicitly specifying dyes, detectors, and analytes were added to avoid having to extract those heuristically and unreliably from measurement names. Types of measurements were formalized, several keywords added, others removed, or deprecated, and various aspects of the specification were clarified.

As it progresses, it causes serious morbidity in the form of periodontal abscesses and tooth loss and, in the latter stages, pain. It is also now known that periodontitis is strongly associated with several nonoral diseases. Thus, patients with periodontitis are at greater risk for the development and/or exacerbation of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions. Although it is without question that specific groups of oral bacteria which populate dental plaque play a causative role in the development of periodontitis, it is now thought that once this disease has been triggered, other factors play an equal, and possibly more important, role in its progression, particularly in severe cases or in cases that prove difficult to treat. In this regard, we allude to the host response, specifically the notion that the host, once infected with oral periodontal pathogenic bacteria, will mount a defense response mediated largely through the innate immune system. The most abundant cell type of the innate immune system - polymorphonuclear neutrophils - can, when protecting the host from microbial invasion, mount a response that includes upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and reactive oxygen species, all of which then contribute to the tissue damage and loss of teeth commonly associated with periodontitis. Of the mechanisms referred to here, we suggest that upregulation of reactive oxygen species might play one of the most important roles in the establishment and progression of periodontitis (as well as in other diseases of inflammation) through the development of oxidative stress. In this overview, we discuss both innate and epigenetic factors (eg, diabetes, smoking) that lead to the development of oxidative stress. This oxidative stress then provides an environment conducive to the destructive processes observed in periodontitis. Therefore, we shall describe some of the fundamental characteristics of oxidative stress and its effects on the periodontium, discuss the diseases and other factors that cause oxidative stress, and, finally, review potentially novel therapeutic approaches for the management (and possibly even the reversal) of periodontitis, which rely on the use of therapies, such as resveratrol and other antioxidants, that provide increased antioxidant activity in the host.", "Keywords": ["Periodontitis", "ROS", "antioxidant therapy", "oxidative stress", "resveratrol"], "MeSH terms": ["Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Oxidative Stress", "Periodontitis", "Periodontium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "F\u00e1bio S\u00e1 Carneiro", "Last Name": "Sczepanik", "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "M\u00e1rcio Lima", "Last Name": "Grossi", "Affiliation": "School of Health Sciences, Dentistry, Post-Graduate Program in Dentistry, Prosthodontics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "M\u00e1rcio", "Last Name": "Casati", "Affiliation": "Dental Research Division, School of Dentistry, Paulista University (UNIP), Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Discipline of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Glogauer", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Noah", "Last Name": "Fine", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Howard C", "Last Name": "Tenenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Dentistry, Mount Sinai Hospital, Thodupuzha, India."}], "Journal": "Periodontology 2000", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "32822060", "Title": "Neuroradiologic manifestations of COVID-19: what the emergency radiologist needs to know.", "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a new class of hypoglycemic agents that have shown significant promise in the reduction of cardiovascular events. Current guideline recommendations do not support the use of these agents in patients with CKD stage 3 or higher. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate their cardiovascular effects in patients with type 2 DM and CKD stage 3 or higher. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane central, and Embase. Software R was utilized to perform a meta-analysis via the generic inverse variance method. Additionally, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy and safety of each agent. Data from 7 randomized controlled trials and 6527 participants were available. In patients with type 2 DM and CKD, SGLT-2 inhibitor use resulted in a significant relative risk reduction of myocardial infarction (22%), heart failure hospitalization (39%), and major adverse cardiac events (20%) (all P-value < 0.05). There was also a trend towards a reduction in stroke and cardiovascular mortality. In a network meta-analysis, canagliflozin was the most effective in reducing myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization. Empagliflozin performed better for the outcome of cardiovascular mortality, but the results failed to reach significance.

The structure reveals that SidJ contains a protein kinase-like fold domain, which retains a majority of the characteristic kinase catalytic motifs. However, SidJ fails to demonstrate kinase activity.

PIK3CA, the gene encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit p110-alpha, is commonly altered in breast cancer resulting in the constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway. Using an unbiased cell line screening approach, we tested the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to taselisib, a potent PI3K inhibitor, and correlated sensitivity with key biomarkers (PIK3CA, HER2, PTEN, and ESR1). We further assessed how taselisib modulates downstream signaling in the different genomic backgrounds that occur within breast cancer. We found that sensitivity to taselisib correlated with the presence of PIK3CA mutations, but was independent of HER2 status. We further showed that HER2-amplified/PIK3CA wild-type cell lines are not as sensitive to taselisib when compared with HER2-amplified/PIK3CA-mutant cell lines. In a PIK3CA-mutant/PTEN null background, PI3K downstream signaling rebounded in the presence of taselisib correlating with decreased sensitivity at later time points. Finally, we observed that PIK3CA mutations cooccurred with mutations in the estrogen receptor (ER; ESR1) in metastatic tumors from patients with ER+ breast cancer. However, the cooccurrence of an ESR1 mutation with a PIK3CA mutation did not affect response to taselisib in a single agent setting or in combination with fulvestrant. In summary, these data suggest that development of taselisib in breast cancer should occur in a PIK3CA-mutant setting with cotreatments determined by the specific subtypes under investigation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Biomarkers", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Oxazepines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heather M", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Heidi M", "Last Name": "Savage", "Affiliation": "Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Carol", "Last Name": "O'Brien", "Affiliation": "IDEAYA Biosciences, South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Translational Oncology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Ethan S", "Last Name": "Sokol", "Affiliation": "Cancer Genomics Research, Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Cancer Genomics Research, Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Ciara", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "Translational Oncology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Lori S", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "ORIC Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Lackner", "Affiliation": "IDEAYA Biosciences, South San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Timothy R", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California. wilson.timothy@gene.com."}], "Journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "PubDate": "2020Jan"}, {"PMID": "31520457", "Title": "Subperiosteal Papilla Augmentation With a Non-Animal-Derived Hyaluronic Acid Overlay Technique.", "Abstract": "Loss of the interdental papilla, leading to the formation of black triangular spaces just below the contact area of adjacent teeth, is one of the most challenging periodontal conditions to treat and often requires an interdisciplinary approach by the periodontist, restorative dentist, and orthodontist.

The\u00a0immune system is spatiotemporally controlled, so therapies that influence the immune system should be spatiotemporally controlled as well, in order to maximize the therapeutic index. Nanoparticles and biomaterials enable one to program the location, pharmacokinetics and\u00a0co-delivery of immunomodulatory compounds, eliciting responses that cannot be achieved upon administration of such compounds in solution. The convergence of cancer immunotherapy, nanotechnology, bioengineering and drug delivery is opportune, as each of these fields has matured independently to the point that it can now be used to complement the others substantively and rationally, rather than modestly and empirically.

The field has become a cradle of multidisciplinary investigations bringing together physicists, chemists, and engineers working with clinicians and biologists to address paramount problems in cancer care and treatment.

However, three new nanodrugs have now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past three years, confirming the validity of nanotechnology approaches in cancer. Excitingly, translational pipelines contain several additional intriguing candidates. In this Nano Focus article, we discuss potential barriers inhibiting further incorporation of nanomedicines into patient care, possible strategies to overcome these barriers, and promising new directions in cancer interventions based on nanotechnology.

Here, we establish a role for a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein, PLEKHA4, as a modulator of signaling strength in Wnt-receiving cells. PLEKHA4 oligomerizes into clusters at\u00a0PI(4,5)P2-rich regions of the plasma membrane and recruits the Cullin-3 (CUL3) E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor Kelch-like protein 12 (KLHL12) to these assemblies. This recruitment decreases CUL3-KLHL12-mediated polyubiquitination of Dishevelled, a central intermediate in canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. Knockdown of PLEKHA4 in mammalian cells demonstrates that PLEKHA4 positively regulates canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling via these effects on the Dishevelled polyubiquitination machinery. In\u00a0vivo knockout of the Drosophila melanogaster PLEKHA4 homolog, kramer, selectively affects the non-canonical, planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. We propose that PLEKHA4 tunes the sensitivities of cells toward the stimulation of Wnt or PCP signaling by sequestering a key E3 ligase adaptor controlling Dishevelled polyubiquitination within PI(4,5)P2-rich plasma membrane clusters.", "Keywords": ["Cullin-3", "Dishevelled", "Drosophila", "PI(4,5)P(2)", "Wnt signaling", "kramer", "phosphoinositide signaling", "planar cell polarity", "pleckstrin homology domain", "ubiquitination"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Polarity", "Dishevelled Proteins", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Ubiquitination", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adnan", "Last Name": "Shami Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex G", "Last Name": "Batrouni", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongsung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amith", "Last Name": "Punyala", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chun", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus B", "Last Name": "Smolka", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy M", "Last Name": "Baskin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.

Here we show that the arginine methyl transferase protein PRMT5 can complex with FOXP3 transcription factors in Tregs. Mice with conditional knock out (cKO) of PRMT5 expression in Tregs develop severe scurfy-like autoimmunity. In these PRMT5 cKO mice, the spleen has reduced numbers of Tregs, but normal numbers of Tregs are found in the peripheral lymph nodes. These peripheral Tregs that lack PRMT5, however, display a limited suppressive function. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that FOXP3 can be di-methylated at positions R27, R51, and R146. A point mutation of Arginine (R) 51 to Lysine (K) led to defective suppressive functions in human CD4 T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 by DS-437 also reduced human Treg functions and inhibited the methylation of FOXP3. In addition, DS-437 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of anti-erbB2/neu monoclonal antibody targeted therapy in Balb/c mice bearing CT26Her2 tumors by inhibiting Treg function and induction of tumor immunity.

However, whether these resistance mutations are in cis or trans has therapeutic implications for patients. We analyzed a cohort of 29 patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations at codons 792, 796, or 797 to establish the configuration of these mutations. We performed hybrid capture-based, next-generation sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue or liquid biopsy. 27 samples had both a T790M mutation and a mutation at codons 792, 796, or 797. In all of these cases, the mutations were found in the cis configuration; the trans configuration was not observed. Two patients' samples harbored a mutation at codon 797 but no T790M mutation. In these two cases, longitudinal analysis showed earlier biopsies harbored EGFR T790M, which was undetectable following osimertinib treatment. Treatment of one these patients with both first- and third-generation EGFR TKIs resulted in a mixed response. Here we describe multiple configurations of EGFR T790M and third-generation TKI resistance mutations at codons 792, 796, and 797.

This Ca2+ rise sets off a series of downstream events, including the completion of meiosis and the dynamic remodeling of the oocyte transcriptome and proteome, which prepares the oocyte for embryogenesis. Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that is activated by Ca2+ upon egg activation and that is required for the resumption of meiosis in Xenopus,, ascidians, and Drosophila. The molecular mechanisms by which calcineurin transduces the calcium signal to regulate meiosis and other downstream events are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the regulatory role of calcineurin during egg activation in Drosophila melanogaster,. Using mass spectrometry, we quantify the phosphoproteomic and proteomic changes that occur during egg activation, and we examine how these events are affected when calcineurin function is perturbed in female germ cells.

Pattern recognition receptor agonists are a growing class of potential adjuvants that can shape the character of the immune response to subunit vaccines by directing the polarization of CD4 T cell differentiation to various functional subsets. In the current study, we applied a high-throughput in vitro screen to assess murine CD4 T cell polarization by a panel of pattern recognition receptor agonists. This identified lipopeptides with TLR2 agonist activity as exceptional Th1-polarizing adjuvants. In vivo, we demonstrated that i.v. administration of TLR2 agonists with Ag in mice replicated the findings from in vitro screening by promoting strong Th1 polarization. In contrast, TLR2 agonists inhibited priming of Th1 responses when administered cutaneously in mice. This route-specific suppression was associated with infiltrating CCR2+ cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes and was not uniquely dependent on any of the well characterized subsets of dendritic cells known to reside in the skin. We further demonstrated that priming of CD4 T cells to generate Th1 effectors following immunization with the Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strain, a lipoprotein-rich bacterium recognized by TLR2, was dependent on the immunization route, with significantly greater Th1 responses with i.v. compared with intradermal administration of BCG. A more complete understanding of route-dependent TLR2 responses may be critical for informed design of novel subunit vaccines and for improvement of BCG and other vaccines based on live-attenuated organisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Cell Movement", "Cells, Cultured", "Drug Administration Routes", "Female", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunization", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Monocytes", "Mycobacterium bovis", "Receptors, CCR2", "Repressor Proteins", "Skin", "Th1 Cells", "Toll-Like Receptor 2", "Vaccination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher T", "Last Name": "Johndrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455."}, {"First Name": "Alison J", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Tony W", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Shajo", "Last Name": "Kunnath-Velayudhan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Gregoire", "Last Name": "Lauvau", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Daniel H", "Last Name": "Kaplan", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261."}, {"First Name": "Graeme H", "Last Name": "Gossel", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Hunter College and the City University of New York, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich D", "Last Name": "Kadolsky", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St. Thomas' National Health Service Foundation Trust and King's College London, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "William R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Porcelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461; steven.porcelli@einstein.yu.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2018Dec15"}, {"PMID": "30413145", "Title": "Pseudophakic mini-monovision: high patient satisfaction, reduced spectacle dependence, and low cost.", "Abstract": "Cataract surgery with pseudophakic mini-monovision has lower out-of-pocket patient expense than premium multifocal intraocular lenses (IOL).

Here, we report the identification and characterization of diamond (dind), an essential Drosophila gene required both for mitosis of larval brain cells and for male meiosis. Larvae homozygous for any of the\u00a0five EMS-induced mutations die in the third-instar stage and exhibit multiple mitotic defects. Mutant brain cells exhibit poorly condensed chromosomes and frequent chromosome breaks and rearrangements; they also show centriole fragmentation, disorganized mitotic spindles, defective chromosome segregation, endoreduplicated metaphases, and hyperploid and polyploid cells. Comparable phenotypes occur in mutant spermatogonia and spermatocytes. The dind gene encodes a non-conserved protein with no known functional motifs. Although the\u00a0Dind protein\u00a0exhibits a rather diffuse localization in both interphase and mitotic cells, fractionation experiments indicate that some Dind is tightly associated with the chromatin.

Most notably, in late 2017, the window for treatment expanded to 24\u00a0h from onset of stroke symptoms in selected patients. Furthermore, for those patients in expanded time windows, guidelines issued in early 2018 now recommend the use of \"advanced\" imaging techniques in the acute setting, including CT perfusion and MRI, to guide therapeutic decision-making.

Abnormalities of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis in acromegaly lead to the characteristic cardiovascular manifestations of this disease. One hallmark feature of the disease is acromegalic cardiomyopathy, a syndrome of progressive cardiac dysfunction characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the very advanced stage. In this article, we review the current concepts regarding the pathophysiology of acromegalic cardiomyopathy and discuss the various risk factors for its development.

We previously reported that STK11/LKB1 (KL) or TP53 (KP) comutations define distinct subgroups of KRAS-mutant LUAC. Here, we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups. Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly among KL (7.4%), KP (35.7%), and K-only (28.6%) subgroups (P < 0.001) in the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) cohort (174 patients) with KRAS-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate-057 phase III trial (0% vs. 57.1% vs. 18.2%; P = 0.047). In the SU2C cohort, KL LUAC exhibited shorter progression-free (P < 0.001) and overall (P = 0.0015) survival compared with KRASMUT;STK11/LKB1WT LUAC. Among 924 LUACs, STK11/LKB1 alterations were the only marker significantly associated with PD-L1 negativity in TMBIntermediate/High LUAC. The impact of STK11/LKB1 alterations on clinical outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. In Kras-mutant murine LUAC models, Stk11/Lkb1 loss promoted PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor resistance, suggesting a causal role. Our results identify STK11/LKB1 alterations as a major driver of primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in KRAS-mutant LUAC.Significance: This work identifies STK11/LKB1 alterations as the most prevalent genomic driver of primary resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitors in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Genomic profiling may enhance the predictive utility of PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden and facilitate establishment of personalized combination immunotherapy approaches for genomically defined LUAC subsets.

This highlights the need for better agents. Several groups, including our own, have reported that the over-the-counter laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) has remarkable efficacy in rodent models of colon carcinogenesis. In this study, we undertook the first randomized human trial to address the role of PEG in prevention of human colonic neoplasia. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm trial where eligible subjects were randomized to 8g PEG-3350 (n = 27) or 17g PEG-3350 (n = 24), or placebo (n = 24; maltodextrin) orally for a duration of six months. Our initial primary endpoint was rectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF) but this was changed during protocol period to rectal mucosal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Of the 87 patients randomized, 48 completed study primary endpoints and rectal EGFR unchanged PEG treatment. Rectal ACF had a trend suggesting potentially reduction with PEG treatment (pre-post change 1.7 in placebo versus -0.3 in PEG 8+ 17g doses, p = 0.108). Other endpoints (proliferation, apoptosis, expression of SNAIL and E-cadherin), previously noted to be modulated in rodent models, appeared unchanged with PEG treatment in this clinical trial. We conclude that PEG was generally well tolerated with the trial failing to meet primary efficacy endpoints. However, rectal ACFs demonstrated a trend (albeit statistically insignificant) for suppression with PEG. Moreover, all molecular assays including EGFR were unaltered with PEG underscoring issues with lack of translatability of biomarkers from preclinical to clinical trials.

The ability to concentrate immunostimulatory compounds at the site of disease can overcome local immune tolerance and reduce systemic toxicity. Surgical resection of tumors may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by removing the concentrated immunosuppressive microenvironment; however, it also removes tumor-specific leukocytes as well as tumor antigens that may be important to establishing antitumor immunity. Moreover, surgery produces a transient immunosuppressive state associated with wound healing that has been correlated with increased metastasis. Using multiple models of spontaneous metastasis, we show that extended release of agonists of innate immunity-including agonists of Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-from a biodegradable hydrogel placed in the tumor resection site cured a much higher percentage of animals than systemic or local administration of the same therapy in solution. Depletion and neutralization experiments confirmed that the observed prevention of local tumor recurrence and eradication of existing metastases require both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The localized therapy increased the numbers of activated natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and T cells and induced production of large amounts of type I interferons, thereby converting an immunosuppressive post-resection microenvironment into an immunostimulatory one.

TMDs are characterized by pain, joint sounds and restricted mandibular movement, and drugs are widely used in the management of that pain. Pharmacological agents commonly used for the treatment of TMDs include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. In this paper, we discuss these agents and the potential adverse drug reactions and interactions associated with their use. Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a collective term used for a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory muscle complex, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated structures. TMD is one of the most common disorders in the maxillofacial region. Signs and symptoms of TMD may include pain, impaired jaw function, malocclusion, deviation from the midline on opening or closing the jaw, limited range of motion, joint noises and locking.1 Among other signs and symptoms, headaches and sleep disturbances can appear concomitantly.2 This disorder is most prevalent in people aged 20-40 years.3 Approximately 33% of the population have at least 1 TMD symptom, and 3.6-7.0% of the population have TMD with sufficient severity to seek treatment.3 There is some evidence to suggest that anxiety, stress and other emotional disturbances exacerbate TMD.4 As many as 75% of patients with TMD have a significant psychological abnormality.5 Most TMD symptoms resolve over time, but, for a significant number of patients, this may take a year or more.3 Treatment is directed toward reducing pain and improving function. Many non-invasive therapies, such as self-care, physical therapy and appliance therapy, are commonly used for the treatment of TMD.3 Pharmacological intervention has been used for many years, and the most effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of TMD include analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, corticosteroids, anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. However, we found only 1 relevant Cochrane study, which included 11 randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapy for TMD.6 In this article, we review the pharmacology and research supporting the use of a host of pharmacologic agents that have been prescribed for patients who have TMD.

Among the individual tumors examined, the majority showed at least one detectable alteration (97.2%). Among 2,045 molecular aberrations was the involvement of 302 distinct genes. The most commonly altered genes were TP53 (47.0%), CDKN2A (18.0%), TERT (17.0%), and KRAS (16.0%), and the majority of patients had tumors that harbored multiple alterations. Tumors displayed a median of four alterations (range, 0-29). Most individuals had at least one potentially actionable alteration (94.7%), with the median number of potentially actionable alterations per patient being 2 (range, 0-13). A total of 1,048 (94.2%) patients exhibited a unique molecular profile, with either genes altered or loci within the gene(s) altered being distinct.

Although several methods exist for identifying Ag-specific T cells, including intracellular cytokine staining, cell surface cytokine-capture assays, and staining with peptide:MHC class II multimers, all of these have significant technical constraints that limit their usefulness. Measurement of activation-induced expression of CD154 has been reported to detect live Ag-specific CD4+ T cells, but this approach remains underexplored and, to our knowledge, has not previously been applied in mycobacteria-infected animals. In this article, we show that CD154 expression identifies adoptively transferred or endogenous Ag-specific CD4+ T cells induced by Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination. We confirmed that Ag-specific cytokine production was positively correlated with CD154 expression by CD4+ T cells from bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin-vaccinated mice and show that high-quality microarrays can be performed from RNA isolated from CD154+ cells purified by cell sorting. Analysis of microarray data demonstrated that the transcriptome of CD4+ CD154+ cells was distinct from that of CD154- cells and showed major enrichment of transcripts encoding multiple cytokines and pathways of cellular activation. One notable finding was the identification of a previously unrecognized subset of mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells that is characterized by the production of IL-3.

Mitotic activation of Gwl requires both cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-dependent phosphorylation and its autophosphorylation at an evolutionarily conserved serine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Ser-883 in Xenopus). In this study we show that Gwl associates with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), particularly PP1\u03b3, which mediates the dephosphorylation of Gwl Ser-883. Consistent with the mitotic activation of Gwl, its association with PP1 is disrupted in mitotic cells and egg extracts. During mitotic exit, PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of Gwl Ser-883 occurs prior to dephosphorylation of other mitotic substrates; replacing endogenous Gwl with a phosphomimetic S883E mutant blocks mitotic exit. Moreover, we identified PP1 regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) as a targeting subunit that can direct PP1 activity toward Gwl. PPP1R3B bridges PP1 and Gwl association and promotes Gwl Ser-883 dephosphorylation. Consistent with the cell cycle-dependent association of Gwl and PP1, Gwl and PPP1R3B dissociate in M phase.

Binding of PIP2 to ezrin induces a conformational change permitting the insertion of the LOK C-terminal domain to wedge apart the membrane and F-actin-binding domains of ezrin.

We suggest that this elaborate mechanism ensures that ezrin is only phosphorylated at the plasma membrane, and with high specificity by the apically localized kinase LOK.", "Keywords": ["Cell polarity", "Ezrin", "LOK", "Microvilli", "SLK", "biochemistry", "cell biology", "human"], "MeSH terms": ["Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thaher", "Last Name": "Pelaseyed", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}, {"First Name": "Raghuvir", "Last Name": "Viswanatha", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9cile", "Last Name": "Sauvanet", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Filter", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Bretscher", "Affiliation": "Weill Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2017Apr21"}, {"PMID": "28387646", "Title": "Unfair competition governs the interaction of pCPI-17 with myosin phosphatase (PP1-MYPT1).", "Abstract": "The small phosphoprotein pCPI-17 inhibits myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP).

Comparison of alteration frequencies to The Cancer Genome Atlas identified some differences and suggested an enrichment of treatment-refractory samples in breast and lung cancer cohorts. To illustrate novelty within the dataset, we surveyed the genomic landscape of rare diseases and identified an increased frequency of NOTCH1 alterations in adenoid cystic carcinomas compared with previous studies. Analysis of tumor suppressor gene patterns revealed disease specificity for certain genes but broad inactivation of others. We identified multiple potentially druggable, novel and known kinase fusions in diseases beyond those in which they are currently recognized. Analysis of variants of unknown significance identified an enrichment of SMAD4 alterations in colon cancer and other rare alterations predicted to have functional impact. Analysis of established, clinically relevant alterations highlighted the spectrum of molecular changes for which testing is currently recommended, as well as opportunities for expansion of indications for use of approved targeted therapies.

We previously reported that a genetically modified strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis called IKEPLUS is a promising TB vaccine candidate. Since protective immunity induced by IKEPLUS is dependent on antigen-specific CD4+ T cell memory, we hypothesized that the specificity of the CD4+ T cell response was a critical feature of this protection. Using in vitro assays of interferon gamma production (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot [ELISPOT] assays) by splenocytes from IKEPLUS-immunized C57BL/6J mice, we identified an immunogenic peptide within the mycobacterial ribosomal large subunit protein RplJ, encoded by the Rv0651 gene. In a complementary approach, we generated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted T cell hybridomas from IKEPLUS-immunized mice. Screening of these T cell hybridomas against IKEPLUS and ribosomes enriched from IKEPLUS suggested that the CD4+ T cell response in IKEPLUS-immunized mice was dominated by the recognition of multiple components of the mycobacterial ribosome. Importantly, CD4+ T cells specific for mycobacterial ribosomes accumulate to significant levels in the lungs of IKEPLUS-immunized mice following aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, consistent with a role for these T cells in protective host immunity in TB. The identification of CD4+ T cell responses to defined ribosomal protein epitopes expands the range of antigenic targets for adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis and may help to inform the design of more effective vaccines against tuberculosis.", "Keywords": ["T cells", "antigen", "epitope", "ribosome", "tuberculosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epitope Mapping", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Female", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Immunization", "Mice", "Mycobacterium", "Peptides", "Ribosomal Proteins", "T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity", "Tuberculosis", "Virulence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison J", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven C", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia S", "Last Name": "Lindestam Arlehamn", "Affiliation": "Department of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neeraj K", "Last Name": "Saini", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiayong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sinu", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Department of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Subray S", "Last Name": "Hegde", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Blanchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "William R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Sette", "Affiliation": "Department of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Porcelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA steven.porcelli@einstein.yu.edu."}], "Journal": "Infection and immunity", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "27989463", "Title": "Coupling between One-Dimensional Networks Reconciles Conflicting Dynamics in LIP and Reveals Its Recurrent Circuitry.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the internal circuitry of the primate lateral intraparietal area (LIP).

Diseases caused by Salmonella are treatable with antibiotics, but successful antibiotic treatment has become difficult due to antimicrobial resistance and collateral effects on the microbiome. An effective vaccine together with public health efforts may be a better strategy to control these infections. Protective immunity against Salmonella depends primarily on CD4 T-cell-mediated immune responses; therefore, identifying relevant T-cell antigens is necessary for Salmonella vaccine development. We previously used a dendritic-cell-based immunoproteomics approach in our laboratory to identify T-cell antigens. The testing of these antigens as vaccine candidates against Chlamydia infection in mice yielded positive results. We applied this technology in the present study by infecting murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells from C57BL/6 mice with Salmonella enterica strain SL1344, followed by immunoaffinity isolation of MHC class I and II molecules and elution of bound peptides. The sequences of the peptides were identified using tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 87 MHC class-II- and 23 MHC class-I-binding Salmonella-derived peptides. Four of the 12 highest scoring class-II-binding Salmonella peptides stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells from the spleens of mice with persistent Salmonella infection.

Nrf2(-/-) mice had more severe loss of periodontium in response to periodontitis-inducing subgingival ligatures compared with wild-types. Levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine were increased in periodontal lesions of Nrf2(-/-) mice, indicating high oxidative damage.

However, based on experiments several decades ago which demonstrated that tetracyclines, unexpectedly, inhibit collagen- and bone-destructive mammalian-derived enzymes (e.g. the collagenases), and through non-antibiotic mechanisms, the concept of host-modulation therapy (HMT) was developed. Accordingly, two drug-development strategies evolved: (i) the development of non-antimicrobial formulations of doxycycline; and (ii) the chemical modification of tetracyclines to eliminate their antibiotic activity but retain (or even enhance) their anti-collagenase properties. Regarding the latter, these chemically modified tetracyclines (CMTs) showed efficacy in vitro, in animal models of periodontal (and relevant systemic) disease, and in preliminary clinical trials on patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (however, at the high doses used, photosensitivity was a significant side-effect). In the first strategy, subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline (SDD) demonstrated safety and efficacy in human clinical trials and was approved by the U S Food and Drug Administration (U S FDA) and in other countries for the treatment of periodontitis (20 mg, twice daily, i.e. once every 12 hours) adjunctive to scaling and root planing, and for chronic inflammatory skin diseases (40-mg sustained-release 'beads'). SDD also showed efficacy in patients with systemic diseases relevant to periodontitis, including diabetes mellitus and arthritis, and in postmenopausal women with local and systemic bone loss. Importantly, long-term administration of SDD, of up to 2 years, in clinical trials did not produce antibiotic side-effects.

However, little is known about adaptation across sensory modalities, especially in the context of high-level processing, such as the perception of emotion. Previous studies have shown that prolonged exposure to a face exhibiting one emotion, such as happiness, leads to contrastive biases in the perception of subsequently presented faces toward the opposite emotion, such as sadness. Such work has shown the importance of adaptation in calibrating face perception based on prior visual exposure. In the present study, we showed for the first time that emotion-laden sounds, like laughter, adapt the visual perception of emotional faces, that is, subjects more frequently perceived faces as sad after listening to a happy sound. Furthermore, via electroencephalography recordings and event-related potential analysis, we showed that there was a neural correlate underlying the perceptual bias: There was an attenuated response occurring at \u223c 400 ms to happy test faces and a quickened response to sad test faces, after exposure to a happy sound.

In the first systematic evaluation of the PD-1 pathway in esophageal adenocarcinoma, we identify expression of PD-L2 in cancer cells in 51.7% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. Epithelial PD-L1 was expressed on only 2% of cases, although PD-L1(+) immune cells were observed in 18% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. We also evaluated expression in the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett's esophagus, which emerges following gastric reflux-induced esophageal inflammation, and found PD-L2 expression in Barrett's esophagus but not in non-Barrett's esophagus esophagitis. Because the progression from squamous esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus is accompanied by a transition from a TH1 to TH2 immune response, we hypothesized that the TH2 cytokines IL4/IL13 could contribute to PD-L2 induction.

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy each confer clinical benefit, albeit limited as monotherapies. Ovarian cancer is not particularly responsive to immune checkpoint blockade, so combination with a complementary therapy may be beneficial. Recent studies have revealed that a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, azacytidine, alters expression of immunoregulatory genes in ovarian cancer. In this study, the antitumor effects of a related DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, decitabine (DAC), were demonstrated in a syngeneic murine ovarian cancer model. Low-dose DAC treatment increases the expression of chemokines that recruit NK cells and CD8(+) T cells, promotes their production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, and extends the survival of mice bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic tumors. While neither DAC nor immune checkpoint blockade confers durable responses as a monotherapy in this model, the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 was potentiated by combination with DAC. This combination promotes differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into effector T cells and prolongs cytotoxic lymphocyte responses as well as mouse survival.

While current prognoses for such patients are rather poor, inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) induces synthetic lethality in cells that are defective in homologous recombination. BMN 673 is a potent PARP1 inhibitor that is being clinically evaluated for treatment of BRCA-mutant cancers. Using the Brca1-deficient murine epithelial ovarian cancer cell line BR5FVB1-Akt, we investigated whether the antitumor effects of BMN 673 extend beyond its known pro-apoptotic function. Administration of modest amounts of BMN 673 greatly improved the survival of mice bearing subcutaneous or intraperitoneal tumors. We thus hypothesized that BMN 673 may influence the composition and function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, BMN 673 significantly increases the number of peritoneal CD8(+) T cells and NK cells as well as their production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. These data suggest that the cell stress caused by BMN 673 induces not only cancer cell-intrinsic apoptosis but also cancer cell-extrinsic antitumor immune effects in a syngeneic murine model of ovarian cancer.

As such, complementary therapeutic strategies are being explored to prevent relapse. The altered metabolic state of cancer cells, which perform aerobic glycolysis, represents an interesting target that can enable discrimination between healthy cells and cancer cells. We hypothesized that cosilencing of genes responsible for aerobic glycolysis and for MDR would have synergistic antitumor effect. In this study, siRNA duplexes against pyruvate kinase M2 and multidrug resistance gene-1 were encapsulated in hyaluronic acid-based self-assembling nanoparticles. The particles were characterized for morphology, size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, and transfection efficiency. In vivo studies included biodistribution assessment, gene knockdown confirmation, therapeutic efficacy, and safety analysis. The benefit of active targeting of cancer cells was confirmed by modifying the particles' surface with a peptide targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor, which is overexpressed on the membranes of the SKOV-3 cancer cells. To augment the studies involving transplantation of a paclitaxel-resistant cell line, an in vivo paclitaxel resistance model was developed by injecting repeated doses of paclitaxel following tumor inoculation. The nanoparticles accumulated significantly in the tumors, hindering tumor volume doubling time (P < 0.05) upon combination therapy in both the wild-type (2-fold) and resistant (8-fold) xenograft models.

Tumor-targeted nanocarriers have generally been used to localize chemotherapeutics to tumors and thus decrease off-target toxicity while enhancing efficacy. Challengingly, tumor heterogeneity and evolution render tumor-intrinsic approaches likely to succumb to relapse. The immune system offers exquisite specificity, cytocidal potency, and long-term activity that leverage an adaptive memory response. For this reason, the ability to manipulate immune cell specificity and function would be desirable, and nanoparticles represent an exciting means by which to perform such manipulation. Dendritic cells and tumor-associated macrophages are cells of the myeloid lineage that function as natural phagocytes, so they naturally take up nanoparticles. Dendritic cells direct the specificity and potency of cellular immune responses that can be targeted for cancer vaccines. Herein, we discuss the specific criteria needed for efficient vaccine design, including but not limited to the route of administration, size, morphology, surface charge, targeting ligands, and nanoparticle composition. In contrast, tumor-associated macrophages are critical mediators of immunosuppression whose trans-migratory abilities can be exploited to localize therapeutics to the tumor core and which can be directly targeted for elimination or for repolarization to a tumor suppressive phenotype.

In chronic pain disorders, rumination can impede treatment efficacy. The brain mechanisms underlying rumination about chronic pain are not understood. Interestingly, a link between rumination and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain's default mode network (DMN) has been identified within the context of mood disorders. We, and others, have also found DMN dysfunction in chronic pain populations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key node of the DMN that is anatomically connected with the descending pain modulatory system. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that in patients with chronic pain, the mPFC exhibits abnormal FC related to the patient's degree of rumination about their pain. Seventeen patients with idiopathic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent resting state functional MRI, and rumination about pain was assessed through the rumination subscale of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale.

We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for PP2A-B55's action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M phase PP2A-B55's attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55.

Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating and characterizing a similar extrafoveal preview benefit in monkeys during a free-viewing visual search task.

When the HoxA1 gene was silenced in vivo via intraductal delivery of nanoparticle-formulated small interfering RNA (siRNA) through the nipple of transgenic mice with early-stage disease, mammary epithelial cell proliferation rates were suppressed, loss of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression was prevented, and tumor incidence was reduced by 75%.

We previously showed that the mean spike rate of LIP neurons is strongly influenced by spatially wide-ranging surround suppression in a manner that effectively sharpens the priority map. Reducing response variability can also improve the precision of LIP's priority map. We show that when a monkey plans a visually guided delayed saccade with an intervening distractor, variability (measured by the Fano factor) decreases both for neurons representing the saccade goal and for neurons representing the broad spatial surround. The reduction in Fano factor is maximal for neurons representing the saccade goal and steadily decreases for neurons representing more distant locations. LIP Fano factor changes are behaviorally significant: increasing expected reward leads to lower variability for the LIP representation of both the target and distractor locations, and trials with shorter latency saccades are associated with lower Fano factors in neurons representing the surround. Thus, the LIP Fano factor reflects both stimulus and behavioral engagement. Quantitative modeling shows that the interaction between mean spike count and target-receptive field (RF) distance in the surround during the predistractor epoch is multiplicative: the Fano factor increases more steeply with mean spike count further away from the RF. A negative-binomial model for LIP spike counts captures these findings quantitatively, suggests underlying mechanisms based on trial-by-trial variations in mean spike rate or burst-firing patterns, and potentially provides a principled framework to account simultaneously for the previously observed unsystematic relationships between spike rate and variability in different brain areas.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Attention", "Brain", "Macaca", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Saccades", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Annegret L", "Last Name": "Falkner", "Affiliation": "Mahoney-Keck Center for Brain and Behavior Research, Department of Neuroscience, and Departments of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Ophthalmology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, 37077 Goettingen, Germany, Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, German Primate Center, 37077 Goettingen, Germany, and Department of Neuroscience, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "B Suresh", "Last Name": "Krishna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Oct09"}, {"PMID": "24019132", "Title": "Nanoscale markers of esophageal field carcinogenesis: potential implications for esophageal cancer screening.", "Abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a dismal prognosis unless treated early or prevented at the precursor stage of Barrett's esophagus-associated dysplasia.

Previously, low-coherence enhanced backscattering spectroscopy (LEBS) has demonstrated the ability to discriminate between normal and diseased organs based on measurements of histologically normal-appearing tissue in the field of colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic (PC) cancers. Here, we implement the more comprehensive enhanced backscattering (EBS) spectroscopy to better understand the structural and optical changes which lead to the previous findings. EBS provides high-resolution measurement of the spatial reflectance profile P(rs) between 30 microns and 2.7 mm, where information about nanoscale mass density fluctuations in the mucosa can be quantified. A demonstration of the length-scales at which P(rs) is optimally altered in CRC and PC field carcinogenesis is given and subsequently these changes are related to the tissue's structural composition. Three main conclusions are made. First, the most significant changes in P(rs) occur at short length-scales corresponding to the superficial mucosal layer. Second, these changes are predominantly attributable to a reduction in the presence of subdiffractional structures.

The aggressiveness of melanoma is due to its capacity to proliferate and rapidly invade surrounding tissues, leading to metastases. A recent model suggests melanoma progresses by reversibly switching between proliferation and invasion transcriptional signatures. Recent studies show that cancer cells are more sensitive to microRNA (miRNA) perturbation than are non-cancer cells; however, the roles of miRNAs in melanoma plasticity remain unexplored. Here, we use the gene expression profiles of melanoma and normal melanocytes to characterize the transcription factor-miRNA relationship that modulates the proliferative and invasive programs of melanoma. We identified two sets of miRNAs that likely regulate these programs. Interestingly, one of the miRNAs involved in melanoma invasion is miR-211, a known target of the master regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We demonstrate that miR-211 contributes to melanoma adhesion by directly targeting a gene, NUAK1. Inhibition of miR-211 increases NUAK1 expression and decreases melanoma adhesion, whereas upregulation of miR-211 restores adhesion through NUAK1 repression. This study defines the MITF/miR-211 axis that inhibits the invasive program by blocking adhesion. Furthermore, we have identified NUAK1 as a potential target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Binding Sites", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Melanoma", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Protein Kinases", "Repressor Proteins", "Skin Neoplasms", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel E", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Mehdi", "Last Name": "Khaled", "Affiliation": "Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dvir", "Last Name": "Netanely", "Affiliation": "Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Steffen", "Last Name": "Schubert", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamar", "Last Name": "Golan", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Amir", "Last Name": "Buxbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Maja M", "Last Name": "Janas", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benny", "Last Name": "Postolsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Shamir", "Affiliation": "Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Carmit", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

A wide array of structurally diverse agents does not interact directly with Nlrp3, but is thought to activate the Nlrp3 inflammasome by inducing a common upstream signal, such as lysosome rupture. To test the connection between lysosome integrity and Nlrp3 signaling, we analyzed inflammasome activation following stimulation of murine macrophages with lysosome-destabilizing agents and pyroptosis inducers. Here we provide evidence that lysosomal rupture and the corresponding release of lysosomal hydrolases is an early event in macrophages exposed to the lysosome-destabilizing adjuvants LLOMe and alum. Lysosome rupture preceded cell death induction mediated by these agents and was associated with the degradation of low-molecular weight proteins, including the inflammasome component caspase-1. Proteolysis of caspase-1 was controlled by specific cathepsins, but was independent of autocatalytic processes and Nlrp3 signaling. Consistent with these findings, lysosome-disrupting agents triggered only minimal caspase-1 activation and failed to cause caspase-1-dependent cell death (pyroptosis), generally associated with Nlrp3 signaling. In contrast, lysosome rupture was a late event in macrophages exposed to prototypical pyroptosis inducers. These agents triggered extensive Nlrp3 signaling prior to lysosome rupture with only minimal impact on the cellular proteome. Taken together, our findings suggest that lysosome impairment triggers a cascade of events culminating in cell death but is not crucial for Nlrp3 signaling. The significant differences observed between lysosome-disrupting agents and pyroptosis inducers might explain the distinct immunologic responses associated with these compounds.", "Keywords": ["Nlrp3 inflammasome", "caspase-1", "lysosome rupture", "necrosis", "pyroptosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Alum Compounds", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Blotting, Western", "Carrier Proteins", "Caspase 1", "Cell Line", "Dipeptides", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Inflammasomes", "Lysosomes", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Necrosis", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heriberto", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lee S", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kartik", "Last Name": "Chandran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Felipe", "Last Name": "Diaz-Griffero", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Lisanti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J\u00fcrgen", "Last Name": "Brojatsch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23652360", "Title": "Impaired lipopolysaccharide responsiveness of cord blood mononuclear cells and the risk of asthma: a longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "We previously demonstrated that the proliferative response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) is negatively correlated with the induced expression of interleukin (IL)-4.

AKT3 is expressed in immune cells and is the major AKT isoform in the CNS representing 30% of the total AKT expressed in spinal cord, and 50% in the brain. Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a mouse model in which lymphocytes and monocytes enter the CNS, resulting in inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury. We hypothesized that during EAE, deletion of AKT3 would negatively affect the CNS of AKT3(-/-) mice, making them more susceptible to CNS damage. During acute EAE, AKT3(-/-)mice were more severely affected than wild type (WT) mice. Evaluation of spinal cords showed that during acute and chronic disease, AKT3(-/-) spinal cords had more demyelination compared with WT spinal cords. Quantitative RT-PCR determined higher levels of IL-2, IL-17, and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in spinal cords from AKT3(-/-) mice than WT. Experiments using bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that AKT3(-/-) mice receiving AKT3-deficient bone marrow cells had elevated clinical scores relative to control WT mice reconstituted with WT cells, indicating that altered function of both CNS cells and bone marrow-derived immune cells contributed to the phenotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased numbers of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the spinal cord of AKT3(-/-) mice compared with WT mice, whereas in vitro suppression assays showed that AKT3-deficient Th cells were less susceptible to regulatory T cell-mediated suppression than their WT counterparts. These results indicate that AKT3 signaling contributes to the protection of mice against EAE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Animals", "Chronic Disease", "Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Inflammation Mediators", "Lumbosacral Region", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein", "Peptide Fragments", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Severity of Illness Index", "Signal Transduction", "Spinal Cord"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vladislav", "Last Name": "Tsiperson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ross C", "Last Name": "Gruber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ayana", "Last Name": "Jordan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason G", "Last Name": "Weinger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fernando", "Last Name": "Macian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Shafit-Zagardo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2013Feb15"}, {"PMID": "23297415", "Title": "Cathepsin-mediated necrosis controls the adaptive immune response by Th2 (T helper type 2)-associated adjuvants.", "Abstract": "Immunologic adjuvants are critical components of vaccines, but it remains unclear how prototypical adjuvants enhance the adaptive immune response. Recent studies have shown that necrotic cells could trigger an immune response. Although most adjuvants have been shown to be cytotoxic, this activity has traditionally been considered a side effect. We set out to test the role of adjuvant-mediated cell death in immunity and found that alum, the most commonly used adjuvant worldwide, triggers a novel form of cell death in myeloid leukocytes characterized by cathepsin-dependent lysosome-disruption. We demonstrated that direct lysosome-permeabilization with a soluble peptide, Leu-Leu-OMe, mimics the alum-like form of necrotic cell death in terms of cathepsin dependence and cell-type specificity. Using a combination of a haploid genetic screen and cathepsin-deficient cells, we identified specific cathepsins that control lysosome-mediated necrosis. We identified cathepsin C as critical for Leu-Leu-OMe-induced cell death, whereas cathepsins B and S were required for alum-mediated necrosis. Consistent with a role of necrotic cell death in adjuvant effects, Leu-Leu-OMe replicated an alum-like immune response in vivo, characterized by dendritic cell activation, granulocyte recruitment, and production of Th2-associated antibodies. Strikingly, cathepsin C deficiency not only blocked Leu-Leu-OMe-mediated necrosis but also impaired Leu-Leu-OMe-enhanced immunity. Together our findings suggest that necrotic cell death is a powerful mediator of a Th2-associated immune response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adjuvants, Immunologic", "Animals", "Caspase 1", "Cathepsin C", "Cathepsins", "Cell Death", "Cell Line", "Female", "Granulocytes", "Immune System", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation", "Lysosomes", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Necrosis", "Peptides", "Signal Transduction", "Spleen", "Th2 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lee S", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "Heriberto", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "Vasilena", "Last Name": "Gocheva", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, New York, New York 10065."}, {"First Name": "Vladislav", "Last Name": "Tsiperson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "Fayyaz S", "Last Name": "Sutterwala", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52241."}, {"First Name": "Johanna A", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, New York, New York 10065."}, {"First Name": "Bianca V", "Last Name": "Gapp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Vincent A", "Last Name": "Blomen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Kartik", "Last Name": "Chandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "Thijn R", "Last Name": "Brummelkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Netherlands Cancer Institute, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Felipe", "Last Name": "Diaz-Griffero", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461."}, {"First Name": "J\u00fcrgen", "Last Name": "Brojatsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.
