It is known that calcium-binding domains, including helix-loop-helix EF hands and repeats-in-toxin (RTX) domains, can bind lanthanide ions due to their similar ionic radii and coordination preference to calcium. Recently, the lanmodulin protein from Methylorubrum extorquens was reported, which has evolved a high affinity for lanthanide ions over calcium. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophile, which has been explored for use in bioleaching for metal recovery. In this report, A. ferrooxidans was engineered for the recombinant intracellular expression of lanmodulin. In addition, an RTX domain from the adenylate cyclase protein of Bordetella pertussis, which has previously been shown to bind Tb3+, was expressed periplasmically via fusion with the endogenous rusticyanin protein. The binding of lanthanides (Tb3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, and La3+) was improved by up to 4-fold for cells expressing lanmodulin and 13-fold for cells expressing the RTX domains in both pure and mixed metal solutions. Interestingly, the presence of lanthanides in the growth media enhanced protein expression, likely by influencing protein stability. Both engineered cell lines exhibited higher recoveries and selectivities for four tested lanthanides (Tb3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, and La3+) over non-REEs (Fe2+ and Co2+) in a synthetic magnet leachate, demonstrating the potential of these new strains for future REE reclamation and recycling applications.", "Keywords": ["Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans", "RTX domain", "biomining", "lanmodulin", "lanthanides", "rare-earth elements"], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium", "Metals, Rare Earth", "Acidithiobacillus", "Lanthanoid Series Elements", "Ions"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heejung", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zihang", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuta", "Last Name": "Inaba", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alan C", "Last Name": "West", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Banta", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "Environmental science & technology", "PubDate": "2023Dec05"}, {"PMID": "37658768", "Title": "Engineering Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase for activity with the non-canonical cofactor 3'-NADP(H).", "Abstract": "Oxidoreductases catalyze essential redox reactions, and many require a diffusible cofactor for electron transport, such as NAD(H).

The supercomplex of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS) is an ideal example of the controlled transport of intermediates via electrostatic channeling. Here, using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a Markov state model (MSM), we examined the transport process of the intermediate oxaloacetate (OAA) from MDH to CS. The MSM enables the identification of the dominant transport pathways of OAA from MDH to CS. Analysis of all pathways using a hub score approach reveals a small set of residues that control OAA transport. This set includes an arginine residue previously identified experimentally. MSM analysis of a mutated complex, where the identified arginine is replaced by alanine, led to a 2-fold decrease in transfer efficiency, also consistent with experimental results.

The apparent parameters estimated in this manner are unlikely to capture the full catalytic performance of these enzymes. In this study, we derive a mechanistic rate law describing FLS activity as well as theory-based figures of merit to rank FLS performance under relevant conditions.

In 1977, the kinetics of native pigeon liver NADK were thoroughly investigated, and it was reported to exhibit reversible activity, such that ATP and NAD+ can be formed from ADP and NADP+. We hypothesized that the reverse activity of the pigeon enzyme may enable compensation of the high picolinic acid carboxylase (PC) activity present in pigeon livers, which inhibits NAD+ biosynthesis from dietary tryptophan. Here, we report the characterization of four recombinantly expressed NADKs and explore their reversible activities. Duck and cat livers have higher PC activity than pigeon livers, and the recombinant duck and cat NADKs exhibit high activity in the reverse direction. The human NADK has an affinity for NAD+ that is \u223c600 times higher than the pigeon, duck, and cat isoforms, and we conclude that NAD+ serves as a potent product inhibitor for the reverse activity of the human NADK, which accounts for the observed irreversible behavior.

The oxidation of dispersed sulfur can lower the culture pH within days below the range where aerobic ferrous iron oxidation can occur. Thus, ferric iron reduction can be observed quickly which had previously been reported over extended incubation periods with untreated sulfur. Therefore, we demonstrate that this substrate utilization pattern is strongly dependent on the cell loading in relation to sulfur concentration, sulfur surface hydrophobicity, and the pH of the culture.

Acidic medium with iron, chloride, low sulfate, and pyrite supplementation created an environment where unstable thiosulfate was continuously generated.

A common approach is the mutagenesis of amino acids involved in interactions with the 2'-phosphate group of NADP(H) in the cofactor binding pocket. We recently performed a 'loop-grafting' approach to engineer the substrate specificity of the thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase D (AdhD) from Pyrococcus furiosus and we found that a loop insertion after residue 211, which is on the back side of the cofactor binding pocket, could also alter cofactor specificity. Here, we further explore this approach by introducing single point mutations and single amino acid insertions at the loop insertion site. Six different mutants of AdhD were created by either converting glycine 211 to cysteine or serine or by inserting alanine, serine, glycine or cysteine between the 211 and 212 residues. Several mutants gained activity with NADP+ above the wild-type enzyme. And remarkably, it was found that all of the mutants investigated resulted in some degree of reversal of cofactor specificity in the oxidative direction. These changes were generally a result of changes in conformations of the ternary enzyme/cofactor/substrate complexes as opposed to changes in affinities or binding energies of the cofactors. This study highlights the role that amino acids which are distal to the cofactor binding pocket but are involved in substrate interactions can influence cofactor specificity in AdhD, and this strategy should translate to other AKR family members.", "Keywords": ["alcohol dehydrogenase", "aldo-keto reductases", "cofactor specificity", "site-directed mutagenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohol Dehydrogenase", "Archaeal Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Coenzymes", "Humans", "Mutation", "NADP", "Pyrococcus furiosus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kusum", "Last Name": "Solanki", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walaa", "Last Name": "Abdallah", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Banta", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS", "PubDate": "2017May01"}, {"PMID": "28185883", "Title": "Development of reactor configurations for an electrofuels platform utilizing genetically modified iron oxidizing bacteria for the reduction of CO2 to biochemicals.", "Abstract": "Electrofuels processes are potentially promising platforms for biochemical production from CO2 using renewable energy.

The peptide isolated from the RTX domain is intrinsically disordered in the absence of calcium. In calcium rich environments, the peptide binds Ca(2+) ions and folds into a beta roll (\u03b2-roll) secondary structure composed to two parallel \u03b2-sheet faces. Previously, we mutated one of the faces to contain solvent exposed leucine side chains which are localized only in the calcium-bound \u03b2-roll conformation. We demonstrated the ability of this mutant peptide to self-assemble into hydrogels in the presence of calcium with the aid of additional peptide-based cross-linking moieties. Here, we have expanded this approach by engineering both \u03b2-roll faces to contain leucine residues, thereby doubling the cross-linking interface for each monomeric building block. These leucine rich surfaces impart a hydrophobic driving force for self-assembly. Extensive characterization was performed on this double-faced mutant to ensure the retention of calcium affinity and subsequent structural rearrangement similar to that of the wild type domain. We genetically fused an \u03b1-helical leucine zipper capable of forming tetrameric coiled-coil bundles to the peptide and the resulting chimeric protein self-assembles into a hydrogel only in calcium rich environments. Since this new mutant peptide enables cross-linking on both surfaces simultaneously, a higher oligomerization state was achieved. To further investigate the cross-linking capability, we constructed concatemers of the \u03b2-roll with maltose binding protein (MBP), a monomeric globular protein, without the leucine zipper domains. These concatemers show a similar sol-gel transition in response to calcium. Several biophysical techniques were used to probe the structural and mechanical properties of the mutant \u03b2-roll domain and the resulting supramolecular networks including circular dichroism, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, bis-ANS binding, and microrheology.

In higher iron media a similar trend was observed at low pH, but the formation of precipitates at higher pH (2.0) hampered cell growth and lowered the specific growth rate and maximum cell yield. In order to eliminate ferric precipitates, chelating agents were introduced into the medium. Citric acid was found to be relatively non-toxic and did not appear to interfere with iron oxidation at a maximum concentration of 70\u2009mM. Inclusion of citric acid prevented precipitation and A. ferrooxidans growth parameters resumed their trends as a function of pH. The addition of citrate also decreased the apparent substrate saturation constant (KS ) indicating a reduction in the competitive inhibition of growth by ferric ions.

A key premise of this work is that cTnC and cTnT, owing to their innate ability to bind cTnI, are potential templates for the design and discovery of cTnI-binding peptides. Relying only on the knowledge of primary sequences of cTnC and cTnT, we designed a library of short overlapping peptides that span the entirety of cTnC and cTnT and tested them for binding to cTnI. We were successful in identifying several peptides that display high affinity (1-100 nM) for cTnI. The specific implication of this work is that mimicking natural protein-protein interactions is an excellent starting point for the discovery and rational design of peptide ligands. The knowledge of secondary or tertiary structures of the proteins involved is not a necessary precondition for this approach. Nevertheless, we show that structural information can be used to validate the results of a fragment-based peptide design, and can be potentially beneficial for refining the lead candidates.

Here, we further examine the modularity of these loops by grafting those from human aldose reductase (hAR) into the hyperthermostable AKR, alcohol dehydrogenase D (AdhD), from Pyrococcus furiosus. Replacement of Loops A and B was sufficient to impart hAR activity into AdhD, and the resulting chimera retained the thermostability of the parent enzyme. However, no active chimeras were observed when the hAR loops were grafted into a previously engineered cofactor specificity mutant of AdhD, which displayed similar kinetics to hAR with the model substrate dl-glyceraldehyde. The non-additivity of these mutations suggests that efficient turnover is more dependent on the relative positioning of the cofactor and substrate in the active site than on binding of the individual species.

The calcium-responsive beta roll-forming repeats in toxin (RTX) domain potentially offer both of these properties. To further develop this scaffold, we synthesized a set of RTX peptides ranging in size from 5 to 17 repeats, with and without C-terminal capping. We found that while the number of repeats can be altered to tune the size of the RTX face, repeat ordering and C-terminal capping are critical for successful folding. Comparing all of the constructs, we also observed that native configuration with nine repeats exhibited the highest affinity for calcium. In addition, we performed a comparison on a set of known RTX-containing proteins and find that C-terminal repeats often possess deviations from the consensus RTX sequence which may be essential for proper folding. We further find that there seems to be a narrow size range in which RTX domains exist. These results demonstrate that the deviations from the consensus RTX sequence that are observed in natural proteins are important for high-affinity calcium binding and folding.
