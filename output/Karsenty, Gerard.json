In this study, we first show that aerobic exercise increases the expression of Il6r in bones of WT mice. Then, we analyzed a mutant mouse strain that lacks the IL-6 receptor alpha specifically in osteoblasts (Il6rosb-/-).

In contrast, Il6rosb-/- mice that were subjected to aerobic exercise did not show the increase in bone mass and remodeling parameters that control littermates demonstrated. Moreover, Il6rosb-/- mice undergoing aerobic exercise showed a severe impairment in bone formation, indicating that activation of bone-forming cells is defective when IL-6 signaling in osteoblasts is disrupted.

Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PTP1B in mice (PTP1B cKO mice) caused a hypertrophic phenotype that was exacerbated by pressure overload. Furthermore, we showed that argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, was a substrate of PTP1B in cardiomyocytes and in the heart. Our results revealed that phosphorylation at Tyr393 and inactivation of AGO2 in PTP1B cKO mice prevented miR-208b-mediated repression of thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 1 (THRAP1; also known as MED13) and contributed to thyroid hormone-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. In support of this conclusion, inhibiting the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) with propylthiouracil rescued pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and improved myocardial contractility and systolic function in PTP1B cKO mice.

These effects of clenbuterol were attenuated in M-PDK1KO mice, and mechanical load-induced activation of the S6K-S6 axis and muscle hypertrophy were inhibited in mice with skeletal muscle-specific deficiency of \u03b22-AR. Our results suggest that PDK1 regulates skeletal muscle mass under the static condition and that it contributes to mechanical load-induced muscle hypertrophy, at least in part by mediating signaling from \u03b22-AR.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Clenbuterol", "Hypertrophy", "Insulin", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2", "Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naoki", "Last Name": "Kuramoto", "Affiliation": "Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kazuhiro", "Last Name": "Nomura", "Affiliation": "Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Daisuke", "Last Name": "Kohno", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Signal Research Center, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tadahiro", "Last Name": "Kitamura", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Signal Research Center, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Gerard", "Last Name": "Karsenty", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tetsuya", "Last Name": "Hosooka", "Affiliation": "Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Wataru", "Last Name": "Ogawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan. ogawa@med.kobe-u.ac.jp."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Feb10"}, {"PMID": "33378272", "Title": "ARDD 2020: from aging mechanisms to interventions.", "Abstract": "Aging is emerging as a druggable target with growing interest from academia, industry and investors.

A significant reduction in \u03b2-cell proliferation rates, \u03b2-cell areas, and blood insulin concentrations was detected in Adipoq -/- mice at midpregnancy. Surprisingly, conditionally knocking down adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) or AdipoR2 genes in \u03b2-cells during pregnancy did not reduce \u03b2-cell proliferation rates or blood insulin concentrations. In vitro adiponectin treatment also failed to show any effect on \u03b2-cell proliferation of isolated pancreatic islets. It was reported that placental lactogen (PL) plays a crucial role in pregnancy-induced maternal \u03b2-cell proliferation. A significant decrease in phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, a downstream molecule of PL signaling, was observed in islets from Adipoq -/- dams. The mRNA levels of mouse PL genes were robustly decreased in the placentas of Adipoq -/- dams. In contrast, adiponectin treatment increased PL expression in human placenta explants and JEG3 trophoblast cells. Most importantly, bovine PL injection restored \u03b2-cell proliferation and blood insulin concentrations in Adipoq -/- dams.

This question was rejuvenated in the late 1990s and early 2000s years when the application of mouse genetics made it feasible to test whether there were new endocrine determinants of bone (re)modeling. Addressing this question, taking into account fundamental cell biology features of bone led to the hypothesis that there should be a coordinated control of bone growth/mass, energy metabolism, and reproduction. Testing genetically and molecularly, this hypothesis revealed that, in vivo, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is a powerful inhibitor of bone mass accrual following its signaling in the brain.

Two distinct subsets of ILC2s have been described: steady-state natural ILC2s and inflammatory ILC2s, which are elicited following helminth infection. However, how tissue-specific cues regulate these two subsets of ILC2s and their effector functions remains elusive. Here, we report that interleukin-33 (IL-33) promotes the generation of inflammatory ILC2s (ILC2INFLAM) via induction of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1). Tph1 expression was upregulated in ILC2s upon activation with IL-33 or following helminth infection in an IL-33-dependent manner.

Circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels surge during exercise and IL-6 favors exercise capacity. However, neither the cellular origin of circulating IL-6 during exercise nor the means by which this cytokine enhances exercise capacity has been formally established yet. Here we show through genetic means that the majority of circulating IL-6 detectable during exercise originates from muscle and that to increase exercise capacity, IL-6 must signal in osteoblasts to favor osteoclast differentiation and the release of bioactive osteocalcin in the general circulation. This explains why mice lacking the IL-6 receptor only in osteoblasts exhibit a deficit in exercise capacity of similar severity to the one seen in mice lacking muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6), and why this deficit is correctable by osteocalcin but not by IL-6. Furthermore, in agreement with the notion that IL-6 acts through osteocalcin, we demonstrate that mIL-6 promotes nutrient uptake and catabolism into myofibers during exercise in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the crosstalk between osteocalcin and IL-6 is conserved between rodents and humans.

In serum, OCN exists in carboxylated and uncarboxylated forms (ucOCN), and studies in rodents suggest that ucOCN is the bioactive form of this hormone. Whether this is also the case in humans is unclear, because a reliable assay to measure ucOCN is not available. Here, we established and validated a new immunoassay (ELISA) measuring human ucOCN and used it to determine the level of bioactive OCN in two cohorts of overweight or obese subjects, with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). The ELISA could specifically detect ucOCN concentrations ranging from 0.037 to 1.8 ng/mL. In a first cohort of overweight or obese postmenopausal women without diabetes (n = 132), ucOCN correlated negatively with fasting glucose (r\u2009=\u2009-0.18, P = 0.042) and insulin resistance assessed by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (r\u2009=\u2009-0.18, P = 0.038) and positively with insulin sensitivity assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (r\u2009=\u20090.18, P = 0.043) or insulin sensitivity index derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (r\u2009=\u20090.26, P = 0.003).

Moreover, the subjects with ucOCN levels below 3 ng/mL had a reduced insulin secretion rate during a hyperglycemic clamp (P = 0.03).

The bone-specific protein osteocalcin (OCN) is an established marker of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) osteochondrogenic transdifferentiation and a known regulator of glucose metabolism. However, the role of OCN in controlling arterial calcification is unclear. We hypothesized that OCN regulates calcification in VSMCs and sought to identify the underpinning signaling pathways. Immunohistochemistry revealed OCN co-localization with VSMC calcification in human calcified carotid artery plaques. Additionally, 3\u2009mM phosphate treatment stimulated OCN mRNA expression in cultured VSMCs (1.72-fold, p <\u20090.001). Phosphate-induced calcification was blunted in VSMCs derived from OCN null mice (Ocn -/- ) compared with cells derived from wild-type (WT) mice (0.37-fold, p <\u20090.001). Ocn -/- VSMCs showed reduced mRNA expression of the osteogenic marker Runx2 (0.51-fold, p <\u20090.01) and the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, PiT1 (0.70-fold, p <\u20090.001), with an increase in the calcification inhibitor Mgp (1.42-fold, p <\u20090.05) compared with WT. Ocn -/- VSMCs also showed reduced mRNA expression of Axin2 (0.13-fold, p <\u20090.001) and Cyclin D (0.71 fold, p <\u20090.01), markers of Wnt signaling. CHIR99021 (GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor) treatment increased calcium deposition in WT and Ocn -/- VSMCs (1\u2009\u03bcM, p <\u20090.001). Ocn -/- VSMCs, however, calcified less than WT cells (1\u2009\u03bcM; 0.27-fold, p <\u20090.001). Ocn -/- VSMCs showed reduced mRNA expression of Glut1 (0.78-fold, p <\u20090.001), Hex1 (0.77-fold, p <\u20090.01), and Pdk4 (0.47-fold, p <\u20090.001). This was accompanied by reduced glucose uptake (0.38-fold, p <\u20090.05). Subsequent mitochondrial function assessment revealed increased ATP-linked respiration (1.29-fold, p <\u20090.05), spare respiratory capacity (1.59-fold, p <\u20090.01), and maximal respiration (1.52-fold, p <\u20090.001) in Ocn -/- versus WT VSMCs. Together these data suggest that OCN plays a crucial role in arterial calcification mediated by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling through reduced maximal respiration.

In this study, we used carcinogen treatment in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 knockout (Tph1KO) and transgenic (Tph1fl/fl VillinCre ) mouse models defective in 5-HT synthesis to investigate the early mutagenic events associated with CRT. Our observations of the colonic crypt post-treatment followed a timeline designed to understand how disruption of 5-HT synthesis affects the initial steps leading to CRT. We found Tph1KO mice had decreased development of both allograft tumors and colitis-related CRT. Interestingly, carcinogenic exposure alone induced multiple colon tumors and increased cyclooxygenase-2 (Ptgs2) expression in Tph1KO mice. Deletion of interleukin 6 (Il6) in Tph1KO mice confirmed that inflammation was a part of the process. 5-HT deficiency increased colonic DNA damage but inhibited genetic repair of specific carcinogen-related damage, leading to CRT-related inflammatory reactions and dysplasia. To validate a secondary effect of 5-HT deficiency on another DNA repair pathway, we exposed Tph1KO mice to ionizing radiation and found an increase in DNA damage associated with reduced levels of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (Atr) gene expression in colonocytes. Restoring 5-HT levels with 5-hydroxytryptophan treatment decreased levels of DNA damage and increased Atr expression.

Defective osteoclast activity leads to osteopetrosis and bone marrow failure1-9, whereas excess activity can contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis10. Osteopetrosis can be partially treated by bone marrow transplantation in humans and mice11-18, consistent with a haematopoietic origin of osteoclasts13,16,19 and studies that\u00a0suggest that they develop by fusion of monocytic precursors derived from haematopoietic stem cells in the presence of CSF1 and RANK ligand1,20. However, the developmental origin and lifespan of osteoclasts, and the mechanisms that ensure maintenance of osteoclast function throughout life in vivo remain largely unexplored. Here we report that osteoclasts that colonize fetal ossification centres originate from embryonic erythro-myeloid progenitors21,22. These erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived osteoclasts are required for normal bone development and tooth eruption. Yet, timely transfusion of haematopoietic-stem-cell-derived monocytic cells in newborn mice is sufficient to rescue bone development in early-onset autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. We also found that the postnatal maintenance of osteoclasts, bone mass and the bone marrow cavity involve iterative fusion of circulating blood monocytic cells with long-lived osteoclast syncytia. As a consequence, parabiosis or transfusion of monocytic cells results in long-term gene transfer in osteoclasts in the absence of haematopoietic-stem-cell chimerism, and can rescue an adult-onset osteopetrotic phenotype caused by cathepsin K deficiency23,24. In sum, our results identify the developmental origin of osteoclasts and a mechanism that controls their maintenance in bones after birth.

Moreover, live-cell imaging directly demonstrated that Merkel cells mediate activity- and VMAT-dependent release of fluorescent catecholamine neurotransmitter analogs.

The gut is colonized by trillions of bacteria that regulate host production of several signaling molecules including serotonin (5-HT) and other hormones and neurotransmitters. Approximately 90% of 5-HT originates from the intestine, and activation of the 5-HT4 receptor in the ENS has been linked to adult neurogenesis and neuroprotection. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could induce maturation of the adult ENS through release of 5-HT and activation of 5-HT4 receptors. Colonization of germ-free mice with a microbiota from conventionally raised mice modified the neuroanatomy of the ENS and increased intestinal transit rates, which was associated with neuronal and mucosal 5-HT production and the proliferation of enteric neuronal progenitors in the adult intestine. Pharmacological modulation of the 5-HT4 receptor, as well as depletion of endogenous 5-HT, identified a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and maturation of the adult ENS through the release of 5-HT and activation of the 5-HT4 receptor. Taken together, these findings show that the microbiota modulates the anatomy of the adult ENS in a 5-HT-dependent fashion with concomitant changes in intestinal transit.", "Keywords": ["5-HT4R", "enteric nervous system", "microbiota", "serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Enteric Nervous System", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Intestine, Small", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microbiota", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT4", "Serotonin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Filipe", "Last Name": "De Vadder", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg, 41345 Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Estelle", "Last Name": "Grasset", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg, 41345 Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Louise", "Last Name": "Manner\u00e5s Holm", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg, 41345 Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "G\u00e9rard", "Last Name": "Karsenty", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Macpherson", "Affiliation": "Maurice M\u00fcller Laboratories, Departement Klinische Forschung, Universit\u00e4tsklinik f\u00fcr Viszerale Chirurgie und Medizin Inselspital, University of Bern, 3008 Bern, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Louise E", "Last Name": "Olofsson", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg, 41345 Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Fredrik", "Last Name": "B\u00e4ckhed", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg, 41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; fredrik.backhed@wlab.gu.se."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2018Jun19"}, {"PMID": "29376523", "Title": "Osteocalcin in the brain: from embryonic development to age-related decline in cognition.", "Abstract": "A remarkable, unexpected aspect of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin is that it is necessary for both brain development and brain function in the mouse, as its absence results in a profound deficit in spatial learning and memory and an exacerbation of anxiety-like behaviour.

Bone through the hormone osteocalcin, promotes exercise capacity in the mouse. After binding to a G-coupled protein receptor, Gprc6a, osteocalcin increases nutrients uptake and catabolism in myofibers during exercise.

These data suggest the existence of a negative regulation of this cross talk between OCN and insulin. Recently, we identified delta like-1 (DLK1) as an endocrine regulator of bone turnover. Because DLK1 is colocalized with insulin in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, we examined the role of DLK1 in insulin signaling in OBs and energy metabolism. We show that Glu-OCN specifically stimulates Dlk1 expression by the pancreas.

However, the function of JMJD3 in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that JMJD3 is highly expressed in cells of the chondrocyte lineage, especially in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, during endochondral ossification. Homozygous deletion of Jmjd3 results in severely decreased proliferation and delayed hypertrophy of chondrocytes, and thereby marked retardation of endochondral ossification in mice.

During pregnancy, 5-HT increases \u03b2-cell proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) through the G\u03b1q-coupled 5-HT2b receptor (Htr2b) and the 5-HT3 receptor (Htr3), a ligand-gated cation channel, respectively. However, the role of 5-HT in \u03b2-cell function in an insulin-resistant state has yet to be elucidated. Here, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of \u03b2-cell-specific Htr2b(-/-) (Htr2b \u03b2KO), Htr3a(-/-) (Htr3a knock-out [KO]), and \u03b2-cell-specific tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1)(-/-) (Tph1 \u03b2KO) mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). Htr2b \u03b2KO, Htr3a KO, and Tph1 \u03b2KO mice exhibited normal glucose tolerance on a standard chow diet.

Pancreas perfusion assays revealed defective first-phase insulin secretion in Htr3a KO mice. GSIS was impaired in islets isolated from HFD-fed Htr3a KO and Tph1 \u03b2KO mice, and 5-HT treatment improved insulin secretion from Tph1 \u03b2KO islets but not from Htr3a KO islets.

Systemic and local skeletal factors such as receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba-B ligand (RANKL), PTHrP, calcitonin, and estrogen are known to regulate bone remodeling during and after lactation. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) may function as an endocrine factor to regulate body composition changes during lactation by inducing gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we hypothesized that the metabolic changes during lactation were due in part to increased circulating FGF-21, which in turn could accentuate bone loss. We longitudinally characterized body composition in C57BL/6J (B6) mice during (day 7 and day 21 of lactation) and after normal lactation (day 21 postlactation). At day 7 of lactation, areal bone density declined by 10% (P < .001), bone resorption increased (P < .0001), percent fat decreased by 20%, energy expenditure increased (P < .01), and markers of brown-like adipogenesis were suppressed in the inguinal depot and in preformed brown adipose tissue. At day 7 of lactation there was a 2.4-fold increase in serum FGF-21 vs baseline (P < .0001), a 8-fold increase in hepatic FGF-21 mRNA (P < .03), a 2-fold increase in undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu13 OCn) (P < .01), and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Recovery of total areal bone density was noted at day 21 of lactation, whereas the femoral trabecular bone volume fraction was still reduced (P < .01). Because FGF-21 levels rose rapidly at day 7 of lactation in B6 lactating mice, we next examined lactating mice with a deletion in the Fgf21 gene. Trabecular and cortical bone masses were maintained throughout lactation in FGF-21(-/-) mice, and pup growth was normal. Compared with lactating control mice, lactating FGF-21(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in bone formation, but no change in bone resorption.

We determined that the severity of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance that mice develop when fed a HFD is in part a consequence of osteoblast-dependent insulin resistance.

To identify the signaling pathways in osteoblasts that mediate insulin's effects on bone and energy metabolism, we examined the function of the tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) protein, a key target important in coordinating nutrient signaling. Here, we show that loss of Tsc2 in osteoblasts constitutively activates mTOR and destabilizes Irs1, causing osteoblasts to differentiate poorly and become resistant to insulin. Young Tsc2 mutant mice demonstrate hypoglycemia with increased levels of insulin and undercarboxylated osteocalcin. However, with age, Tsc2 mutants develop metabolic features similar to mice lacking the insulin receptor in the osteoblast, including peripheral adiposity, hyperglycemia, and decreased pancreatic \u03b2 cell mass.

Through the secretion of an osteoblast-derived molecule, osteocalcin, the skeleton regulates glucose homeostasis and male reproductive functions. When undercarboxylated, osteocalcin acts following its binding to a G-coupled receptor, Gprc6a, on pancreatic \u03b2 cells to increase insulin secretion, on muscle and white adipose tissue to promote glucose homeostasis and on Leydig cells of the testis to favor testosterone biosynthesis. More recently, it was also shown that osteocalcin acts via a pancreas-bone-testis axis that regulates, independently of and in parallel to the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, male reproductive functions by promoting testosterone biosynthesis. Lastly, in trying to expand the biological relevance of osteocalcin from mouse to human, it was shown that Gprc6a is a potential new susceptibility locus for primary testicular failure in humans.

As seen in Runx2(-/-) mice, perinatal lethality was observed in \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, but this was not the case in animals in which \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre was used to delete Runx2. When using double-staining with Alizarin red for mineralized matrix and Alcian blue for cartilaginous matrix, we observed previously that mineralization was totally absent at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) throughout the body in Runx2(-/-) mice, but was found in areas undergoing intramembranous ossification such as skull and clavicles in \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice. In newborn \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, mineralization impairment was restricted to skeletal areas undergoing endochondral ossification including long bones and vertebrae. In contrast, no apparent skeletal abnormalities were seen in mutant embryo, newborn, and 3-week-old to 6-week old-mice in which Runx2 had been deleted with the \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre driver. These results suggest that Runx2 is absolutely required for endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal skeletogenesis, but that disrupting its expression in already committed osteoblasts as achieved here with the \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre driver does not affect overtly intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The Runx2 floxed allele established here is undoubtedly useful for investigating the role of Runx2 in particular cells.", "Keywords": ["CHONDROCYTE", "CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUT", "OSTEOBLAST", "RUNX2", "SKELETOGENESIS"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Development", "Chondrocytes", "Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit", "Female", "Integrases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Osteoblasts", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Takarada", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University Graduate School, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Eiichi", "Last Name": "Hinoi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryota", "Last Name": "Nakazato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroki", "Last Name": "Ochi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Azusa", "Last Name": "Tsuchikane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shu", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerard", "Last Name": "Karsenty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takaya", "Last Name": "Abe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Kiyonari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yukio", "Last Name": "Yoneda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23395800", "Title": "The transcription factor early B-cell factor 1 regulates bone formation in an osteoblast-nonautonomous manner.", "Abstract": "Early B-cell factor 1 (Ebf1) is a transcription factor whose inactivation in all cells results in high bone mass because of an increase in bone formation.

The active form of vitamin D [1\u03b1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] binds and activates its specific nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Activated VDR prevents the release of calcium from its storage in bone to serum by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption and renal reabsorption. However, the direct action of VDR in bone tissue is poorly understood because serum Ca(2+) homeostasis is maintained through tightly regulated ion transport by the kidney, intestine, and bone. In addition, conventional genetic approaches using VDR knockout (VDR-KO, VDR(-/-)) mice could not identify VDR action in bone because of the animals' systemic defects in calcium metabolism. In this study, we report that systemic VDR heterozygous KO (VDR(+/L-)) mice generated with the Cre/loxP system as well as conventional VDR heterozygotes (VDR(+/-)) showed increased bone mass in radiological assessments. Because mineral metabolism parameters were unaltered in both types of mice, these bone phenotypes imply that skeletal VDR plays a role in bone mass regulation. To confirm this assumption, osteoblast-specific VDR-KO (VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob)) mice were generated with 2.3 kb \u03b11(I)-collagen promoter-Cre transgenic mice. They showed a bone mass increase without any dysregulation of mineral metabolism. Although bone formation parameters were not affected in bone histomorphometry, bone resorption was obviously reduced in VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob) mice because of decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (an essential molecule in osteoclastogenesis) in VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob) osteoblasts.

Recently, however, several reports revealed novel and unique roles for MAML1 that are independent of the Notch signaling pathway. We found that MAML1 enhances the transcriptional activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a transcription factor essential for osteoblastic differentiation and chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. MAML1 significantly enhanced the Runx2-mediated transcription of the p6OSE2-Luc reporter, in which luciferase expression was controlled by six copies of the osteoblast specific element 2 (OSE2) from the Runx2-regulated osteocalcin gene promoter. Interestingly, a deletion mutant of MAML1 lacking the N-terminal Notch-binding domain also enhanced Runx2-mediated transcription. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling did not affect the action of MAML1 on Runx2, suggesting that the activation of Runx2 by MAML1 may be caused in a Notch-independent manner. Overexpression of MAML1 transiently enhanced the Runx2-mediated expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, in the murine pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2. MAML1(-/-) embryos at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) had shorter bone lengths than wild-type embryos. The area of primary spongiosa of the femoral diaphysis was narrowed. At E14.5, extended zone of collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1) and Sox9 expression, markers of chondrocyte differentiation, and decreased zone of collagen type X alpha 1 (Col10a1) expression, a marker of hypertrophic chondrocyte, were observed.
