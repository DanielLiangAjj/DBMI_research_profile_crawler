PG forms an extracellular polymer crucial for cellular viability, the synthesis of which is the target of many antibiotics. PG assembly requires a glycosyltransferase (GT) to generate a glycan polymer using a Lipid II substrate, which is then crosslinked to the existing PG via a transpeptidase (TP) reaction. A Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) GT enzyme and a Class B Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) form the core of the multi-protein complex required for PG assembly. Here we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cell elongation-specific E. coli RodA-PBP2 complex. We combine this information with biochemical, genetic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses to identify the Lipid II binding sites and propose a mechanism for Lipid II polymerization.

Subpopulations of persister cells are metabolically quiescent, a state associated with delayed growth, reduced protein synthesis, and increased tolerance to antibiotics. Serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases similar to those found in eukaryotes can fine-tune essential bacterial cellular processes, such as metabolism and stress signaling. We found that acid stress-mimicking conditions that S. aureus experiences in host tissues delayed growth, globally altered the serine and threonine phosphoproteome, and increased threonine phosphorylation of the activation loop of the serine-threonine protein kinase B (PknB). The deletion of stp, which encodes the only annotated functional serine-threonine phosphatase in S. aureus, increased the growth delay and phenotypic heterogeneity under different stress challenges, including growth in acidic conditions, the intracellular milieu of human cells, and abscesses in mice. This growth delay was associated with reduced protein translation and intracellular ATP concentrations and increased antibiotic tolerance. Using phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified targets of serine-threonine phosphorylation that may regulate bacterial growth and metabolism.

A major challenge of this state is how to preserve ribosomes for the return to favorable conditions. Here, we show that the ribosome dimerization protein hibernation-promoting factor (HPF) functions to protect essential ribosomal proteins. Ribosomes isolated from strains lacking HPF (\u0394hpf) or encoding a mutant allele of HPF that binds the ribosome but does not mediate dimerization were substantially depleted of the small subunit proteins S2 and S3. Strikingly, these proteins are located directly at the ribosome dimer interface. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to further characterize these ribosomes and observed that a high percentage of ribosomes were missing S2, S3, or both. These data support a model in which the ribosome dimerization activity of HPF evolved to protect labile proteins that are essential for ribosome function. HPF is almost universally conserved in bacteria, and HPF deletions in diverse species exhibit decreased viability during starvation. Our data provide mechanistic insight into this phenotype and establish a mechanism for how HPF protects ribosomes during quiescence.IMPORTANCE The formation of ribosome dimers during periods of dormancy is widespread among bacteria. Dimerization is typically mediated by a single protein, hibernation-promoting factor (HPF). Bacteria lacking HPF exhibit strong defects in viability and pathogenesis and, in some species, extreme loss of rRNA. The mechanistic basis of these phenotypes has not been determined. Here, we report that HPF from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis preserves ribosomes by preventing the loss of essential ribosomal proteins at the dimer interface. This protection may explain phenotypes associated with the loss of HPF, since ribosome protection would aid survival during nutrient limitation and impart a strong selective advantage when the bacterial cell rapidly reinitiates growth in the presence of sufficient nutrients.", "Keywords": ["stationary phase", "translation"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacillus subtilis", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Dimerization", "Ribosome Subunits, Small", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heather A", "Last Name": "Feaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mykhailo", "Last Name": "Kopylov", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenny Kim", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marko", "Last Name": "Jovanovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA jonathan.dworkin@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of bacteriology", "PubDate": "2020Apr27"}, {"PMID": "31862457", "Title": "Clickable methionine as a universal probe for labelling intracellular bacteria.", "Abstract": "Despite their clinical and biological importance, the cell biology of obligate intracellular bacteria is less well understood than that of many free-living model organisms.

However, phosphoproteomic surveys over the past decade in phylogenetically diverse bacteria have identified numerous proteins that are phosphorylated on Ser and/or Thr residues. Consistently, genes encoding Ser/Thr kinases are present in many bacterial genomes, such as that of Escherichia coli, which encodes at least three Ser/Thr kinases. Since Ser/Thr phosphorylation is a stable modification, a dedicated phosphatase is necessary to allow reversible regulation. Ser/Thr phosphatases belonging to several conserved families are found in bacteria. One family of particular interest are Ser/Thr phosphatases, which have extensive sequence and structural homology to eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) phosphatases. These proteins, called eukaryote-like Ser/Thr phosphatases (eSTPs), have been identified in a number of bacteria but not in E. coli Here, we describe a previously unknown eSTP encoded by an E. coli open reading frame (ORF), yegK, and characterize its biochemical properties, including its kinetics, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to known phosphatase inhibitors. We investigate differences in the activity of this protein in closely related E. coli strains. Finally, we demonstrate that this eSTP acts to dephosphorylate a novel Ser/Thr kinase that is encoded in the same operon.IMPORTANCE Regulatory protein phosphorylation is a conserved mechanism of signaling in all biological systems. Recent phosphoproteomic analyses of phylogenetically diverse bacteria, including the model Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, demonstrate that many proteins are phosphorylated on serine or threonine residues. In contrast to phosphorylation on histidine or aspartate residues, phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues is stable and requires the action of a partner Ser/Thr phosphatase to remove the modification. Although a number of Ser/Thr kinases have been reported in E. coli, no partner Ser/Thr phosphatases have been identified.

Thus, how can a metabolically quiescent cell accurately monitor environmental conditions in order to best decide when to exit dormancy? One strategy employed by microbes to deal with changing environments is the generation of phenotypes that may be less well adapted to a current condition but might confer an advantage in the future. This bet-hedging depends on phenotypic diversity in the population, which itself can derive from naturally occurring stochastic differences in gene expression. In the case of metabolic dormancy, a bet-hedging strategy that has been proposed is the \"scout model\" where cells comprising a fraction of the dormant population reinitiate growth stochastically, independent of environmental cues. Here, we provide experimental evidence that such a mechanism exists in dormant spores produced by the ubiquitous soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We observe that these spores reinitiate growth at a low but measureable frequency even in the absence of an inducing signal. This phenomenon is the result of phenotypic variation in the propensity of individual spores to reinitiate growth spontaneously. Since this bet-hedging mechanism produces individuals that will either grow under favorable conditions or die under unfavorable conditions, a population can properly respond to environmental changes despite the impaired sensory ability of individual cells.", "Keywords": ["B.\u00a0subtilis", "cellular variability", "germination", "noise", "quiescence", "spore"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacillus subtilis", "Genetic Variation", "Phenotype", "Spores, Bacterial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Sturm", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Their role in bacterial physiology is not currently well understood in large part because the conditions where the eSTKs are active are generally not known. However, all sequenced Gram-positive bacteria have a highly conserved eSTK with extracellular PASTA repeats that bind cell wall derived muropeptides. Here, we report that in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the PASTA-containing eSTK PrkC and its cognate eSTP PrpC converge with the essential WalRK two-component system to regulate WalR regulon genes involved in cell wall metabolism. By continuously monitoring gene expression throughout growth, we consistently find a large PrkC-dependent effect on expression of several different WalR regulon genes in early stationary phase, including both those that are activated by WalR (yocH) as well as those that are repressed (iseA, pdaC). We demonstrate that PrkC phosphorylates WalR in vitro and in vivo on a single Thr residue located in the receiver domain. Although the phosphorylated region of the receiver domain is highly conserved among several B. subtilis response regulators, PrkC displays specificity for WalR in vitro. Consistently, strains expressing a nonphosphorylatable WalR point mutant strongly reduce both PrkC dependent activation and repression of yocH, iseA, and pdaC. This suggests a model where the eSTK PrkC regulates the essential WalRK two-component signaling system by direct phosphorylation of WalR Thr101, resulting in the regulation of WalR regulon genes involved in cell wall metabolism in stationary phase.

In addition, I will discuss how data from phosphoproteomic surveys suggest that Ser/Thr phosphorylation plays a much more significant physiological role than would be predicted simply based on in vivo and in vitro analyses of individual kinases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Wall", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Interestingly, isolated NTM infections (without disseminated NTM infection) have not been shown to be a good predictor of the presence of IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies. This case describes an isolated NTM empyema in a patient with IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies and makes the argument that the development of an NTM empyema in a patient with no known immunodeficiency should prompt consideration for IFN-\u03b3 testing. Additionally, this case underscores the importance for clinicians to recognize that an unusual infection without the typical cause of impairment in immunity should prompt a more thorough investigation of the patient's immune system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Autoantibodies", "Empyema", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Male", "Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Infection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas T", "Last Name": "DeLeon", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine Residency Program, John A.

However, in addition to these essential and well-studied functions, bacterial signaling by peptidoglycan fragments, or muropeptides, has been demonstrated by recent work. Actively growing bacteria release muropeptides as a consequence of cell wall remodeling during elongation and division. Therefore, the presence of muropeptide synthesis is indicative of growth-promoting conditions and may serve as a broadly conserved signal for nongrowing cells to reinitiate growth. In addition, muropeptides serve as signals between bacteria and eukaryotic organisms during both pathogenic and symbiotic interactions. The increasingly appreciated role of the microbiota in metazoan organisms suggests that muropeptide signaling likely has important implications for homeostatic mammalian physiology.", "Keywords": ["LysM domains", "PASTA domains", "metabolic quiescence", "quorum sensing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bacteria", "Bacterial Infections", "Humans", "Peptidoglycan", "Polysaccharides, Bacterial", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; email: jonathan.dworkin@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Annual review of microbiology", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "26082125", "Title": "Protein Targeting during Bacillus subtilis Sporulation.", "Abstract": "The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis initiates the formation of an endospore in response to conditions of nutrient limitation. The morphological differentiation that spores undergo initiates with the formation of an asymmetric septum near to one pole of the cell, forming a smaller compartment, the forespore, and a larger compartment, the mother cell. This process continues with the complex morphogenesis of the spore as governed by an intricate series of interactions between forespore and mother cell proteins across the inner and outer forespore membranes.

Protein assembly in the envelope of B. anthracis requires S-layer homology domains (SLH) within S-layer proteins and S-layer-associated proteins (BSLs), which associate with the secondary cell wall polysaccharide (SCWP), an acetylated carbohydrate that is tethered to peptidoglycan. Here, we investigated the contributions of two putative acetyltransferases, PatA1 and PatA2, on SCWP acetylation and S-layer assembly. We show that mutations in patA1 and patA2 affect the chain lengths of B. anthracis vegetative forms and perturb the deposition of the BslO murein hydrolase at cell division septa. The patA1 and patA2 mutants are defective for the assembly of EA1 in the envelope but retain the ability of S-layer formation with Sap. SCWP isolated from the patA1 patA2 mutant lacked acetyl moieties identified in wild-type polysaccharide and failed to associate with the SLH domains of EA1. A model is discussed whereby patA1- and patA2-mediated acetylation of SCWP enables the deposition of EA1 as well as BslO near the septal region of the B. anthracis envelope.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Acetyltransferases", "Bacillus anthracis", "Bacillus subtilis", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Wall", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mutation", "N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase", "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J Mark", "Last Name": "Lunderberg", "Affiliation": "Howard Taylor Ricketts Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sao-Mai", "Last Name": "Nguyen-Mau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "G Stefan", "Last Name": "Richter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ya-Ting", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dominique M", "Last Name": "Missiakas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olaf", "Last Name": "Schneewind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bacteriology", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}]
