[{"PMID": "38854145", "Title": "Temporal Interactions between Neural Proxies forMemory Recall, Negative Affect, and EmotionRegulation in Major Depression.", "Abstract": "Dysfunction in emotion regulation (ER) and autobiographical memory are components of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about how they mechanistically interact with mood disturbances in real time. Using machine learning-based neural signatures, we can quantify negative affect (NA), ER, and memory continuously to evaluate how these processes dynamically interact in MDD. Unmedicated individuals with MDD (N=45) and healthy volunteers (HV; N=38) completed a negative autobiographical memory functional magnetic resonance imaging task wherein they recalled, distanced from (an ER strategy), and immersed into memories. We used a negative affect signature (PINES) and an emotion regulation signature (ERS) to quantify moment-to-moment NA and ER. We then examined whether memory engagement, indexed by hippocampal activity, predicted subsequent change in PINES and ERS over time. During memory recall and immersion, greater hippocampal activity predicted increased PINES across groups. During distancing, greater hippocampal activity in HVs predicted increased ERS but not PINES. In MDD, greater hippocampal activity predicted increased PINES but not ERS. Findings suggest abnormalities in the real-time relationship between memory, NA, and ER in MDD. During distancing, as predicted, HVs showed an attenuation of the linkage between memory engagement and NA, and they had subsequent increases in ER following memory reactivation. In contrast, MDD was characterized by continued linkage between memory engagement and NA, without subsequent increases in ER. Deficits in engagement of ER and ineffective modulation of NA following negative memory recall may contribute to the mood disturbances in MDD and are potential targets for clinical intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christina", "Last Name": "Michel", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mike", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "J John", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Herzog", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Ochsner", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Lila", "Last Name": "Davachi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Noam", "Last Name": "Schneck", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2024May30"}, {"PMID": "38641208", "Title": "Training in cognitive reappraisal normalizes whole-brain indices of emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Borderline personality disorder is the prototypical disorder of emotion dysregulation.

This study examined the association between the endogenous sex hormone estradiol and emotional attentional biases in adolescent females with either current or remitted depression. Three groups of participants (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) completed the Emotional Interrupt Task: 1) 20 adolescent females (15.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.83\u00a0years) currently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), 2) 16 adolescent females (16.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.31\u00a0years) who had experienced at least one episode of MDD in their lifetime but currently met criteria for MDD in remission, and 3) 30 adolescent female (15.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.83\u00a0years) healthy controls. Attentional interference (AI) scores were calculated as differences in target response reaction time between trials with emotional facial expressions versus neutral facial expressions.

Robust multiple regression with product terms evaluated estradiol's main effect on AI scores, as well as hypothesized estradiol \u00d7 diagnostic group interactions. Although neither mean estradiol levels nor mean AI scores in the current-MDD and remitted-MDD groups differed from controls, the relationship between estradiol and overall AI score differed between control adolescents and the remitted-MDD group. Specifically, the remitted-MDD adolescents performed worse (i.e., showed greater attentional interference) when they had higher estradiol; no significant relationship existed in the current-MDD group. Because this finding was driven by angry and not happy stimuli, it appears higher estradiol levels were associated with greater susceptibility to the attention-capturing effects of negatively-valenced emotional content in girls at risk for MDD from prior history.", "Keywords": ["Adolescent depression", "Attentional bias", "Emotional interference task", "Estradiol"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adolescent", "Female", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Estradiol", "Depression", "Emotions", "Affect", "Facial Expression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abigail J", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center, Hartford HealthCare, Hartford, CT 06106, United States of America.

To answer this question, one must first think of potential emotion words before choosing the best fit. However, we have little insight into how the ability to rapidly bring to mind emotion words-emotion fluency-relates to emotion functioning or general verbal abilities. In this study, we measured emotion fluency by counting how many emotion words participants could generate in 60 s. Participants (N = 151 in 2011-2012) also completed a behavioral measure of verbal fluency (i.e., how many words starting with \"P\" or \"J\" participants could produce in 60 s), a cognitive reappraisal emotion regulation task, and emotion functioning questionnaires. In preregistered analyses, we found that participants produced more negative emotion words than positive words and more positive words than neutral words in the emotion fluency task. As hypothesized, emotion fluency was positively related to verbal fluency, but contrary to hypotheses, emotion fluency was not related to self-reported or task-based emotion functioning (e.g., alexithymia, depression, and emotion regulation ability). As such, in community samples, emotion fluency may reflect general cognitive abilities rather than processes crucial to emotional well-being. While emotion fluency as measured here does not track indices of well-being, future research is needed to investigate potential contexts in which verbal fluency for emotion words may be key to emotion regulation.

Early stages of mindfulness practice may require greater neural effort for later efficiency. Early effort may self-regulate behavior and focalize the present, but this understanding lacks a computational explanation. Here we used network control theory as a model of how external control inputs-operationalizing effort-distribute changes in neural activity evoked during mindful attention across the white matter network. We hypothesized that individuals with greater network controllability, thereby efficiently distributing control inputs, effectively self-regulate behavior. We further hypothesized that brain regions that utilize greater control input exhibit shorter intrinsic timescales of neural activity. Shorter timescales characterize quickly discontinuing past processing to focalize the present. We tested these hypotheses in a randomized controlled study that primed participants to either mindfully respond or naturally react to alcohol cues during fMRI and administered text reminders and measurements of alcohol consumption during 4 wk postscan. We found that participants with greater network controllability moderated alcohol consumption. Mindful regulation of alcohol cues, compared to one's own natural reactions, reduced craving, but craving did not differ from the baseline group. Mindful regulation of alcohol cues, compared to the natural reactions of the baseline group, involved more-effortful control of neural dynamics across cognitive control and attention subnetworks. This effort persisted in the natural reactions of the mindful group compared to the baseline group. More-effortful neural states had shorter timescales than less effortful states, offering an explanation for how mindful attention promotes being present.", "Keywords": ["brain network dynamics", "mindfulness", "network control theory", "neural intrinsic timescale"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mindfulness", "Attention", "Brain", "Craving", "Self-Control"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dale", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Yoona", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Cosme", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Mia", "Last Name": "Jovanova", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Xiaosong", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Arun", "Last Name": "Mahadevan", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Jeesung", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Ovidia", "Last Name": "Stanoi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY 19104."}, {"First Name": "Julia K", "Last Name": "Brynildsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Eli J", "Last Name": "Cornblath", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Linden", "Last Name": "Parkes", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "Mucha", "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755."}, {"First Name": "Kevin N", "Last Name": "Ochsner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY 19104."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Lydon-Staley", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Emily B", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Dani S", "Last Name": "Bassett", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jan10"}, {"PMID": "36567086", "Title": "The Temporal Dynamics of Emotion Regulation in Subjects With Major Depression and Healthy Control Subjects.", "Abstract": "Emotion regulation (ER) processes help support well-being, but ineffective ER is implicated in several psychiatric disorders.

Participants who named their emotions before reappraising reported feeling worse than those who regulated without naming. Study 2 (N = 60) replicated these findings in a within-participants design, demonstrated that emotion naming also impeded regulation via mindful acceptance, and showed that observed effects were unrelated to a measure of social desirability, thereby mitigating the concern of experimenter demand.

Twenty-seven schizophrenia participants and 21 healthy control subjects watched a clip of the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly while high resolution multiband functional MRI images were collected. We used inter-subject correlation to measure the evoked activity, which we then compared to social cognition as measured by The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). We also compared between groups the TPJ-pSTS blood oxygen level-dependent activity (i) relationship with the motion content in the film; (ii) synchronization with other cortical areas involved in the viewing of the movie; and (iii) relationship with the frequency of saccades made during the movie. Activation deficits were greatest in middle TPJ (TPJm) and correlated significantly with impaired TASIT performance across groups. Follow-up analyses of the TPJ-pSTS revealed decreased synchronization with other cortical areas, decreased correlation with the motion content of the movie, and decreased correlation with the saccades made during the movie. The functional impairment of the TPJm, a hub area in the middle of the TPJ-pSTS, predicts deficits in social inference in schizophrenia participants by disrupting the integration of visual motion processing into the TPJ.

We integrated research on social support, the self-regulation of emotion, and appraisal theories to hypothesize that different kinds of support and emotion regulation strategies should be differentially helpful for others, depending on the kind of emotion they are experiencing. Specifically, we predicted that helping others to actively modify their situation, as opposed to their appraisals and emotional responses, will be more effective for those experiencing anxiety as anxiety is a response to appraising threat in one's environment. However, helping others to modify their appraisals and emotions should be more effective for those experiencing sadness as sadness is a response to an irrevocable loss. To test this, we created a novel paradigm in which regulation targets were recruited online to write about personal events causing anxiety or sadness and regulation providers were recruited to provide written help to the targets. Study 1 supported the hypothesis using strategies drawn from the social support literature (advice vs. emotional support). Study 2 used strategies drawn from the literature on the self-regulation of emotion (situation modification vs. reappraisal) to demonstrate that as predicted, different strategies are believed to be differentially helpful depending on the target's emotion and when adjusting for individual differences in social and affective functioning, targets judge social emotion regulation strategies to be differentially helpful when implemented by providers.

During negative picture viewing, MDD subjects demonstrated significant hippocampal inhibition of amygdala, basal-ganglia, thalamus, orbital frontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (IFG, dmPFC). MDD-related connectivity was not associated with raphe 5-HT1A binding. However, greater hippocampal inhibition of amygdala, thalamus, IFG and dmPFC correlated with hippocampal 5-HT1A binding.

Here, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining structural brain and behavioral changes associated with regulation of craving across development. In a longitudinal design, individuals ages 6-26 completed two structural scans as well as a behavioral task where they used a cognitive regulatory strategy to decrease the appetitive value of foods. Behaviorally, we found that the ability to regulate craving improved with age. Neurally, improvements in regulatory ability were associated with cortical thinning in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. We also found that models with cortical thickness measurements and age chosen by a lasso-based variable selection method could predict an individual's regulation behavior better than age and other behavioral factors alone.

How does affective reciprocity arise in human groups? The prediction of interpersonal sentiment has been a long-standing pursuit in the social sciences. We combined fMRI and longitudinal social network data to test whether newly acquainted group members' reward-related neural responses to images of one another's faces predict their future interpersonal sentiment, even many months later. Specifically, we analyze associations between relationship-specific valuation activity and relationship-specific future liking. We found that one's own future (T2) liking of a particular group member is predicted jointly by actor's initial (T1) neural valuation of partner and by that partner's initial (T1) neural valuation of actor. These actor and partner effects exhibited equivalent predictive strength and were robust when statistically controlling for each other, both individuals' initial liking, and other potential drivers of liking. Behavioral findings indicated that liking was initially unreciprocated at T1 yet became strongly reciprocated by T2. The emergence of affective reciprocity was partly explained by the reciprocal pathways linking dyad members' T1 neural data both to their own and to each other's T2 liking outcomes. These findings elucidate interpersonal brain mechanisms that define how we ultimately end up liking particular interaction partners, how group members' initially idiosyncratic sentiments become reciprocated, and more broadly, how dyads evolve.

However, the phenomenon of vicarious anxiety-the experience of anxiety in response to observing others expressing anxiety-and the interpersonal mechanisms underlying it have not been fully investigated in prior research. In 4 studies, we investigate the role of empathy in experiencing vicarious anxiety, using film clips depicting target victims facing threats. In Studies 1 and 2, trait emotional empathy was associated with greater self-reported anxiety when observing target victims, and with perceiving greater anxiety to be experienced by the targets. Study 3 extended these findings by demonstrating that trait empathic concern-the tendency to feel concern and compassion for others-was associated with experiencing vicarious anxiety, whereas trait personal distress-the tendency to experience distress in stressful situations-was not. Study 4 manipulated state empathy to establish a causal relationship between empathy and experience of vicarious anxiety. Participants who took an empathic perspective when observing target victims, as compared to those who took an objective perspective using reappraisal-based strategies, reported experiencing greater anxiety, risk-aversion, and sleep disruption the following night. These results highlight the impact of one's social environment on experiencing anxiety, particularly for those who are highly empathic.

Perceivers were scanned using fMRI while repeatedly encountering three social targets who produced conflicting visual and verbal emotional cues. Perceivers guessed how targets felt and received feedback about whether they had guessed correctly.

We found that people were strikingly accurate when predicting how they would feel about the September 11 attacks over 1-, 2-, and 7-year prediction intervals. Although people slightly under- or overestimated their future feelings at times, they nonetheless showed high accuracy in forecasting (a) the overall intensity of their future negative emotion, and (b) the relative degree of different types of negative emotion (i.e., sadness, fear, or anger). Using a path model, we found that the relationship between forecasted and actual future emotion was partially mediated by current emotion and remembered emotion. These results extend theories of affective forecasting by showing that emotional responses to an event of ongoing national significance can be predicted with high accuracy, and by identifying current and remembered feelings as independent sources of this accuracy.

Each group member (perceiver) viewed faces of every other group member (target) while whole-brain functional MRI data were collected. Independent functional localizer tasks were used to identify brain systems supporting affective valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala) and social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporoparietal junction), respectively. During the face-viewing task, activity in both types of neural systems tracked targets' sociometric popularity, even when controlling for potential confounds. The target popularity-social cognition system relationship was mediated by valuation system activity, suggesting that observing popular individuals elicits value signals that facilitate understanding their mental states.

Craving is known to predict methamphetamine use and relapse following abstinence. Some have suggested that cravings are automatic, generalized, and uncontrollable, but experimental work addressing these claims is lacking. In 2 exploratory studies, we tested the boundary conditions of methamphetamine craving by asking: (a) is craving specific to users' preferred route of administration?, and (b) can craving be regulated by cognitive strategies? Two groups of methamphetamine users were recruited. In Study 1, participants were grouped by their preferred route of administration (intranasal vs. smoking), and rated their craving in response to photographs and movies depicting methamphetamine use (via the intranasal vs. smoking route). In Study 2, methamphetamine smokers implemented cognitive regulation strategies while viewing photographs depicting methamphetamine smoking. Strategies involved either focusing on the positive aspects of smoking methamphetamine or the negative consequences of doing so-the latter strategy based on treatment protocols for addiction. In Study 1, we found a significant interaction between group and route of administration, such that participants who preferred to smoke methamphetamine reported significantly stronger craving for smoking stimuli, whereas those who preferred the intranasal route reported stronger craving for intranasal stimuli. In Study 2, participants reported significantly lower craving when focusing on the negative consequences associated with methamphetamine use.

The study, therefore, examines retention of flashbulb memories and event memories at a substantially longer retention interval than any previous study using a test-retest methodology, allowing for the study of such memories over the long term. There was rapid forgetting of both flashbulb and event memories within the first year, but the forgetting curves leveled off after that, not significantly changing even after a 10-year delay. Despite the initial rapid forgetting, confidence remained high throughout the 10-year period. Five putative factors affecting flashbulb memory consistency and event memory accuracy were examined: (a) attention to media, (b) the amount of discussion, (c) residency, (d) personal loss and/or inconvenience, and (e) emotional intensity. After 10 years, none of these factors predicted flashbulb memory consistency; media attention and ensuing conversation predicted event memory accuracy. Inconsistent flashbulb memories were more likely to be repeated rather than corrected over the 10-year period; inaccurate event memories, however, were more likely to be corrected.

While prior work has made great strides in characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes, the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the causal relationship between attentional deployment and emotion regulation success. We examined 2 commonly used emotion regulation strategies--cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-because both depend on attention but have divergent behavioral, experiential, and physiological outcomes. Participants were either instructed to regulate emotions during free-viewing (unrestricted image viewing) or gaze-controlled (restricted image viewing) conditions and to self-report negative emotional experience. For both emotion regulation strategies, emotion regulation success was not altered by changes in participant control over the (a) direction of attention (free-viewing vs. gaze-controlled) during image viewing and (b) valence (negative vs. neutral) of visual stimuli viewed when gaze was controlled. Taken together, these findings provide convergent evidence that attentional deployment does not alter subjective negative emotional experience during either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression, suggesting that strategy-specific processes, such as cognitive appraisal and response modulation, respectively, may have a greater impact on emotional regulation success than processes common to both strategies, such as attention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Behavior Control", "Cognition", "Emotions", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Reference Values", "Repression, Psychology", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Genna M", "Last Name": "Bebko", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Franconeri", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northwestern University."}, {"First Name": "Kevin N", "Last Name": "Ochsner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Joan Y", "Last Name": "Chiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northwestern University."}], "Journal": "Emotion (Washington, D.C.)", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}, {"PMID": "24493847", "Title": "The neural bases of uninstructed negative emotion modulation.", "Abstract": "Although numerous neuroimaging studies have examined what happens when individuals are instructed to regulate their emotions, we rarely receive such instruction in everyday life.

Two analyses were conducted to identify how variability in negative affect related to neural responses when responding naturally. First, in a within-participant analysis, lower levels of self-reported negative affect on a given trial were associated with recruitment of dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)-brain regions also active during instructed reappraisal-whereas higher levels of negative affect were associated with recruitment of the amygdala-a region that responded more strongly overall to negative than neutral stimuli.

To address this issue, we focused on one strategy, reappraisal, which involves cognitively reframing affective events in ways that modulate one's emotional response to them. With a commonly used reappraisal task, we assessed the behavioral correlates of four laboratory sessions of guided practice in down-regulating responses to aversive photos. Two groups received practice in one of two types of reappraisal tactics: psychological distancing and reinterpretation. A third no-regulation control group viewed images in each session without instructions to regulate. Three key findings were observed. First, both distancing and reinterpretation training resulted in reductions over time in self-reported negative affect. Second, distancing participants also showed a reduction over time in negative affect on baseline trials in which they responded naturally. Only distancing group participants showed such a reduction over and above the reduction observed in the no-regulation control group, indicating that it was not attributable to habituation.

Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions.

However, the gulf between animal and human studies remains a formidable obstacle: human studies typically focus on the cortex and a few subcortical regions such as the amygdala, whereas deeper structures such as the brainstem periaqueductal gray (PAG) play a key role in animal models. Here, we directly assessed the role of PAG in human affect by interleaving in a single fMRI session two conditions known to elicit strong emotional responses--physical pain and negative image viewing. Negative affect and PAG activity increased in both conditions. We next examined eight independent data sets, half featuring pain stimulation and half negative image viewing. In sum, these data sets comprised 198 additional participants. We found increased activity in PAG in all eight studies. Taken together, these findings suggest PAG is a key component of human affective responses.", "Keywords": ["affect", "emotion", "fMRI", "pain", "periaqueductal gray"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Oxygen", "Pain", "Periaqueductal Gray", "Physical Stimulation", "Reproducibility of Results", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason T", "Last Name": "Buhle", "Affiliation": "Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Unit, Department of Psychology, Columbia University, 406 Schermerhorn Hall, 1190 Amsterdam Avenue, NY 10027, USA. jtb2102@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Hedy", "Last Name": "Kober", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin N", "Last Name": "Ochsner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Mende-Siedlecki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jochen", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brent L", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ethan", "Last Name": "Kross", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lauren Y", "Last Name": "Atlas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kateri", "Last Name": "McRae", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tor D", "Last Name": "Wager", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Social cognitive and affective neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}]
