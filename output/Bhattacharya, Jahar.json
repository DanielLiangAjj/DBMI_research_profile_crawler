Our findings show that IAV infection blocked defensive alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion and induced airspace liquid absorption, thereby reversing normal alveolar liquid dynamics and inhibiting alveolar clearance of inhaled SA. Loss of AWL secretion resulted from inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel in the alveolar epithelium, and airspace liquid absorption was caused by stimulation of the alveolar epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Loss of AWL secretion promoted alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA, but rescue of AWL secretion protected against alveolar SA stabilization and fatal SA-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice.

Multiple organ failure predisposes to the mortality, but mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays a role in the barrier failure. Subsequent lung-liver cross talk mediated by neutrophil activation causes liver congestion. We intranasally instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, we viewed the lung endothelium by real-time confocal imaging of the isolated, blood-perfused mouse lung. LPS caused alveolar-capillary transfer of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial depolarization in lung venular capillaries. The mitochondrial depolarization was inhibited by transfection of alveolar Catalase and vascular knockdown of UCP2. LPS instillation caused lung injury as indicated by increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein content and extravascular lung water. LPS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa instillation also caused liver congestion, quantified by liver hemoglobin and plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases. Genetic inhibition of vascular UCP2 prevented both lung injury and liver congestion. Antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion blocked the liver responses, but not lung injury. Knockdown of lung vascular UCP2 mitigated P. aeruginosa-induced mortality. Together, these data suggest a mechanism in which bacterial pneumonia induces oxidative signaling to lung venular capillaries, known sites of inflammatory signaling in the lung microvasculature, depolarizing venular mitochondria. Successive activation of neutrophils induces liver congestion. We conclude that oxidant-induced UCP2 expression in lung venular capillaries causes a mechanistic sequence leading to liver congestion and mortality. Lung vascular UCP2 may present a therapeutic target in ARDS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We report that mitochondrial injury in lung venular capillaries underlies barrier failure in pneumonia, and venular capillary uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) causes neutrophil-mediated liver congestion.

Some patients with severe Covid-19 experience a cytokine storm and display evidence of inflammasome activation leading to increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18; however, other reports have suggested reduced inflammatory responses to Sars-Cov-2. In this study we have examined the effects of the Sars-Cov-2 envelope (E) protein, a virulence factor in coronaviruses, on inflammasome activation and pulmonary inflammation. In cultured macrophages the E protein suppressed inflammasome priming and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similarly, in mice transfected with E protein and treated with poly(I:C) to simulate the effects of viral RNA, the E protein, in an NLRP3-dependent fashion, reduced expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2, levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, and macrophage infiltration in the lung. To simulate the effects of more advanced infection, macrophages were treated with both LPS and poly(I:C). In this setting the E protein increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both murine and human macrophages. Thus, the Sars-Cov-2 E protein may initially suppress the host NLRP3 inflammasome response to viral RNA while potentially increasing NLRP3 inflammasome responses in the later stages of infection.

The efficacy of PS- and interface-assisted drug vehiculization was determined both in vitro and in vivo using a native purified porcine PS combined with the hydrophobic anti-inflammatory drug Tacrolimus (TAC), a calcineurin inhibitor. In vitro assays were conducted in a novel double surface balance setup designed to emulate compression-expansion dynamics applied to interfacially connected drug donor and recipient compartments. In this setup, PS transported TAC efficiently over air-liquid interfaces, with compression/expansion breathing-like dynamics enhancing rapid interface-assisted diffusion and drug release. The efficacy of PS-assisted TAC vehiculization was also evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In anesthetized mice, TAC combined with PS was intra-nasally (i.n) instilled prior administering i.n. LPS. PS/TAC pre-treatment caused greater TAC internalization into a higher number of lung cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) than TAC pre-treatment alone. Additionally, the PS/TAC combination but not TAC or PS alone attenuated the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory effects reducing cells and proteins in BAL fluid. These findings indicated that PS-mediated increase in TAC uptake blunted the pro-injurious effects of LPS, suggesting a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect of PS/drug formulations.

By alveolar micropuncture, we microinfused concentrated HCl in the alveolar lumen. As expected, acid contact with the epithelium caused rapid, but transient, apical injury. However, there was no concomitant membrane injury to the endothelium. Nevertheless, H2O2-mediated epithelial-endothelial paracrine signaling induced endothelial barrier failure, as detected by microvascular dextran leakage and lung water quantification. Remarkably, endothelial mitochondria regulated the barrier failure by activating uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), thereby inducing transient mitochondrial depolarization that led to cofilin-induced actin depolymerization. Knockdown, or endothelium-targeted deletion of UCP2 expression, blocked these responses, including pulmonary edema. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to mechanistically implicate endothelial mitochondria in acid-induced barrier deterioration and pulmonary edema.

Understanding its effects at the molecular level may provide insight into mechanisms of injury and protection. The aim of this study was to establish the effects of hypercapnic acidosis on mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and determine the relevant signalling pathways. p44/42 MAPK activation in a murine model of ventilator\u2010induced lung injury (VILI) correlated with injury and was reduced in hypercapnia. When cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells were subjected to cyclic stretch, activation of p44/42 MAPK was dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity and on shedding of EGFR ligands; exposure to 12% CO2 without additional buffering blocked ligand shedding, as well as EGFR and p44/42 MAPK activation. The EGFR ligands are known substrates of the matrix metalloprotease ADAM17, suggesting stretch activates and hypercapnic acidosis blocks stretch\u2010mediated activation of ADAM17. This was corroborated in the isolated perfused mouse lung, where elevated CO2 also inhibited stretch\u2010activated shedding of the ADAM17 substrate TNFR1 from airway epithelial cells. Finally, in vivo confirmation was obtained in a two\u2010hit murine model of VILI where pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17 reduced both injury and p44/42 MAPK activation.

During lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, the AMs remained sessile and attached to the alveoli, and they established intercommunication through synchronized Ca(2+) waves, using the epithelium as the conducting pathway. The intercommunication was immunosuppressive, involving Ca(2+)-dependent activation of Akt, because AM-specific knockout of Cx43 enhanced alveolar neutrophil recruitment and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage.

However, the dynamics of LBs during the secretion process are not known in intact alveoli. Here, we addressed this question through real-time confocal microscopy of single AT2 cells in live alveoli of mouse lungs. Using a combination of phospholipid and aqueous fluorophores that localize to LBs, we induced surfactant secretion by transiently hyperinflating the lung, and we quantified the secretion in terms of loss of bulk LB fluorescence. In addition, we quantified inter-LB phospholipid flow through determinations of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Furthermore, we determined the role of F-actin in surfactant secretion through expression of the fluorescent F-actin probe Lifeact. Our findings indicate that, in AT2 cells in situ, LBs are held in an F-actin scaffold. Although F-actin transiently decreases during surfactant secretion, the LBs remain stationary, forming a chain of vesicles connected by intervesicular channels that convey surfactant to the secretion site on the plasma membrane.
