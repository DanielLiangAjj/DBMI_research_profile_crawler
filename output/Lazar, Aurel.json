We demonstrate that two cascaded divisive normalization processors (DNPs), carrying out intensity/contrast gain control and elementary motion detection, respectively, can model the robust motion detection realized by the early visual system of the fruit fly. We first introduce a model of elementary motion detection and rewrite its underlying phase-based motion detection algorithm as a feedforward divisive normalization processor. We then cascade the DNP modeling the photoreceptor/amacrine cell layer with the motion detection DNP. We extensively evaluate the DNP for motion detection in dynamic environments where light intensity varies by orders of magnitude. The results are compared to other bio-inspired motion detectors as well as state-of-the-art optic flow algorithms under natural conditions. Our results demonstrate the potential of DNPs as canonical building blocks modeling the analog processing of early visual systems.

The resulting combinatorial neural code is a confounding representation of odorant semantic information (identity) and syntactic information (concentration). To distill the functional logic of odor information processing in the Antennal Lobe (AL) a number of challenges need to be addressed including 1) how is the odorant semantic information decoupled from the syntactic information at the level of the AL, 2) how are these two information streams processed by the diverse AL Local Neurons (LNs) and 3) what is the end-to-end functional logic of the AL? By analyzing single-channel physiology recordings at the output of the AL, we found that the Projection Neuron responses can be decomposed into a concentration-invariant component, and two transient components boosting the positive/negative concentration contrast that indicate onset/offset timing information of the odorant object. We hypothesized that the concentration-invariant component, in the multi-channel context, is the recovered odorant identity vector presented between onset/offset timing events. We developed a model of LN pathways in the Antennal Lobe termed the differential Divisive Normalization Processors (DNPs), which robustly extract the semantics (the identity of the odorant object) and the ON/OFF semantic timing events indicating the presence/absence of an odorant object. For real-time processing with spiking PN models, we showed that the phase-space of the biological spike generator of the PN offers an intuit perspective for the representation of recovered odorant semantics and examined the dynamics induced by the odorant semantic timing events.

Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized, and the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined. Identity and concentration, two key characteristics of the space of odorants, are encoded by the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model odorant identity and concentration using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the mechanics of the molecular ligand binding/dissociation of the OTP. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron. The resulting spatio-temporal encoding model of the Drosophila antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the spatio-temporal level of complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent spatio-temporal code at the output of the antenna circuits determines the level of complexity of olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiological recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs.

Our approach builds on the observation that during any experiment, an entire neural circuit, including its receptive fields and biophysical spike generators, is projected onto the space of stimuli used to identify the circuit. Employing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of trigonometric polynomials to describe input stimuli, we quantitatively describe the relationship between underlying circuit parameters and their projections. We also derive experimental conditions under which these projections converge to the true parameters. In doing so, we achieve the mathematical tractability needed to characterize the biophysical spike generator and identify the multitude of receptive fields. The algorithms obviate the need to repeat experiments in order to compute the neurons' rate of response, rendering our methodology of interest to both experimental and theoretical neuroscientists.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aurel A", "Last Name": "Lazar", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, U.S.A. aurel@ee.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Yevgeniy B", "Last Name": "Slutskiy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23545540", "Title": "The power of connectivity: identity preserving transformations on visual streams in the spike domain.", "Abstract": "We investigate neural architectures for identity preserving transformations (IPTs) on visual stimuli in the spike domain. The stimuli are encoded with a population of spiking neurons; the resulting spikes are processed and finally decoded. A number of IPTs are demonstrated including faithful stimulus recovery, as well as simple transformations on the original visual stimulus such as translations, rotations and zoomings. We show that if the set of receptive fields satisfies certain symmetry properties, then IPTs can easily be realized and additionally, the same basic stimulus decoding algorithm can be employed to recover the transformed input stimulus. Using group theoretic methods we advance two different neural encoding architectures and discuss the realization of exact and approximate IPTs. These are realized in the spike domain processing block by a \"switching matrix\" that regulates the input/output connectivity between the stimulus encoding and decoding blocks. For example, for a particular connectivity setting of the switching matrix, the original stimulus is faithfully recovered. For other settings, translations, rotations and dilations (or combinations of these operations) of the original video stream are obtained. We evaluate our theoretical derivations through extensive simulations on natural video scenes, and discuss implications of our results on the problem of invariant object recognition in the spike domain.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aurel A", "Last Name": "Lazar", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. aurel@ee.columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Eftychios A", "Last Name": "Pnevmatikakis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yiyin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}]
