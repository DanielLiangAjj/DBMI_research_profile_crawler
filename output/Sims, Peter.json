[{"PMID": "38895402", "Title": "Resistance to Spindle Inhibitors in Glioblastoma Depends on STAT3 and Therapy Induced Senescence.", "Abstract": "While mitotic spindle inhibitors specifically kill proliferating tumor cells without the toxicities of microtubule poisons, resistance has limited their clinical utility. Treating glioblastomas with the spindle inhibitors ispinesib, alisertib, or volasertib creates a subpopulation of therapy induced senescent cells that resist these drugs by relying upon the anti-apoptotic and metabolic effects of activated STAT3. Furthermore, these senescent cells expand the repertoire of cells resistant to these drugs by secreting an array of factors, including TGF\u03b2, which induce proliferating cells to exit mitosis and become quiescent-a state that also resists spindle inhibitors. Targeting STAT3 restores sensitivity to each of these drugs by depleting the senescent subpopulation and inducing quiescent cells to enter the mitotic cycle. These results support a therapeutic strategy of targeting STAT3-dependent therapy-induced senescence to enhance the efficacy of spindle inhibitors for the treatment of glioblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natanael", "Last Name": "Zarco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Athanassios", "Last Name": "Dovas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virginea", "Last Name": "de Araujo Farias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Naveen Kh", "Last Name": "Nagaiah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashley", "Last Name": "Haddock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dolores", "Last Name": "Hambardzumyan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian T", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven S", "Last Name": "Rosenfeld", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rajappa S", "Last Name": "Kenchappa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun09"}, {"PMID": "38848677", "Title": "Time-resolved fate mapping identifies the intestinal upper crypt zone as an origin of Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells.", "Abstract": "In the prevailing model, Lgr5+ cells are the only intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that sustain homeostatic epithelial regeneration by upward migration of progeny through elusive upper crypt transit-amplifying (TA) intermediates.

characterized by poor prognosis and composed of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells that intermingle with non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, including neurons. Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander R", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation":

system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages.

Dimensionality reduction is required to facilitate integration, interpretation, and statistical analysis. However, these datasets often include subtly different cellular subpopulations or state transitions, which are poorly described by clustering. We previously reported a Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm called single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF) that identifies gene co-expression patterns directly from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count matrices while accounting for transcript drop-out and noise. Here, we describe consensus scHPF, which analyzes scHPF models from multiple random initializations to identify the most robust gene signatures and automatically determine the number of factors for a given dataset. Consensus scHPF facilitates integration of complex datasets with highly multi-modal posterior distributions, resulting in factors that can be uniformly analyzed across individuals and conditions. To demonstrate the utility of consensus scHPF, we performed a meta-analysis of a large-scale scRNA-seq dataset from drug-treated, human glioma slice cultures generated from surgical specimens across three major cell types, 19 patients, 10 drug treatment conditions, and 52 samples.

Using human CRC cells (DLD-1, Caco-2, and LoVo) with either knockdown or overexpression of LIN28B, we identified claudin 1 (CLDN1) tight junction protein as a direct downstream target and effector of LIN28B. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that LIN28B directly binds to and posttranscriptionally regulates CLDN1 mRNA. Furthermore, using in vitro assays and a potentially novel murine model of metastatic CRC, we show that LIN28B-mediated CLDN1 expression enhances collective invasion, cell migration, and metastatic liver tumor formation. Bulk RNA sequencing of the metastatic liver tumors identified NOTCH3 as a downstream effector of the LIN28B/CLDN1 axis. Additionally, genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of NOTCH3 signaling revealed that NOTCH3 was necessary for invasion and metastatic liver tumor formation. In summary, our results suggest that LIN28B promotes invasion and liver metastasis of CRC by posttranscriptionally regulating CLDN1 and activating NOTCH3 signaling.

With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it has been unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-\u03b3 into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and their response kinetics were similar in neurons and glia, but with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, which were the only cells to undergo cellular proliferation and express MHC classII (MHC-II) and associated genes. To determine if neurons respond directly via cell-autonomous IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) signaling, we produced mutant mice with a deletion of the IFN-\u03b3-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, which resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic neuronal responses to IFN-\u03b3. Our results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces neuronal IFNGR signaling and upregulation of MHC-I and related genes in vivo, although the expression level is low compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Interferon-gamma", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Central Nervous System", "Astrocytes", "Mesencephalon"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin D", "Last Name": "Hobson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Medical Scientist Training Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adrien T", "Last Name": "Stanley", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark B", "Last Name": "De Los Santos", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Culbertson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Medical Scientist Training Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eugene V", "Last Name": "Mosharov", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States; Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, MD, United States.

During neural development, lineage trajectories rely on specialized metabolic pathways. However, the link between tumor cell state and metabolic programs is poorly understood in glioma. Here we uncover a glioma cell state-specific metabolic liability that can be leveraged therapeutically. To model cell state diversity, we generated genetically engineered murine gliomas, induced by deletion of p53 alone (p53) or with constitutively active Notch signaling (N1IC), a pathway critical in controlling cellular fate. N1IC tumors harbored quiescent astrocyte-like transformed cell states while p53 tumors were predominantly comprised of proliferating progenitor-like cell states. N1IC cells exhibit distinct metabolic alterations, with mitochondrial uncoupling and increased ROS production rendering them more sensitive to inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis. Importantly, treating patient-derived organotypic slices with a GPX4 inhibitor induced selective depletion of quiescent astrocyte-like glioma cell populations with similar metabolic profiles.", "Keywords": ["Astrocyte", "Cell-state", "Ferroptosis", "Glioblastoma", "Metabolism", "Quiescent"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matei A", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Athanassios", "Last Name": "Dovas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Argenziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenting", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of System Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henar Cuervo", "Last Name": "Grajal", "Affiliation": "Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Dominique M O", "Last Name": "Higgins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin P", "Last Name": "Sperring", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brianna", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ling F", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia L", "Last Name": "Furnari", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavan S", "Last Name": "Upadhyayula", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fereshteh", "Last Name": "Zandkarimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang T T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter B", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Hai", "Affiliation": "Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Karan", "Affiliation": "Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aida", "Last Name": "Razavilar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "University of Illinois Cancer Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of System Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Feb23"}, {"PMID": "36798358", "Title": "Scalable co-sequencing of RNA and DNA from individual nuclei.", "Abstract": "The ideal technology for directly investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype would analyze both RNA and DNA genome-wide and with single-cell resolution.

However, development of resistance has limited their clinical utility. While resistance to Kif11 inhibitors in other cell types is due to mechanisms that prevent these drugs from disrupting mitosis, we find that in glioblastoma (GBM), resistance to the Kif11 inhibitor ispinesib works instead through suppression of apoptosis driven by activation of STAT3. This form of resistance requires dual phosphorylation of STAT3 residues Y705 and S727, mediated by SRC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), respectively. Simultaneously inhibiting SRC and EGFR reverses this resistance, and combined targeting of these two kinases in\u00a0vivo with clinically available inhibitors is synergistic and significantly prolongs survival in ispinesib-treated GBM-bearing mice.

We found marked loss of type 2 alveolar epithelial (T2AE) cells and increased perialveolar lymphocyte cytotoxicity in all fatal COVID-19 cases, even at early stages before typical patterns of acute lung injury are histologically apparent.

The kinase DCLK1 and intestinal Dclk1-positive cells have been reported to contribute to intestinal regeneration. Although Dclk1-positive cells are present in adult enteric ganglia, their cellular identity and response to acute injury have not been investigated in detail. Here, we reveal the presence of distinct Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like and Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types in adult myenteric ganglia. These ganglionic cells demonstrate distinct patterns of tracing over time yet show a similar expansion in response to elevated serotonergic signaling. Interestingly, Dclk1-tdTom+ glial-like and neuronal cell types appear resistant to acute irradiation injury-mediated cell death. Moreover, Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells show prominent changes in gene expression profiles induced by injury, in contrast to Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types. Finally, subsets of Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells demonstrate prominent overlap with Nestin and p75NTR and strong responses to elevated serotonergic signaling or acute injury. These findings, together with their role in early development and their neural crest-like gene expression signature, suggest the presence of reserve progenitor cells in the adult Dclk1 glial cell lineage.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The kinase DCLK1 identifies glial-like and neuronal cell types in adult murine enteric ganglia, which resist acute injury-mediated cell death yet differ in their cellular response to injury.

Our data thus add to recently emerging evidence of reserve cellular plasticity in the adult enteric nervous system.", "Keywords": ["Dclk1", "enteric nervous system", "ganglionic homeostasis and regeneration", "reserve ganglionic progenitor cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Enteric Nervous System", "Integrin alpha2", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neuroglia", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Moritz", "Last Name": "Middelhoff", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Tomassoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yosuke", "Last Name": "Ochiai", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bryana", "Last Name": "Belin", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ryota", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ermanno", "Last Name": "Malagola", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Henrik", "Last Name": "Nienh\u00fcser", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Finlayson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yoku", "Last Name": "Hayakawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Leah B", "Last Name": "Zamechek", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bernhard W", "Last Name": "Renz", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "C Benedikt", "Last Name": "Westphalen", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Quante", "Affiliation": "Klinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Gastrointestinale Onkologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kara G", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Pasquale", "Last Name": "Laise", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Boston Children\u00b4s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Gershon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Our analysis identified phenotypically and functionally distinguishable effector T cell types. We employed single-cell gene signatures from these T cell subsets to query the TCGA database to assess their prognostic significance. We found 2 distinct cytotoxic T cell types. GZMK+KLRG1+ cytotoxic T cells were enriched in CRC patients with good outcomes.

migration.", "Abstract": "To control sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial Notch signaling suppresses tip cell formation, migration, and proliferation while promoting barrier formation. Each of these responses may be regulated by distinct Notch-regulated effectors. Notch activity is highly dynamic in sprouting endothelial cells, while constitutive Notch signaling drives homeostatic endothelial polarization, indicating the need for both rapid and constitutive Notch targets. In contrast to previous screens that focus on genes regulated by constitutively active Notch, we characterized the dynamic response to Notch. We examined transcriptional changes from 1.5 to 6\u00a0h after Notch signal activation via ligand-specific or EGTA induction in cultured primary human endothelial cells and neonatal mouse brain. In each combination of endothelial type and Notch manipulation, transcriptomic analysis identified distinct but overlapping sets of rapidly regulated genes and revealed many novel Notch target genes.

Upon injury to the neonatal cerebellum, a normally gliogenic nestin-expressing progenitor (NEP) in the Bergmann glia layer (BgL) undergoes adaptive reprograming to restore granule cell production. However, the cellular states and genes regulating the NEP fate switch are unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and fate mapping, we defined molecular subtypes of NEPs and their lineages under homeostasis and repair. NEPs contain two major subtypes: Hopx+ astrogliogenic and Ascl1+ neurogenic NEPs that are further subdivided based on their location, lineage, and differentiation status. Upon injury, an Ascl1+ transitory cellular state arises from Hopx+ BgL-NEPs. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that induction of Ascl1 is required for adaptive reprogramming by orchestrating a glial-to-neural switch in vivo following injury.

Here, we sought to understand these potentially opposing functions by interrogating functional relationships among CAF subtypes, their mediators, desmoplasia, and tumor growth in a wide range of tumor types metastasizing to the liver, the most common organ site for metastasis. Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented the main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis but not in nondesmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice, uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as a tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF-secreted (myCAF-secreted) hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF-secreted (iCAF-secreted) HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals. In summary, mechanical restriction by type I collagen opposes the overall tumor-promoting effects of CAF, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for their dual functions in cancer.

Human pDCs produced high amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I) when incubated with live CMV-infected fibroblasts but not with free CMV; the response involved integrin-mediated adhesion, transfer of DNA-containing virions to pDCs, and the recognition of DNA through TLR9. Compared with transient polyfunctional responses to CpG or free influenza virus, pDC response to CMV-infected cells was long-lasting, dominated by the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, and lacked diversification into functionally distinct populations. Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control.

While previous postmortem studies have identified a cluster of morphological changes in the ET cerebellum centered in/around the Purkinje cell (PC) population, including a loss of PCs in some studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms for these changes are not clear. As genomic studies of ET patients have yet to identify major genetic contributors and animal models that fully recapitulate the human disease do not yet exist, the study of human tissue is currently the most applicable method to gain a mechanistic insight into ET disease pathogenesis. To begin exploration of an underlying molecular source of ET disease pathogenesis, we have performed the first transcriptomic analysis by direct sequencing of RNA from frozen cerebellar cortex tissue in 33 ET patients compared to 21 normal controls. Principal component analysis showed a heterogenous distribution of the expression data in ET patients that only partially overlapped with control patients. Differential expression analysis identified 231 differentially expressed gene transcripts ('top gene hits'), a subset of which has defined expression profiles in the cerebellum across neuronal and glial cell types but a largely unknown relationship to cerebellar function and/or ET pathogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified dysregulated pathways of interest and stratified dysregulation among ET cases. By GSEA and mining curated databases, we compiled major categories of dysregulated processes and clustered string networks of known interacting proteins. Here we demonstrate that these 'top gene hits' contribute to regulation of four main biological processes, which are 1) axon guidance, 2) microtubule motor activity, 3) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport and 4) calcium signaling/synaptic transmission. The results of our transcriptomic analysis suggest there is a range of different processes involved among ET cases, and draws attention to a particular set of genes and regulatory pathways that provide an initial platform to further explore the underlying biology of ET.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Essential tremor", "Gene set enrichment analysis", "Purkinje cell", "RNA-seq", "String networks"], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebellar Cortex", "Databases, Genetic", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gene Expression", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, P&S 15-405, New York, NY, USA; College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 630 W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA.

Using a postmortem series of 156 brains [50 ET, 23 SCA (6 SCA3; 17 SCA 1, 2 or 6), 15 MSA, 29 PD, 14 dystonia, 25 controls], we generated data on 37 quantitative morphologic metrics, which were grouped into 8 broad categories: (1) PC loss, (2) heterotopic PCs, (3) PC dendritic changes, (4) PC axonal changes (torpedoes), (5) PC axonal changes (other than torpedoes), (6) PC axonal changes (torpedo-associated), (7) basket cell axonal hypertrophy, (8) climbing fiber-PC synaptic changes. Our analyses used z scored raw data for each metric across all diagnoses (5772 total data items). Principal component analysis revealed that diagnostic groups were not uniform with respect to cerebellar pathology. Dystonia and PD each differed from controls in only 2/37 metrics, whereas ET differed in 21, SCA3 in 8, MSA in 19, and SCA1/2/6 in 26 metrics. Comparing ET with primary disorders of cerebellar degeneration (i.e., SCAs), we observed a spectrum of changes reflecting differences of degree, being generally mild in ET and SCA3 and more severe in SCA1/2/6. Comparative analyses across morphologic categories demonstrated differences in relative expression, defining distinctive patterns of changes in these groups. Thus, the degree of cerebellar degeneration in ET aligns it with a milder end in the spectrum of cerebellar degenerative disorders, and a somewhat distinctive signature of degenerative changes marks each of these disorders.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Dystonia", "Essential tremor", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Spinocerebellar ataxia"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Axons", "Cerebellar Cortex", "Dystonic Disorders", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinson Disease", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA. elan.louis@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Chlo\u00eb A", "Last Name": "Kerridge", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debotri", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regina T", "Last Name": "Martuscello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel Trujillo", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, 15 York Street, PO Box 208018, New Haven, CT, 06520-8018, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arnulf H", "Last Name": "Koeppen", "Affiliation": "Research, Neurology, and Pathology Services, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Departments of Neurology and Pathology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street, PH Stem 1564, New York, NY, 10032, USA. plf3@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2019Nov"}, {"PMID": "31253076", "Title": "Single cell RNA-Seq reveals pre-cDCs fate determined by transcription factor combinatorial dose.", "Abstract": "Classic dendritic cells (cDCs) play a central role in the immune system by processing and presenting antigens to activate T cells, and consist of two major subsets: CD141+ cDC (cDC1) and CD1c+ cDC (cDC2).

To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC-triggered and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/EDTA/tris (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to PBS, but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments.

One limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such, the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated at the RNA and protein levels.

While less studied, brain tumor (glioma) biology is likewise influenced by non-neoplastic immune system cells (macrophages and microglia) which interact with neoplastic glioma cells to create a unique physiological state (glioma ecosystem) distinct from that found in the normal tissue. To explore this neoplastic ground state, we leveraged several preclinical mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) optic glioma, a low-grade astrocytoma whose formation and maintenance requires productive interactions between non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells, and employed whole tumor RNA-sequencing and mathematical deconvolution strategies to characterize this low-grade glioma ecosystem as an aggregate of cellular and acellular elements. Using this approach, we demonstrate that optic gliomas generated by altering the germline Nf1 gene mutation, the glioma cell of origin, or the presence of co-existing genetic alterations represent molecularly-distinct tumors. However, these optic glioma tumors share a 25-gene core signature, not found in normal optic nerve, that is normalized by microglia inhibition (minocycline), but not conventional (carboplatin) or molecularly-targeted (rapamycin) chemotherapy. Lastly, we identify a genetic signature conferred by Pten reduction and corrected by PI3K inhibition. This signature predicts progression-free survival in patients with either low-grade or high-grade glioma. Collectively, these findings support the concept that gliomas are composite ecological systems whose biology and response to therapy may be best defined by examining the tumor as a whole.", "Keywords": ["AKT", "astrocytoma", "glioma stem cell", "microglia", "neurofibromatosis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erin C", "Last Name": "Bush", "Affiliation": "Departments of Systems Biology and of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Toonen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne C", "Last Name": "Solga", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Departments of Systems Biology and of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Gutmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2017Aug08"}, {"PMID": "28740083", "Title": "PLATE-Seq for genome-wide regulatory network analysis of high-throughput screens.", "Abstract": "Pharmacological and functional genomic screens play an essential role in the discovery and characterization of therapeutic targets and associated pharmacological inhibitors.

Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters.

With a median survival of about a year, new approaches to treating this disease are necessary. To identify signaling molecules regulating GBM progression in a genetically engineered murine model of proneural GBM, we quantified phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling using mass spectrometry. Oncogenic signals, including phosphorylated ERK MAPK, PI3K, and PDGFR, were found to be increased in the murine tumors relative to brain. Phosphorylation of CDK1 pY15, associated with the G2 arrest checkpoint, was identified as the most differentially phosphorylated site, with a 14-fold increase in phosphorylation in the tumors. To assess the role of this checkpoint as a potential therapeutic target, syngeneic primary cell lines derived from these tumors were treated with MK-1775, an inhibitor of Wee1, the kinase responsible for CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation. MK-1775 treatment led to mitotic catastrophe, as defined by increased DNA damage and cell death by apoptosis. To assess the extensibility of targeting Wee1/CDK1 in GBM, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also treated with MK-1775. Although the response was more heterogeneous, on-target Wee1 inhibition led to decreased CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in each line. These results were also validated in vivo, where single-agent MK-1775 demonstrated an antitumor effect on a flank PDX tumor model, increasing mouse survival by 1.74-fold. This study highlights the ability of unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomics to reveal therapeutic targets in tumor models, and the potential for Wee1 inhibition as a treatment approach in preclinical models of GBM.

The Lyn pathway leads to recruitment of Syk and to calcium mobilization whereas the Fyn pathway leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase recruitment. Mapping the connections between both pathways remains an important task to be completed. We previously reported that Phospholipid Scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is phosphorylated on tyrosine after cross-linking Fc\u03b5RI on RBL-2H3 rat mast cells, amplifies mast cell degranulation, and is associated with both Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases. Here, analysis of the pathway leading to PLSCR1 tyrosine phosphorylation reveals that it depends on the FcR\u03b3 chain. Fc\u03b5RI aggregation in Fyn-deficient mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) induced a more robust increase in Fc\u03b5RI-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 compared to wild-type cells, whereas PLSCR1 phosphorylation was abolished in Lyn-deficient BMMC. Lyn association with PLSCR1 was not altered in Fyn-deficient BMMC.

Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature.

Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes.

Proneural gliomas were generated by injecting PDGF-IRES-Cre retrovirus into the subcortical white matter of adult mice that harbor floxed tumor suppressors (Pten and p53) and stop-floxed reporters. Primary cell cultures were generated from the retrovirus induced tumors and maintained in vitro for multiple passages. RNA sequencing-based expression profiling of the resulting cell lines was performed. The tumorigenic potential of the cells was assessed by intracranial injection into adult na\u00efve mice from different strains. Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). BLI for tumor cells and brain slices were obtained and compared to in vivo BLI. Response to whole-brain radiation was assessed in glioma-bearing animals. Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) glioma cells led to formation of GBM-like tumors with 100 % efficiency (n = 48) and tumorigenesis was retained for more than 3 generations. The cell lines specifically resembled proneural GBM based on expression profiling by RNA-Seq. Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) cell number correlated with BLI signal.
