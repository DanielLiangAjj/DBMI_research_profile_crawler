The etchant rapidly quenches the quantum dots through cation exchange (ionic etching), and facilitates renal clearance of metal ions released from the quantum dots. The quantum dots are intravenously delivered into orthotopic breast and pancreas tumors in mice by using the tumor-penetrating iRGD peptide. Subsequent etching quenches excess quantum dots, leaving a highly tumor-specific signal provided by the intact quantum dots remaining in the extravascular tumor cells and fibroblasts. No toxicity is noted. The system also facilitates the detection of peritoneal tumors with high specificity upon intraperitoneal tumor targeting and selective etching of excess untargeted quantum dots. In vivo cation exchange may be a promising strategy to enhance specificity of tumor imaging.The imaging of tumors in vivo using nanoprobes has been challenging due to the lack of sufficient tumor specificity.

The decision over key features - NP size, shape, coating strategies and targeting ligands for clinical translation is often hampered by a lack of quantitative in vivo NP homing assays. Sensitive, internally controlled assays are needed which allow for quantitative comparisons (auditions) among various formulations of targeted NPs. We recently reported the development of peptide-functionalized, isotopically-barcoded silver NPs (AgNPs) for ultrasensitive studies centered on measuring relative ratios of NP internalization into cultured cells. Here we evaluated the application of this technology for NP homing studies in live mice using peptides with previously described tissue tropism; one peptide that favors vascular beds of the normal lungs (RPARPAR; receptor neuropilin-1, or NRP-1) and another that is selective for central nervous system vessels (CAGALCY). Equimolar mixtures of the peptide-targeted Ag107-NPs and Ag109 control particles were mixed and injected intravenously. Distribution profiles of Ag107 and Ag109 in tissue extracts were determined simultaneously through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Compared to non-targeted particles up to \u223c9-fold increased lung accumulation was seen for RPARPAR-OH AgNPs (but not for AgNPs functionalized with RPARPAR-NH2, which does not bind to NRP-1). Similarly, AgNPs functionalized with the brain-homing CAGALCY peptide were overrepresented in brain extracts. Spatial distribution (mapping) analysis by laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine the ratio Ag107/Ag109 in tissue cryosections.

Intraperitoneal (IP) administration can be used to improve therapeutic index of anticancer drugs used for PC treatment. Activity of IP anticancer drugs can be further potentiated by encapsulation in nanocarriers and/or affinity targeting with tumor-specific affinity ligands, such as tumor homing peptides. Here we evaluated a novel tumor penetrating peptide, linTT1 (AKRGARSTA), as a PC targeting ligand for nanoparticles. We first demonstrated that the primary homing receptor for linTT1, p32 (or gC1qR), is expressed on the cell surface of peritoneal carcinoma cell lines of gastric (MKN-45P), ovarian (SKOV-3), and colon (CT-26) origin, and that peritoneal tumors in mice and clinical peritoneal carcinoma explants express p32 protein accessible from the IP space. Iron oxide nanoworms (NWs) functionalized with the linTT1 peptide were taken up and routed to mitochondria in cultured PC cells. NWs functionalized with linTT1 peptide in tandem with a pro-apoptotic [D(KLAKLAK)2] peptide showed p32-dependent cytotoxicity in MKN-45P, SKOV-3, and CT-26 cells. Upon IP administration in mice bearing MKN-45P, SKOV-3, and CT-26 tumors, linTT1-functionalized NWs showed robust homing and penetration into malignant lesions, whereas only a background accumulation was seen in control tissues. In tumors, the linTT1-NW accumulation was seen predominantly in CD31-positive blood vessels, in LYVE-1-positive lymphatic structures, and in CD11b-positive tumor macrophages. Experimental therapy of mice bearing peritoneal MKN-45P xenografts and CT-26 syngeneic tumors with IP linTT1-D(KLAKLAK)2-NWs resulted in significant reduction of weight of peritoneal tumors and significant decrease in the number of metastatic tumor nodules, whereas treatment with untargeted D(KLAKLAK)2-NWs had no effect. Our data show that targeting of p32 with linTT1 tumor-penetrating peptide improves tumor selectivity and antitumor efficacy of IP pro-apoptotic NWs.

Intraperitoneally administered iRGD significantly enhanced penetration of an attached fluorescein into disseminated peritoneal tumor nodules. The penetration was tumor-specific, circulation-independent, and mediated by the neuropilin-binding RXXK tissue-penetration peptide motif of iRGD. Q-iRGD, which fluoresces upon cleavage, including the one that leads to RXXK activation, specifically labeled peritoneal metastases displaying different growth patterns in mice. Importantly, iRGD enhanced intratumoral entry of intraperitoneally co-injected dextran to approximately 300% and doxorubicin to 250%. Intraperitoneal iRGD/doxorubicin combination therapy inhibited the growth of bulky peritoneal tumors and reduced systemic drug toxicity. iRGD delivered attached fluorescein and co-applied nanoparticles deep into fresh human peritoneal metastasis explants.

Phage library screening in live mice has recently identified homing peptides that specifically recognize the endothelium of tumor vessels, extravasate, and penetrate deep into the extravascular tumor tissue. The prototypic peptide of this class, iRGD (CRGDKGPDC), contains the integrin-binding RGD motif. RGD mediates tumor-homing through binding to \u03b1v integrins, which are selectively expressed on various cells in tumors, including tumor endothelial cells. The tumor-penetrating properties of iRGD are mediated by a second sequence motif, R/KXXR/K. This C-end Rule (or CendR) motif is active only when the second basic residue is exposed at the C-terminus of the peptide. Proteolytic processing of iRGD in tumors activates the cryptic CendR motif, which then binds to neuropilin-1 activating an endocytic bulk transport pathway through tumor tissue. Phage screening has also yielded tumor-penetrating peptides that function like iRGD in activating the CendR pathway, but bind to a different primary receptor. Moreover, novel tumor-homing peptides can be constructed from tumor-homing motifs, CendR elements and protease cleavage sites. Pathologies other than tumors can be targeted with tissue-penetrating peptides, and the primary receptor can also be a vascular \"zip code\" of a normal tissue. The CendR technology provides a solution to a major problem in tumor therapy, poor penetration of drugs into tumors. The tumor-penetrating peptides are capable of taking a payload deep into tumor tissue in mice, and they also penetrate into human tumors ex vivo. Targeting with these peptides specifically increases the accumulation in tumors of a variety of drugs and contrast agents, such as doxorubicin, antibodies, and nanoparticle-based compounds.

We have previously devised a tumor-targeted nanosystem, in which a pentapeptide, CGKRK, delivers a proapoptotic peptide into the mitochondria of tumor blood vessel endothelial cells and tumor cells. The treatment was highly effective in glioblastoma mouse models completely refractory to other antiangiogenic treatments. Here, we identify p32/gC1qR/HABP, a mitochondrial protein that is also expressed at the cell surface of activated (angiogenic) endothelial cells and tumor cells, as a receptor for the CGKRK peptide. The results demonstrate the ability of p32 to cause internalization of a payload bound to p32 into the cytoplasm. We also show that nardilysin, a protease capable of cleaving CGKRK, plays a role in the internalization of a p32-bound payload.

Here, we present proof-of-principle of in vivo selection of human antibodies in tumor-bearing mice that identified a tumor-specific antibody able to deliver a payload and unveils the target antigen. By using an ex vivo enrichment process against freshly disaggregated tumors to purge the repertoire, in combination with in vivo biopanning at optimized phage circulation time, we have identified a human domain antibody capable of mediating selective localization of phage to human prostate cancer xenografts. Affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that the antibody recognizes the proteasome activator complex PA28. The specificity of soluble antibody was confirmed by demonstrating its binding to the active human PA28\u03b1\u03b2 complex. Whereas systemically administered control phage was confined in the lumen of blood vessels of both normal tissues and tumors, the selected phage spread from tumor vessels into the perivascular tumor parenchyma. In these areas, the selected phage partially colocalized with PA28 complex. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the \u03b1 subunit of PA28 [proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1)] is elevated in primary and metastatic human prostate cancer and used anti-PSME1 antibodies to show that PSME1 is an accessible marker in mouse xenograft tumors.

It is over-expressed in the new blood vessels grown by tumor cells and is a target for anti-tumor treatments. Peptides that expose the consensus sequence R/K/XXR/K at the C-terminus (C-end rule or CendR peptides) bind to NRP-1 and are internalized into the cell. We used peptide phage display binding assays and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the potential role of the central residues of CendR peptides in binding and activation of the NRP-1 receptor. The high stability of RPAR-receptor domain complex stems from the formation of a characteristic pattern of three hydrogen bonds between the peptide C-terminus and the residues in the NRP-1 loop III. Any changes in the peptide structure that fail to preserve this triad result in a less-stable complex. We performed a systematic study of RXXR mutants, where X=A/D/S/R/P, in order to test the effect of replacement of A or P on the binding capabilities. Our results, both experimental and computational, show that RRAR, RDAR, RPDR, RPRR and RPPR are capable of binding NRP-1. However, only RPPR and RPRR segments form an optimal organization around loop III with low potential energy. In other analogs, the absence of these stabilizing interactions always results in higher potential energy of the complexes. The binding of RPAR analogs does not guarantee receptor activation; only stable complexes that are properly stabilized via loop III appear able to trigger NRP-1 activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Binding Sites", "Cell Surface Display Techniques", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Neuropilin-1", "Peptides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Stability"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Zanuy", "Affiliation": "Departament d'Enginyeria Qu\u00edmica, E.T.S. d'Enginyeria Industrial de Barcelona, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Diagonal 647, Barcelona E-08028, Spain. david.zanuy@upc.edu"}, {"First Name": "Rohith", "Last Name": "Kotla", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Nussinov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tambet", "Last Name": "Teesalu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuki N", "Last Name": "Sugahara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Alem\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nurit", "Last Name": "Haspel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of structural biology", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23248118", "Title": "Application of a proapoptotic peptide to intratumorally spreading cancer therapy.", "Abstract": "Bit1 is a proapoptotic mitochondrial protein associated with anoikis. Upon cell detachment, Bit1 is released into the cytoplasm and triggers caspase-independent cell death. Bit1 consists of 179 amino acids; for the C-terminal, two thirds of the molecule functions as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, whereas the N-terminus contains a mitochondrial localization signal. Here, we localize the cell death domain (CDD) to the N-terminal 62 amino acids of Bit1 by transfecting cells with truncated Bit1 cDNA constructs. CDD was more potent in killing cells than the full-length Bit1 protein when equivalent amounts of cDNA were transfected. To develop Bit1 CDD into a cancer therapeutic, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of the CDD fused to iRGD, which is a tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. iRGD-CDD internalized into cultured tumor cells through a neuropilin-1-activated pathway and triggered cell death. Importantly, iRGD-CDD spread extensively within the tumor when injected intratumorally into orthotopically implanted breast tumors in mice. Repeated treatment with iRGD-CDD strongly inhibited tumor growth, resulting in an average reduction of 77% in tumor volume and eradication of some tumors. The caspase independence of Bit1-induced cell death makes CDD a potentially attractive anticancer agent, because tumor resistance to the main mechanisms of apoptosis is circumvented. Using iRGD to facilitate the spreading of a therapeutic agent throughout the tumor mass may be a useful adjunct to local therapy for tumors that are surgically inoperable or difficult to treat systemically.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Binding Sites", "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Neuropilin-1", "Oligopeptides", "Peptides", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Transfection", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Renwei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Center for Nanomedicine, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gary B", "Last Name": "Braun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiuquan", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuki N", "Last Name": "Sugahara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tambet", "Last Name": "Teesalu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erkki", "Last Name": "Ruoslahti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2013Feb15"}, {"PMID": "23151901", "Title": "De novo design of a tumor-penetrating peptide.", "Abstract": "Poor penetration of antitumor drugs into the extravascular tumor tissue is often a major factor limiting the efficacy of cancer treatments. Our group has recently described a strategy to enhance tumor penetration of chemotherapeutic drugs through use of iRGD peptide (CRGDK/RGPDC). This peptide comprises two sequence motifs: RGD, which binds to \u03b1v\u03b23/5 integrins on tumor endothelia and tumor cells, and a cryptic CendR motif (R/KXXR/K-OH). Once integrin binding has brought iRGD to the tumor, the peptide is proteolytically cleaved to expose the cryptic CendR motif. The truncated peptide loses affinity for its primary receptor and binds to neuropilin-1, activating a tissue penetration pathway that delivers the peptide along with attached or co-administered payload into the tumor mass. Here, we describe the design of a new tumor-penetrating peptide based on the current knowledge of homing sequences and internalizing receptors. The tumor-homing motif in the new peptide is the NGR sequence, which binds to endothelial CD13. The NGR sequence was placed in the context of a CendR motif (RNGR), and this sequence was embedded in the iRGD framework. The resulting peptide (CRNGRGPDC, iNGR) homed to tumor vessels and penetrated into tumor tissue more effectively than the standard NGR peptide. iNGR induced greater tumor penetration of coupled nanoparticles and co-administered compounds than NGR. Doxorubicin given together with iNGR was significantly more efficacious than the drug alone. These results show that a tumor-specific, tissue-penetrating peptide can be constructed from known sequence elements. This principle may be useful in designing tissue-penetrating peptides for other diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Design", "Humans", "Mice", "Neoplasms", "Oligopeptides", "Protein Binding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Alberici", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lise", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuki N", "Last Name": "Sugahara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lilach", "Last Name": "Agemy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Venkata R", "Last Name": "Kotamraju", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tambet", "Last Name": "Teesalu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claudio", "Last Name": "Bordignon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catia", "Last Name": "Traversari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gian-Paolo", "Last Name": "Rizzardi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erkki", "Last Name": "Ruoslahti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2013Jan15"}]
