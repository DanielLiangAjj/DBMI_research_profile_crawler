Jersey.", "Abstract": "New Jersey was among the first states impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with one of the highest overall death rates in the nation. Nevertheless, relatively few reports have been published focusing specifically on New Jersey. Here we report on molecular, clinical, and epidemiologic observations, from the largest healthcare network in the state, in a cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected in nine hospitals from December 2020 through June 2022, using both whole genome sequencing (WGS) and a real-time RT-PCR screening assay targeting spike protein mutations found in variants of concern (VOCs) within our region. De-identified clinical data were obtained retrospectively, including demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, ICU admission, ventilator support, mortality, and medical history. Statistical analyses were performed to identify associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination status, clinical outcomes, and medical risk factors. A total of 5007 SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were successfully screened and/or sequenced. Variant screening identified three predominant VOCs, including Alpha (n = 714), Delta (n = 1877), and Omicron (n = 1802). Omicron isolates were further sub-typed as BA.1 (n = 899), BA.2 (n = 853), or BA.4/BA.5 (n = 50); the remaining 614 isolates were classified as \"Other\". Approximately 31.5% (1577/5007) of the samples were associated with vaccine breakthrough infections, which increased in frequency following the emergence of Delta and Omicron. Severe clinical outcomes included ICU admission (336/5007 = 6.7%), ventilator support (236/5007 = 4.7%), and mortality (430/5007 = 8.6%), with increasing age being the most significant contributor to each (p < 0.001). Unvaccinated individuals accounted for 79.7% (268/336) of ICU admissions, 78.3% (185/236) of ventilator cases, and 74.4% (320/430) of deaths. Highly significant (p < 0.001) increases in mortality were observed in individuals with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but not with obesity, thyroid disease, or respiratory disease. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in clinical outcomes were also noted between SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2. Vaccination was associated with significantly improved clinical outcomes in our study, despite an increase in breakthrough infections associated with waning immunity, greater antigenic variability, or both.

Real-time RT-PCR-based screening facilitated timely identification of predominant variants using a minimal number of spike protein mutations, with faster turnaround time and reduced cost compared to WGS.

We found that the clustered protocadherin gamma (Pcdhg) gene locus, which encodes 22 cell-surface homophilic binding proteins, is required in somatosensory neurons for normal behavioral reactivity to a range of tactile stimuli. Developmentally, distinct Pcdhg isoforms mediate LTMR synapse formation through neuron-neuron interactions and peripheral axonal branching through neuron-glia interactions. The Pcdhgc3 isoform mediates homophilic interactions between sensory axons and spinal cord neurons to promote synapse formation in\u00a0vivo and is sufficient to induce postsynaptic specializations in\u00a0vitro. Moreover, loss of Pcdhgs and somatosensory synaptic inputs to the dorsal horn leads to fewer corticospinal synapses on dorsal horn neurons. These findings reveal essential roles for Pcdhg isoform diversity in somatosensory neuron synapse formation, peripheral axonal branching, and stepwise assembly of central mechanosensory circuitry.", "Keywords": ["axon", "axonal branching", "circuit wiring", "somatosensory neurons", "spinal cord", "synapse", "\u03b3-protocadherins"], "MeSH terms": ["Sensory Receptor Cells", "Spinal Cord", "Cadherins", "Synapses", "Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn", "Protein Isoforms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Meltzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katelyn C", "Last Name": "Boulanger", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anda M", "Last Name": "Chirila", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuella", "Last Name": "Osei-Asante", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "DeLisle", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian T", "Last Name": "Kalish", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aniqa", "Last Name": "Tasnim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erica L", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leah C", "Last Name": "Fuller", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Iowa Neuroscience Institute, University of Iowa, 143 Biology Building, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erin K", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Zuckerman Institute of Mind Brain and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Zuckerman Institute of Mind Brain and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "Garrett", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Department of Ophthalmology, Visual and Anatomical Sciences, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 540 E.

inflammatory syndrome in children.", "Abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and severe condition that follows benign COVID-19. We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNASEL in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that activate the single-stranded RNA-degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2-5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L-deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L-deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS-RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2-triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C.",

the neutralizing capacity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used to treat COVID-19, as well as antibodies recovered from unvaccinated, previously vaccinated, and infected individuals, against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) remains critical to study. Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. IMPORTANCE The neutralizing capacities of monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 and of those recovered from previously infected and vaccinated individuals against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) remain important questions. We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. We note high attack rates with symptoms in nearly 50% of infected individuals, in sharp contrast to an unrelated institutional outbreak caused by the R.1 variant among a vaccinated population. We found little evidence of significant community spillover. This variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and dampened the neutralization capacity of convalescent-phase plasma from individuals with previous infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. Among three vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs.

We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated health care professionals (HCP). Our postvaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network identified all vaccinated HCPs who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021, 23,687 HCPs received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from nonvaccinated patients during the similar time frame were subjected to VOC screening and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sixty-two percent (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 60% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; percentage of concurrent nonvaccinated samples was 37% (523/1,404) and 20% (284/1,394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any receptor-binding domain (RBD)/N-terminal domain (NTD) polymorphism between groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent VOCs among nonvaccinated populations. IMPORTANCE A number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), continue to be a major concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the administered vaccines is of great concern and a critical question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from partial/fully vaccinated health care professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment. Our findings support the high level of protection provided by full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the nonvaccinated population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment among vaccinated groups.

The accumulation of these mutations could be the consequence of intrahost viral evolution due to prolonged infection in immunocompromised hosts. In this study, we document the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential tracheal aspirates from an immunosuppressed patient on steroids and convalescent plasma therapy and identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the first swab (day 0) and from three tracheal aspirates (days 7, 21, and 27) were compared at the sequence level. We identified a mixed viral population with five different S protein mutations (141 to 144 deletion, 243 to 244 deletion, E484K, Q493K, and Q493R) at the NTD or RBD region from the second tracheal aspirate sample (day 21) and a predominance of the S protein 141 to 144 LGVY deletion and E484K mutant on day 27. The neutralizing antibodies against various S protein lentiviral pseudovirus mutants, as well as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig and IgG, showed \"U\" shape dynamics, in support of the endogenous development of neutralizing antibodies. The patient's compromised immune status, the antirejection regiment, convalescent plasma treatment, and the development of neutralizing antibodies may have resulted in unique selective pressures on the intrahost genomic evolution, and this observation supports the hypotheses that VOCs can independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for immune escape mutants. IMPORTANCE Over a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages have arisen in multiple geographic areas around the world. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), i.e., B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2 (delta), harboring mutations and/or deletions in spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions showed evidence of increased transmissibility and disease severity and possible reduced vaccine efficacy. In this study, we report the emergence of five different NTD and RBD mutations in an uncommon SARS-CoV-2 B.1.369 lineage from an immunosuppressed patient undergoing steroid and convalescent plasma therapy. The observation highlighted that VOCs can independently arise in immunocompromised populations undergoing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy, and enhanced measures will be required to reduce the transmission.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2", "convalescent plasma", "immunosuppression", "spike protein", "variants of concern"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "Humans", "Immunization, Passive", "Immunocompromised Host", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neutralization Tests", "Pandemics", "Protein Binding", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "COVID-19 Serotherapy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Zody", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Di Germanio", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Martinelli", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose R", "Last Name": "Mediavilla", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus H", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaelea", "Last Name": "Composto", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kar Fai", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Medical University Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Milena", "Last Name": "Kordalewska", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9", "Last Name": "Corvelo", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dayna M", "Last Name": "Oschwald", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Fennessey", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marygrace", "Last Name": "Zetkulic", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Medical University Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophia", "Last Name": "Dar", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Medical University Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yael", "Last Name": "Kramer", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Medical University Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barun", "Last Name": "Mathema", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia Universitygrid.21729.3f Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soren", "Last Name": "Germer", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mars", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Graham", "Last Name": "Simmons", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Busch", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Perlin", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry N", "Last Name": "Kreiswirth", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2021Aug25"}, {"PMID": "34099552", "Title": "ALS- and FTD-associated missense mutations in TBK1 differentially disrupt mitophagy.", "Abstract": "TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a multifunctional kinase with an essential role in mitophagy, the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria. More than 90 distinct mutations in TBK1 are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia, including missense mutations that disrupt the abilities of TBK1 to dimerize, associate with the mitophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN), autoactivate, or catalyze phosphorylation. We investigated how ALS-associated mutations in TBK1 affect Parkin-dependent mitophagy using imaging to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in clearing damaged mitochondria. Some mutations cause severe dysregulation of the pathway, while others induce limited disruption. Mutations that abolish either TBK1 dimerization or kinase activity were insufficient to fully inhibit mitophagy, while mutations that reduced both dimerization and kinase activity were more disruptive. Ultimately, both TBK1 recruitment and OPTN phosphorylation at S177 are necessary for engulfment of damaged mitochondra by autophagosomal membranes. Surprisingly, we find that ULK1 activity contributes to the phosphorylation of OPTN in the presence of either wild-type or kinase-inactive TBK1. In primary neurons, TBK1 mutants induce mitochondrial stress under basal conditions; network stress is exacerbated with further mitochondrial insult. Our study further refines the model for TBK1 function in mitophagy, demonstrating that some ALS-linked mutations likely contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing mitochondrial stress or inhibiting mitophagic flux. Other TBK1 mutations exhibited much less impact on mitophagy in our assays, suggesting that cell-type-specific effects, cumulative damage, or alternative TBK1-dependent pathways such as innate immunity and inflammation also factor into the development of ALS in affected individuals.", "Keywords": ["OPTN", "Parkin", "TBK1", "mitophagy", "neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Kinetics", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Mitochondria", "Mitophagy", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation, Missense", "Oxidative Stress", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Olivia", "Last Name": "Harding", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Chantell S", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104."}, {"First Name": "Junqiang", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jonah", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Special Projects Group, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Erika L F", "Last Name": "Holzbaur", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; holzbaur@pennmedicine.upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Jun15"}, {"PMID": "33756103", "Title": "Novel ultra-rare exonic variants identified in a founder population implicate cadherins in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The identification of rare variants associated with schizophrenia has proven challenging due to genetic heterogeneity, which is reduced in founder populations.

arbors that innervate the surrounding territory, enabling the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. The clustered protocadherins (cPCDH), a family of diverse cell-surface homophilic proteins, provide each neuron with a cell specific identity required for distinguishing between self versus non-self. While only 52 unique cPcdh isoforms are encoded in the human genome, a combination of stochastic promoter choice and the formation of a protein lattice through engagement of adjacent cPCDH protein cis/trans-tetramers confer the high degree of cellular specificity required for self-recognition. Studies of mice bearing deletions of individual cPcdh gene clustees have identified deficits in circuit formation and behavior. In humans, single nucleotide variants scattered across the cPCDH locus have been identified, which associate with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. To advance our understanding of cPCDH stochastic choice and maintenance, function across cell types, and contribution to neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis, hiPSC-based models have been developed. Ultimately, integration of human genetic data, biochemical assays, and functional studies is needed to uncover the mechanism underlying neurite repulsion, which has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Protein Isoforms", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erin", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States; Mortimer B.

Vertebrate neural self-avoidance requires the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein isoforms, which act as cell-surface molecular barcodes that mediate highly specific homophilic self-recognition, followed by repulsion. The generation of sufficiently diverse cell-surface barcodes is achieved by the stochastic and combinatorial activation of a subset of clustered Pcdh promoters in individual neurons. This remarkable mechanism leads to the generation of enormous molecular diversity at the cell surface.

These processes facilitate dendritic arborization2,3, prevent formation of autapses4 and allow free interaction among non-self neurons1,2,4,5. Avoidance among self neurites is mediated by stochastic cell-surface expression of combinations of about 60 isoforms of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-clustered protocadherin that provide mammalian neurons with single-cell identities1,2,4-13. Avoidance is observed between neurons that express identical protocadherin repertoires2,5, and single-isoform differences are sufficient to prevent self-recognition10. Protocadherins form isoform-promiscuous cis dimers and isoform-specific homophilic trans dimers10,14-20. Although these interactions have previously been characterized in isolation15,17-20, structures of full-length protocadherin ectodomains have not been determined, and how these two interfaces engage in self-recognition between neuronal surfaces remains unknown. Here we determine the molecular arrangement of full-length clustered protocadherin ectodomains in single-isoform self-recognition complexes, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron tomography. We determine the crystal structure of the clustered protocadherin \u03b3B4 ectodomain, which reveals a zipper-like lattice that is formed by alternating cis and trans interactions. Using cryo-electron tomography, we show that clustered protocadherin \u03b3B6 ectodomains tethered to liposomes spontaneously assemble into linear arrays at membrane contact sites, in a configuration that is consistent with the assembly observed in the crystal structure. These linear assemblies pack against each other as parallel arrays to form larger two-dimensional structures between membranes. Our results suggest that the formation of ordered linear assemblies by clustered protocadherins represents the initial self-recognition step in neuronal avoidance, and thus provide support for the isoform-mismatch chain-termination model of protocadherin-mediated self-recognition, which depends on these linear chains11.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Liposomes", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Neurons", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protocadherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kerry M", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex J", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Micah", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Venkata P", "Last Name": "Dandey", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Bepler", "Affiliation": "Computational and Systems Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clinton S", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. bh6@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. lss8@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019May"}, {"PMID": "30955885", "Title": "Antisense lncRNA Transcription Mediates DNA Demethylation to Drive Stochastic Protocadherin \u03b1 Promoter Choice.", "Abstract": "Stochastic activation of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 genes generates a cell-surface identity code in individual neurons that functions in neural circuit assembly.

To investigate whether this response is protective or detrimental, we generated mice in which the critical autophagy gene Atg7 was specifically disrupted in motor neurons (Atg7 cKO). Atg7 cKO mice were viable but exhibited structural and functional defects at a subset of vulnerable neuromuscular junctions. By crossing Atg7 cKO mice to the SOD1G93A mouse model, we found that autophagy inhibition accelerated early neuromuscular denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle and the onset of hindlimb tremor. Surprisingly, however, lifespan was extended in Atg7 cKO; SOD1G93A double-mutant mice. Autophagy inhibition did not prevent motor neuron cell death, but it reduced glial inflammation and blocked activation of the stress-related transcription factor c-Jun in spinal interneurons.

We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Cadherins", "Depression", "Gene Deletion", "Limbic System", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Multigene Family", "Serotonergic Neurons", "Serotonin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Weisheng V", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chiamaka L", "Last Name": "Nwakeze", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Denny", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "O'Keeffe", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Rieger", "Affiliation": "Departments of Genetics and Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Mountoufaris", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Kirner", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Dougherty", "Affiliation": "Departments of Genetics and Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Center for Comparative Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. tm2472@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2017Apr28"}, {"PMID": "27782885", "Title": "\u03b3-Protocadherin structural diversity and functional implications.", "Abstract": "Stochastic cell-surface expression of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) provides vertebrate neurons with single-cell identities that underlie neuronal self-recognition.

We observed the presence of MPS in all of the tested neuronal types cultured from mouse central and peripheral nervous systems, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons from several brain regions, as well as sensory and motor neurons. Quantitative analyses show that MPS is preferentially formed in axons in all neuronal types tested here: Spectrin shows a long-range, periodic distribution throughout all axons but appears periodic only in a small fraction of dendrites, typically in the form of isolated patches in subregions of these dendrites. As in dendrites, we also observed patches of periodic spectrin structures in a small fraction of glial-cell processes in four types of glial cells cultured from rodent tissues. Interestingly, despite its strong presence in the axonal shaft, MPS is disrupted in most presynaptic boutons but is present in an appreciable fraction of dendritic spine necks, including some projecting from dendrites where such a periodic structure is not observed in the shaft.

We report that all three subfamilies of clustered Pcdhs can engage in specific homophilic interactions, that cell surface delivery of Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms requires cis interactions with other Pcdhs, and that the extracellular cadherin domain EC6 plays a critical role in this process. Examination of homophilic interactions between specific combinations of multiple Pcdh isoforms revealed that Pcdh combinatorial recognition specificities depend on the identity of all of the expressed isoforms.

Approximately 4% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in TDP-43. The majority of these mutations are found in the glycine-rich domain, including the variant M337V, which is one of the most common mutations in TDP-43. In order to investigate the use of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential therapeutic tool, we designed and screened a set of siRNAs that specifically target TDP-43(M337V) mutation. Two siRNA specifically silenced the M337V mutation in HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-TDP-43(wt) or GFP-TDP-43(M337V) or TDP-43 C-terminal fragments counterparts. C-terminal TDP-43 transfected cells show an increase of cytosolic inclusions, which are decreased after allele-specific siRNA in M337V cells. We then investigated the effects of one of these allele-specific siRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an ALS patient carrying the M337V mutation. These lines showed a two-fold increase in cytosolic TDP-43 compared to the control. Following transfection with the allele-specific siRNA, cytosolic TDP-43 was reduced by 30% compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA.

Bioinformatics analyses identified changes in the expression of specific genes and signaling pathways that may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, among which are TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "Proteoglycans", "Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Spinal Cord", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hemali P", "Last Name": "Phatnani", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Guarnieri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brad A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monica A", "Last Name": "Carrasco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Muratet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "O'Keeffe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiamaka", "Last Name": "Nwakeze", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Florencia", "Last Name": "Pauli-Behn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kimberly M", "Last Name": "Newberry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah K", "Last Name": "Meadows", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan Carlos", "Last Name": "Tapia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Feb19"}, {"PMID": "23303937", "Title": "Accelerated high-yield generation of limb-innervating motor neurons from human stem cells.", "Abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells are a promising source of differentiated cells for developmental studies, cell transplantation, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, their widespread use even for intensely studied cell types like spinal motor neurons is hindered by the long duration and low yields of existing protocols for in vitro differentiation and by the molecular heterogeneity of the populations generated. We report a combination of small molecules that within 3 weeks induce motor neurons at up to 50% abundance and with defined subtype identities of relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Despite their accelerated differentiation, motor neurons expressed combinations of HB9, ISL1, and column-specific markers that mirror those observed in vivo in human embryonic spinal cord. They also exhibited spontaneous and induced activity, and projected axons toward muscles when grafted into developing chick spinal cord. Strikingly, this novel protocol preferentially generates motor neurons expressing markers of limb-innervating lateral motor column motor neurons (FOXP1(+)/LHX3(-)). Access to high-yield cultures of human limb-innervating motor neuron subtypes will facilitate in-depth study of motor neuron subtype-specific properties, disease modeling, and development of large-scale cell-based screening assays.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Chick Embryo", "DNA, Complementary", "Extremities", "Female", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Male", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "Neural Stem Cells", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "RNA-Induced Silencing Complex", "Repressor Proteins", "Spinal Cord", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mackenzie W", "Last Name": "Amoroso", "Affiliation": "Project A.L.S./Jenifer Estess Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gist F", "Last Name": "Croft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Damian J", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "O'Keeffe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monica A", "Last Name": "Carrasco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne R", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "Roybon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Derek H", "Last Name": "Oakley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hynek", "Last Name": "Wichterle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Jan09"}]
