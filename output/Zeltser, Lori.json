The issue of what determines the direction of stress-induced feeding responses has not been directly addressed in animal models, but assays that combine stress with a feeding-related task are commonly used as readouts of other behaviors, such as anxiety. Sex, estrous cyclicity, circadian cyclicity, caloric restriction, palatable diets, elevated body weight, and properties of the stressors similarly influence feeding behavior in humans and rodent models.

In this Perspective, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates POMC neuronal heterogeneity with appetite regulation, whole-body metabolic physiology and the development of obesity. We highlight emerging evidence indicating that POMC neurons respond to distinct combinations of interoceptive signals and food-related cues to fine-tune divergent metabolic pathways and behaviours necessary for survival.

Most of the enmeshed neurons are both GABAergic and leptin receptor-positive, including a majority of Agrp neurons. Postnatal formation of the PNN-like structures coincides precisely with closure of the CP for Agrp neuron maturation and is dependent on input from circulating leptin, as postnatal ob/ob mice have reduced ARC PNN-like material that is restored by leptin administration during the CP.

However, how specific intracellular machinery controls peptidergic identities and function of individual hypothalamic neurons remains largely unknown. The transcription factor T-box 3 (Tbx3) is expressed in hypothalamic neurons sensing and governing energy status, whereas human TBX3 haploinsufficiency has been linked with obesity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Tbx3 function in hypothalamic neurons causes weight gain and other metabolic disturbances by disrupting both the peptidergic identity and plasticity of Pomc/Cart and Agrp/Npy neurons. These alterations are observed after loss of Tbx3 in both immature hypothalamic neurons and terminally differentiated mouse neurons. We further establish the importance of Tbx3 for body weight regulation in Drosophila melanogaster and show that TBX3 is implicated in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hypothalamic Pomc neurons. Our data indicate that Tbx3 directs the terminal specification of neurons as functional components of the melanocortin system and is required for maintaining their peptidergic identity.

Insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2-cells express the machinery for DA synthesis and catabolism, as well as all five DA receptors. In these cells, DA functions as a negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which is mediated by DA D2-like receptors including D2 (D2R) and D3 (D3R) receptors. However, the fundamental mechanisms of DA synthesis, storage, release, and signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and their functional relevance in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the roles of the DA precursor L-DOPA in \u03b2-cell DA synthesis and release in conjunction with the signaling mechanisms underlying DA's inhibition of GSIS. Our results show that the uptake of L-DOPA is essential for establishing intracellular DA stores in \u03b2-cells. Glucose stimulation significantly enhances L-DOPA uptake, leading to increased DA release and GSIS reduction in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Furthermore, D2R and D3R act in combination to mediate dopaminergic inhibition of GSIS. Transgenic knockout mice in which \u03b2-cell D2R or D3R expression is eliminated exhibit diminished DA secretion during glucose stimulation, suggesting a new mechanism where D2-like receptors modify DA release to modulate GSIS. Lastly, \u03b2-cell-selective D2R knockout mice exhibit marked postprandial hyperinsulinemia in vivo. These results reveal that peripheral D2R and D3R receptors play important roles in metabolism through their inhibitory effects on GSIS. This opens the possibility that blockade of peripheral D2-like receptors by drugs including antipsychotic medications may significantly contribute to the metabolic disturbances observed clinically.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dopamine", "Insulin Secretion", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Mice", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Receptors, Dopamine D3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zachary J", "Last Name": "Farino", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Travis J", "Last Name": "Morgenstern", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonella", "Last Name": "Maffei", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alain J", "Last Name": "De Solis", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pattama", "Last Name": "Wiriyasermkul", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robin J", "Last Name": "Freyberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Despoina", "Last Name": "Aslanoglou", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Denise", "Last Name": "Sorisio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin P", "Last Name": "Inbar", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "R Benjamin", "Last Name": "Free", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuropharmacology Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Prashant", "Last Name": "Donthamsetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eugene V", "Last Name": "Mosharov", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Kellendonk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gary J", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Sibley", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuropharmacology Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Schmauss", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori M", "Last Name": "Zeltser", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Holly", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul E", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zachary", "Last Name": "Freyberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. freyberg@pitt.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "30282043", "Title": "Distinct Hypothalamic and Brainstem Contributions to Lorcaserin Action.", "Abstract": "Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons regulate energy balance and mediate the effects of some classes of anti-obesity therapeutics.

A lack of effective options for long-term weight reduction magnifies the enormity of this problem; individuals who successfully complete behavioral and dietary weight-loss programs eventually regain most of the lost weight. We included evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess current knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying excess body-fat accumulation, the biological defense of excess fat mass, and the tendency for lost weight to be regained. A major area of emphasis is the science of energy homeostasis, the biological process that maintains weight stability by actively matching energy intake to energy expenditure over time. Growing evidence suggests that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight. We need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this \"upward setting\" or \"resetting\" of the defended level of body-fat mass, whether inherited or acquired. The ongoing study of how genetic, developmental, and environmental forces affect the energy homeostasis system will help us better understand these mechanisms and are therefore a major focus of this statement.

HFD attenuated leptin sensing throughout the brain, but weight loss did not restore central leptin signaling to control levels in several brain regions important in energy homeostasis, including the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. Effects of diet on leptin signaling varied by brain region, with results dependent on the method of weight loss (restriction of calories of HFD, ad lib intake of standard mouse chow). High fat diet attenuates leptin signaling throughout the brain, but some brain regions maintain their ability to sense leptin.

L(2.1)KOs are hyperphagic and obese, whereas I(2.1)KOs are similar to controls. D(2.1)KOs exhibit higher body weight and adiposity than L(2.1)KOs, solely due to reduced energy expenditure. At 20-22\u00b0C, fed L(2.1)KOs maintain a lower baseline Tc than controls, which is further decreased in D(2.1)KOs. After an overnight fast, some L(2.1)KOs dramatically suppress energy expenditure and enter a torpor-like state; this behavior is markedly enhanced in D(2.1)KOs. When fasted mice are exposed to 4\u00b0C, L(2.1)KOs and D(2.1)KOs both mount a robust thermogenic response and rapidly increase Tc.

Accordingly, neurons that contribute to feeding behaviors are localized to central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems. To promote energy balance, feeding circuits must be able to identify and respond to energy requirements, as well as the amount of energy available from internal and external sources, and then direct appropriate coordinated responses throughout the body.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Energy Intake", "Energy Metabolism", "Feeding Behavior", "Humans", "Neurons", "Neurosecretory Systems", "Signal Transduction", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gary J", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori M", "Last Name": "Zeltser", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annual review of nutrition", "PubDate": "2013"}]
