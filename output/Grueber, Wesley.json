The role of MFN2 in mitochondrial transport has however remained elusive. Like MFN2, acetylated microtubules play key roles in mitochondria dynamics. Nevertheless, it is unknown if the \u03b1-tubulin acetylation cycle functionally interacts with MFN2. Here, we show that mitochondrial contacts with microtubules are sites of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation, which occurs through MFN2-mediated recruitment of \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1). This activity is critical for MFN2-dependent regulation of mitochondria transport, and axonal degeneration caused by CMT2A MFN2 associated R94W and T105M mutations may depend on the inability to release ATAT1 at sites of mitochondrial contacts with microtubules.

Drosophila Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam2) undergoes cell type-specific alternative splicing to produce two isoform-specific homophilic binding proteins. Regulated alternative splicing of Dscam2 is important for dendrite and axon patterning, but how this translates to circuit wiring and animal behavior is not well understood. Here, we examined the role of cell-type specific expression of Dscam2 isoforms in regulating synaptic partner selection in the larval somatosensory system. We found that synaptic partners in the nociceptive circuit express different Dscam2 isoforms. Forcing synaptic partners to express a common isoform resulted in nociceptive axon patterning defects and attenuated nocifensive behaviors, indicating that a role for Dscam2 alternative splicing is to ensure that synaptic partners do not express matching isoforms.

We further found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins, which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred protection from paclitaxel-induced cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins. Paclitaxel-induced changes in recycling endosomes precede morphological degeneration of nociceptive neuron arbors, which could be prevented by integrin overexpression. We used primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuron cultures to test conservation of integrin-mediated protection. We show that transduction of a human integrin \u03b2-subunit 1 also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment.

We demonstrate this deformation encoding both during progression of contraction waves during locomotion as well as during less stereotyped, asymmetric exploration behavior.

Electron microscopic circuit reconstruction shows that DnBs are targets of nociceptive and mechanosensory neurons, are directly presynaptic to pre-motor circuits, and link indirectly to Goro rolling command-like neurons.

Despite their conservation across species, the anatomy, circuitry, and development of internal sensory systems are still relatively poorly understood. A largely unstudied population of larval Drosophila sensory neurons, termed tracheal dendrite (td) neurons, innervate internal respiratory organs and may serve as a model for understanding the sensing of internal states. Here, we characterize the peripheral anatomy, central axon projection, and diversity of td sensory neurons. We provide evidence for prominent expression of specific gustatory receptor genes in distinct populations of td neurons, suggesting novel chemosensory functions. We identify two anatomically distinct classes of td neurons. The axons of one class project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain, whereas the other terminates in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We identify expression and a developmental role of the POU-homeodomain transcription factor Pdm3 in regulating the axon extension and terminal targeting of SEZ-projecting td neurons. Remarkably, ectopic Pdm3 expression is alone sufficient to switch VNC-targeting axons to SEZ targets, and to induce the formation of putative synapses in these ectopic target zones. Our data thus define distinct classes of td neurons, and identify a molecular factor that contributes to diversification of axon targeting. These results introduce a tractable model to elucidate molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying sensory processing of internal body status and physiological homeostasis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How interoceptive sensory circuits develop, including how sensory neurons diversify and target distinct central regions, is still poorly understood, despite the importance of these sensory systems for maintaining physiological homeostasis. Here, we characterize classes of Drosophila internal sensory neurons (td neurons) and uncover diverse axonal projections and expression of chemosensory receptor genes. We categorize td neurons into two classes based on dichotomous axon target regions, and identify the expression and role of the transcription factor Pdm3 in mediating td axon targeting to one of these target regions. Our results provide an entry point into studying internal sensory circuit development and function, and establish Pdm3 as a regulator of interoceptive axon targeting.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila", "axon patterning", "interoceptive", "pdm3", "subesophageal zone", "tracheal dendrite"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Body Patterning", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Neurogenesis", "POU Domain Factors", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Trachea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng Sam", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, sq2141@columbia.edu wg2135@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Margarita", "Last Name": "Kaplow", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer K", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Wesley B", "Last Name": "Grueber", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, sq2141@columbia.edu wg2135@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Feb21"}, {"PMID": "28223318", "Title": "A Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome exhibits defects in phagocytosis by innate immune cells.", "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome, the most common known monogenic cause of autism, results from the loss of FMR1, a conserved, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein.

Pdm1 and Pdm2 are expressed in a subset of proprioceptive sensory neurons and function to inhibit dendrite growth and branching. A subset of touch receptors show a capacity to express Pdm1/2, but Cut represses this expression and promotes more complex dendritic arbors. Levels of Cut expression are diversified in distinct sensory neurons by selective expression of Scalloped and Vestigial.
