However, IgG has potent immune-stimulatory effects in other settings (antibody-mediated immune enhancement [AMIE]). The dominant thinking has been that IgG causes AMIS for antigens on RBCs but AMIE for soluble antigens. However, we have recently reported that IgG against RBC antigens can cause either AMIS or AMIE as a function of an IgG subclass. Recent advances in mechanistic understanding have demonstrated that RBC alloimmunization requires the IFN-\u03b1/-\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) and is inhibited by the complement C3 protein. Here, we demonstrate the opposite for AMIE of an RBC alloantigen (IFNAR is not required and C3 enhances). RBC clearance, C3 deposition, and antigen modulation all preceded AMIE, and both CD4+ T cells and marginal zone B cells were required. We detected no significant increase in antigen-specific germinal center B cells, consistent with other studies of RBC alloimmunization that show extrafollicular-like responses. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence of an RBC alloimmunization pathway which is IFNAR independent and C3 dependent, thus further advancing our understanding of RBCs as an immunogen and AMIE as a phenomenon.", "Keywords": ["Adaptive immunity", "Immunology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Complement C3", "Lymphoid Tissue", "B-Lymphocytes", "Erythrocytes", "Immunoglobulin G", "Interferon-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arijita", "Last Name": "Jash", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Pridmore", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "James B", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ariel M", "Last Name": "Hay", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chance John", "Last Name": "Luckey", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville Virginia, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2024Apr15"}, {"PMID": "38270470", "Title": "Exploring unconventional attributes of red blood cells and their potential applications in biomedicine.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Erythrocytes", "Humans", "Animals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alkmini T", "Last Name": "Anastasiadi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Patras, 26504 Patras, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Vasiliki-Zoi", "Last Name": "Arvaniti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Patras, 26504 Patras, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anastasios G", "Last Name": "Kriebardis", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Reliability and Quality Control in Laboratory Hematology (HemQcR), Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health & Caring Sciences, University of West Attica (UniWA), 12243 Egaleo, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Constantinos", "Last Name": "Stathopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Patras, 26504 Patras, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 13001 Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vassilis L", "Last Name": "Tzounakas", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Patras, 26504 Patras, Greece."}], "Journal": "Protein & cell", "PubDate": "2024May07"}, {"PMID": "38260479", "Title": "Biological and Genetic Determinants of Glycolysis: Phosphofructokinase Isoforms Boost Energy Status of Stored Red Blood Cells and Transfusion Outcomes.", "Abstract": "Mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack mitochondria, and thus exclusively rely on glycolysis to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during aging in vivo or storage in the blood bank.

Reductions in HDFN due to anti-RhD antibodies have been achieved through use of Rh immune globulin (RhIg), a polyclonal antibody preparation that causes antibody-mediated immunosuppression (AMIS), thereby preventing maternal immune responses against fetal RBCs. Despite the success of RhIg, it is only effective against 1 alloantigen. The lack of similar interventions that mitigate immune responses toward other RBC alloantigens reflects an incomplete understanding of AMIS mechanisms. AMIS has been previously attributed to rapid antibody-mediated RBC removal, resulting in B-cell ignorance of the RBC alloantigen. However, our data demonstrate that antibody-mediated RBC removal can enhance de novo alloimmunization. In contrast, inclusion of antibodies that possess the ability to rapidly remove the target antigen in the absence of detectable RBC clearance can convert an augmented antibody response to AMIS. These results suggest that the ability of antibodies to remove target antigens from the RBC surface can trigger AMIS in situations in which enhanced immunity may otherwise occur. In doing so, these results hold promise in identifying key antibody characteristics that can drive AMIS, thereby facilitating the design of AMIS approaches toward other RBC antigens to eliminate all forms of HDFN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Infant, Newborn", "Humans", "Erythrocytes", "Antibodies", "Immune Tolerance", "Erythroblastosis, Fetal", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Rho(D) Immune Globulin", "Isoantigens", "Isoantibodies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan P", "Last Name": "Jajosky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Kashyap R", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jerry William L", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia E", "Last Name": "Zerra", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Satheesh", "Last Name": "Chonat", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Diyoly", "Last Name": "Ayona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl L", "Last Name": "Maier", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Dominique", "Last Name": "Morais", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Shang-Chuen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "C John", "Last Name": "Luckey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie C", "Last Name": "Eisenbarth", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "Roback", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Ross M", "Last Name": "Fasano", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Cassandra D", "Last Name": "Josephson", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Manis", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Chai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY."}, {"First Name": "Connie M", "Last Name": "Arthur", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Stowell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2023Sep21"}, {"PMID": "37078267", "Title": "Reticulocytes in donor blood units enhance red blood cell alloimmunization.", "Abstract": "Although red blood cell (RBC) transfusions save lives, some patients develop clinically-significant alloantibodies against donor blood group antigens, which then have adverse effects in multiple clinical settings.

Previous studies suggested that CD4 T-cell responses that drive alloantibody formation recognize the same alloantigen engaged by B cells. However, because RBCs express numerous antigens, both internally and externally, it is possible that CD4 T-cell responses directed against intracellular antigens may facilitate subsequent alloimmunization against a surface RBC antigen. Here, we show that B cells can acquire intracellular antigens from RBCs. Using a mouse model of donor RBCs expressing 2 distinct alloantigens, we demonstrate that immune priming to an intracellular antigen, which would not be detected by any currently used RBC compatibility assays, can directly influence alloantibody formation after exposure to a subsequent distinct surface RBC alloantigen.

Immune tolerance mechanisms regulate autoreactive T and B cells, yet some lymphocytes escape and promote autoantibody production. CD4+ T cell dysregulation, characterized by decreased or impaired regulatory cells (Tregs) and/or accumulation of memory and effector T cells such as TH17, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Antinuclear antibody (ANAs) testing is used as a first step for the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders, although most ANA-positive individuals do not have nor will develop an autoimmune disease. Studying the differences of T cell compartment among healthy blood donors, ANA-negative patients and ANA-positive patients, in which loss of tolerance have not led to autoimmunity, may improve our understanding on how tolerance mechanisms fail. Herein, we report that ANA-positive patients exhibit a distinct distribution of T cell subsets: significantly reduced frequencies of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) and na\u00efve T cells, and significantly increased frequencies of central memory T cells, TH2 and TH17 cells; modulations within the T cell compartment are most profound within the 18-40 year age range. Moreover, CD4+ T cells in ANA-positive patients are metabolically active, as determined by a significant increase in mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals, compared to ANA-negative patients and healthy blood donors.

Unexpectedly, anti-D fails in some cases and some monoclonal anti-D preparations paradoxically enhances alloimmunization. The underlying mechanisms modulating humoral alloimmunization by anti-D are unknown. We previously reported that IgG antibody subclasses differentially regulate alloimmunity in response to red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in a mouse model; in particular, IgG2c significantly enhanced RBC alloantibody responses. Initial mechanistic studies revealed that IgG2c:RBC immune complexes were preferentially consumed by the splenic dendritic cell (DC) subsets that play a role in RBC alloimmunization. The deletion of activating Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) (i.e., Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIII, and Fc\u03b3RIV) on DCs abrogated IgG2c-mediated enhanced alloimmunization. Because DCs express high levels of Fc\u03b3RIV, which has high affinity for the IgG2c subclass, we hypothesized that Fc\u03b3RIV was required for enhanced alloimmunization. To test this hypothesis, knockout mice and blocking antibodies were used to manipulate Fc\u03b3R expression. The data presented herein demonstrate that Fc\u03b3RIV, but not Fc\u03b3RI or Fc\u03b3RIII, is required for IgG2c-mediated enhancement of RBC alloantibody production. Additionally, Fc\u03b3RI is alone sufficient for IgG2c-mediated RBC clearance but not for increased alloimmunization, demonstrating that RBC clearance can occur without inducing alloimmunization. Together, these data, combined with prior observations, support the hypothesis that passive immunization with an RBC-specific IgG2c antibody increases RBC alloantibody production through Fc\u03b3RIV ligation on splenic conventional DCs (cDCs). This raises the question of whether standardizing antibody subclasses in immunoprophylaxis preparations is desirable and suggests which subclasses may be optimal for generating monoclonal anti-D therapeutics.", "Keywords": ["Fc receptor", "alloantibody", "antibody", "antibody mediated enhancement", "red blood cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune", "Animals", "Antibodies, Blocking", "Antigen-Antibody Complex", "Immunoglobulin G", "Isoantibodies", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anabel", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Flavia Dei", "Last Name": "Zotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Manjula", "Last Name": "Santhanakrishnan", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Tredicine", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Section of General Pathology, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Stowell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chance John", "Last Name": "Luckey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Carter Immunology Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35670632", "Title": "Retention of functional mitochondria in mature red blood cells from patients with sickle cell disease.", "Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by sickled red blood cells (RBCs), which are more sensitive to haemolysis and can contribute to disease pathophysiology.

Dietary PUFAs are readily incorporated into the RBC membrane, improving RBC deformability, fluidity, and hydration. However, enriching the lipid membrane with PUFAs increases the potential for peroxidation in oxidative environments (e.g., refrigerated storage), resulting in membrane damage. Substitution of bis-allylic hydrogens with deuterium ions in PUFAs decreases hydrogen abstraction, thereby inhibiting peroxidation. If lipid peroxidation is a causal factor in the RBC storage lesion, incorporation of deuterated linoleic acid (DLA) into the RBC membrane should decrease lipid peroxidation, thereby improving RBC lifespan, deformability, filterability, and post-transfusion recovery (PTR) after cold storage. Study Design and Methods: Mice associated with good (C57BL/6J) and poor (FVB) RBC storage quality received diets containing 11,11-D2-LA Ethyl Ester (1.0\u00a0g/100\u00a0g diet; deuterated linoleic acid) or non-deuterated LA Ethyl Ester (control) for 8\u00a0weeks. Deformability, filterability, lipidomics, and lipid peroxidation markers were evaluated in fresh and stored RBCs. Results: DLA was incorporated into RBC membranes in both mouse strains.

We previously reported that sterile, stored mouse RBCs activate splenic dendritic cells (DCs), which are required for alloimmunization. Here we transfused mice with allogeneic RBCs to test whether stored RBCs activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on recipient DCs to induce adaptive immunity. TLRs are a class of PRRs that regulate DC activation, which signal through two adapter molecules: MyD88 and TRIF.

Patients with AIHA present with pallor, fatigue, decreased hematocrit, and splenomegaly. While secondary AIHA is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, infections, and more recently, as an adverse event secondary to cancer immunotherapy, the etiology of primary AIHA is unknown. Several therapeutic strategies are available; however, there are currently no licensed treatments for AIHA and few therapeutics offer treatment-free durable remission. Moreover, supportive care with RBC transfusions can be challenging as most autoantibodies are directed against ubiquitous RBC antigens; thus, virtually all RBC donor units are incompatible. Given the severity of AIHA and the lack of treatment options, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that facilitate the breakdown in tolerance would provide insight into new therapeutics. Herein, we report a new murine model of primary AIHA that reflects the biology observed in patients with primary AIHA. Production of anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies correlated with sex and age, and led to RBC antigen modulation, complement fixation, and anemia, as determined by decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin values and increased reticulocytes in peripheral blood. Moreover, autoantibody-producing animals developed splenomegaly, with altered splenic architecture characterized by expanded white pulp areas and nearly diminished red pulp areas. Additional analysis suggested that compensatory extramedullary erythropoiesis occurred as there were increased frequencies of RBC progenitors detectable in the spleen. No significant correlations between AIHA onset and inflammatory status or microbiome were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a murine model that replicates observations made in humans with idiopathic AIHA. Thus, this is a tractable murine model of AIHA that can serve as a platform to identify key cellular and molecular pathways that are compromised, thereby leading to autoantibody formation, as well as testing new therapeutics and management strategies.", "Keywords": ["RBC (red-blood-cell)", "autoimmune disease", "autoimmune hemolytic anemia", "erythrocyte", "idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia", "primary autoimmune hemolytic anemia", "red blood cell", "tolerance"], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Flavia", "Last Name": "Dei Zotti", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "La Carpia", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34633666", "Title": "Hemolytic anemia blunts the cytokine response to transfusion of older red blood cells in mice and dogs.", "Abstract": "Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) stored for longer durations induces hemolysis and inflammatory cytokine production in murine and canine models.

Using a model in which the human KEL glycoprotein is expressed on murine red blood cells (RBCs), we have shown that polyclonal immunoprophylaxis (KELIg) prevents alloimmunization to transfused RBCs when a recipient is in their baseline state of heath but with immunoprophylaxis failure occurring in the presence of a viral-like stimulus. As complement can be detected on antibody coated KEL RBCs following transfusion, we hypothesized that recipient complement synergizes with viral-like inflammation to reduce immunoprophylaxis efficacy. Indeed, we found recipient C3 and C1q were critical to immunoprophylaxis failure in the setting of a viral-like stimulus, with no anti-KEL IgG alloantibodies generated in C3-/- or C1q-/- mice following KELIg treatment and KEL RBC transfusion. Differences in RBC uptake were noted in mice lacking C3, with lower consumption by splenic and peripheral blood inflammatory monocytes. Finally, no alloantibodies were detected in the setting of a viral-like stimulus following KELIg treatment and KEL RBC transfusion in mice lacking complement receptors (CR1/2-/-), narrowing key cells for immunoprophylaxis failure to those expressing these complement receptors.

Exploratory studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection on the plasma metabolome have been performed, often with small numbers of patients, and with or without relevant control data; however, determining the impact of biological and clinical variables remains critical to understanding potential markers of disease severity and progression. The present large study, including relevant controls, sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n\u2009=\u2009831), testing positive (n\u2009=\u2009543) or negative (n\u2009=\u2009288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on 831 plasma samples from acutely ill patients while in the emergency department, at admission, and during hospitalization. We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding\u2009~\u200978% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Imo", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Cendali", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Fabia", "Last Name": "Gamboni", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Kiruphagaran", "Last Name": "Thangaraju", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Katneni", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Stacie", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Valk", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Eldad", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2021May10"}, {"PMID": "33974559", "Title": "A randomized double-blind controlled trial of convalescent plasma in adults with severe COVID-19.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDAlthough convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are limited.METHODSWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19 at 5 sites in New York City (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival. A possible explanation is that survivors remained hospitalized at their baseline clinical status.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04359810.FUNDINGAmazon Foundation, Skoll Foundation.",

known to be capable of inducing robust humoral alloantibody responses both in transfusion and pregnancy. However, the majority of transfusion recipients and pregnant women never make alloantibodies, even after repeat exposure to foreign RBCs. More recently, RBCs have been used as a cellular therapeutic-very much like transfusion, engineered RBCs are highly immunogenic in some cases but not others. In animal models of both transfusion and RBC based therapeutics, RBCs that do not induce an immune response also cause tolerance. Despite a robust phenomenology, the mechanisms of what regulates immunity vs. tolerance to RBCs remains unclear. However, it has been reported that copy number of alloantigens on the RBCs is a critical factor, with a very low copy number causing non-responsiveness (in both humans and mice) and also leading to tolerance in mice. Recently, we reported that an IgG2c specific for an RBC antigen can substantially enhance the humoral immune response upon transfusion of RBCs expressing that antigen. Herein, we report that an IgG2c converts RBCs with low antigen copy number from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic stimulus. These findings report the first known stimulus that induces humoral alloimmunization to a low copy number RBC alloantigen and identify a previously undescribed molecular switch that has the ability to affect responder vs. non-responder phenotypes of transfusion recipients.", "Keywords": ["alloantibody", "alloimmunization", "antibody-mediated enhancement", "red blood cell", "tolerance"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Epitopes", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Gene Dosage", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunity, Humoral", "Immunoglobulin G", "Isoantibodies", "Isoantigens", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arijita", "Last Name": "Jash", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Carter Immunology Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chomkan", "Last Name": "Usaneerungrueng", "Affiliation": "Bloodworks NW Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Heather L", "Last Name": "Howie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Carter Immunology Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chance John", "Last Name": "Luckey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Carter Immunology Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Carter Immunology Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33650699", "Title": "Targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) to treat autoimmune diseases and maternal-fetal immune cytopenias.", "Abstract": "FcRn, a non-classical Fc gamma (\u03b3) receptor (Fc\u03b3R) with near ubiquitous expression, plays key roles in disease pathogenesis and progression though immunoglobulin G (IgG) transport, IgG recycling, and IgG-immune complex clearance.

These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.

Donor derived anti-RhD IgG has been used for over 50 years as an immunoprophylactic to prevent maternal alloimmunization to RhD. Although anti-RhD has dramatically decreased rates of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (for the RhD alloantigen), anti-RhD also fails in some cases, and can even paradoxically enhance immune responses in some circumstances. Attempts to generate a monoclonal anti-RhD have largely failed, with some monoclonals suppressing less than donor derived anti-RhD and others enhancing immunity. These difficulties likely result, in part, because the mechanism of anti-RhD remains unclear. However, substantial evidence exists to reject the common explanations of simple clearance of RhD + RBCs or masking of antigen. Donor derived anti-RhD is a mixture of 4 different IgG subtypes. To the best of our knowledge an analysis of the role different IgG subtypes play in immunoregulation has not been carried out; and, only IgG1 and IgG3 have been tested as monoclonals. Multiple attempts to elicit alloimmune responses to human RhD epitopes in mice have failed. To circumvent this limitation, we utilize a tractable animal model of RBC alloimmunization using the human Kell glycoprotein as an antigen to test the effect of IgG subtype on immunoregulation by antibodies to RBC alloantigens.

Thus, we performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics analyses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) before and after EP of IgG-coated RBCs. Further, metabolomics was performed on BMDMs incubated with free IgG to ensure that changes to macrophage metabolism were due to opsonized RBCs and not to free IgG binding. Uniformly labeled tracing experiments were conducted on BMDMs in the presence and absence of IgG-coated RBCs to assess the flux of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In this study, we demonstrate that EP significantly alters amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, the Krebs cycle, OXPHOS, and arachidonate-linoleate metabolism. Increases in levels of amino acids, lipids and oxylipins, heme products, and RBC-derived proteins are noted in BMDMs following EP. Tracing experiments with U-13C6 glucose indicated a slower flux through glycolysis and enhanced PPP activation. Notably, we show that it is fueled by glucose derived from the macrophages themselves or from the extracellular media prior to EP, but not from opsonized RBCs. The PPP-derived NADPH can then fuel the oxidative burst, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species necessary to promote digestion of phagocytosed RBC proteins via radical attack. Results were confirmed by redox proteomics experiments, demonstrating the oxidation of Cys152 and Cys94 of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hemoglobin-\u03b2, respectively. Significant increases in early Krebs cycle and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolites (\u03b1-ketoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate, respectively) indicate that EP promotes the dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Lastly, EP stimulated aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase and arginase activity as indicated by significant accumulations of ALA and ornithine after IgG-mediated RBC ingestion. Importantly, EP-mediated metabolic reprogramming of BMDMs does not occur following exposure to IgG alone. In conclusion, we show that EP reprograms macrophage metabolism and modifies macrophage polarization.", "Keywords": ["OXPHOS", "blood", "lipid accumulation", "macrophage metabolism", "mitochondrial dysregulation", "omics technologies", "pentose phosphate pathway"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexis", "Last Name": "Catala", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lyla A", "Last Name": "Youssef", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine - Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Marchetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine - Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Karafin", "Affiliation": "Medical Sciences Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin (Versiti), Milwaukee, WI, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32289162", "Title": "Passively transferred IgG enhances humoral immunity to a red blood cell alloantigen in mice.", "Abstract": "Antibodies are typically thought of as the endpoint of humoral immunity that occur as the result of an adaptive immune response.

In contrast, IgG has a \"dual effect\" in which it enhances responses to soluble antigens but suppresses responses to antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) (eg, immunoprophylaxis with anti-RhD). Here, we report a system in which passive antibody to an RBC antigen promotes a robust cellular immune response leading to endogenous CD4+ T-cell activation, germinal center formation, antibody secretion, and immunological memory. The mechanism requires ligation of Fc\u03b3 receptors on a specific subset of dendritic cells that results in CD4+ T-cell activation and expansion. Moreover, antibodies cross-enhance responses to a third-party antigen, but only if it is expressed on the same RBC as the antigen recognized by the antibody.

Despite the therapeutic benefits of RBC transfusions, there are associated risks. RBC-specific alloantibodies may form in response to antigenic differences between RBC donors and recipients; these alloantibodies can be a problem as they may mediate hemolysis or pose barriers to future transfusion support. While there is currently no reliable way to predict which RBC recipients will make an alloantibody response, risk factors such as inflammation have been shown to correlate with increased rates of RBC alloimmunization. The underlying mechanisms behind how inflammation mediates alloantibody production are incompletely defined. Methods: To assess erythrophagocytosis, mice were treated with PBS or inflammatory stimuli followed by a transfusion of allogeneic RBCs labeled with a lipophilic dye. At multiple time points, RBC consumption and expression of activation makers by leukocytes was evaluated. To determine which antigen presenting cell (APC) subset(s) were capable of promoting allogeneic T cell activation, sorted leukocyte populations (which had participated in erythrophagocytosis) were co-cultured in vitro with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; T cell proliferation and ability to form immunological synapses with APCs were determined. Results: Upon transfusion of fresh allogeneic RBCs, multiple APCs consumed transfused RBCs. However, only CD8+ and CD11b+ dendritic cells formed productive immunological synapses with allogeneic T cells and stimulated proliferation. Importantly, allogeneic T cell activation and RBC alloantibody production occurred in response to RBC transfusion alone, and transfusion in the context of inflammation enhanced RBC consumption, the number of immune synapses, allogeneic T cell proliferation, and the rate and magnitude of alloantibody production. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that regardless of the ability to participate in RBC consumption, only a subset of APCs are capable of forming an immune synapse with T cells thereby initiating an alloantibody response.

The relative contribution of APC subsets to RBC antibodies has not been described in either the quiescent or the inflamed states.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cytophagocytosis", "Dendritic Cells", "Erythrocytes", "Inflammation", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Monocytes", "Poly I-C", "Spleen", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda L", "Last Name": "Richards", "Affiliation": "Bloodworks NW Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Bloodworks NW Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Bloodworks NW Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."}], "Journal": "Transfusion", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "23940276", "Title": "Immune tolerance negatively regulates B cells in knock-in mice expressing broadly neutralizing HIV antibody 4E10.", "Abstract": "A major goal of HIV research is to develop vaccines reproducibly eliciting broadly neutralizing Abs (bNAbs); however, this has proved to be challenging. One suggested explanation for this difficulty is that epitopes seen by bNAbs mimic self, leading to immune tolerance. We generated knock-in mice expressing bNAb 4E10, which recognizes the membrane proximal external region of gp41. Unlike b12 knock-in mice, described in the companion article (Ota et al. 2013. J. Immunol. 191: 3179-3185), 4E10HL mice were found to undergo profound negative selection of B cells, indicating that 4E10 is, to a physiologically significant extent, autoreactive. Negative selection occurred by various mechanisms, including receptor editing, clonal deletion, and receptor downregulation. Despite significant deletion, small amounts of IgM and IgG anti-gp41 were found in the sera of 4E10HL mice. On a Rag1\u207b/\u207b background, 4E10HL mice had virtually no serum Ig of any kind. These results are consistent with a model in which B cells with 4E10 specificity are counterselected, raising the question of how 4E10 was generated in the patient from whom it was isolated. This represents the second example of a membrane proximal external region-directed bNAb that is apparently autoreactive in a physiological setting. The relative conservation in HIV of the 4E10 epitope might reflect the fact that it is under less intense immunological selection as a result of B cell self-tolerance. The safety and desirability of targeting this epitope by a vaccine is discussed in light of the newly described bNAb 10E8.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Envelope Protein gp41", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Doyle-Cooper", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Anthony B", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Ota", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Skog", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Phillip E", "Last Name": "Dawson", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Zwick", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "William R", "Last Name": "Schief", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "Dennis R", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Nemazee", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2013Sep15"}, {"PMID": "23801629", "Title": "Alloantibodies to a paternally derived RBC KEL antigen lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn in a murine model.", "Abstract": "Exposure to nonself red blood cell (RBC) antigens, either from transfusion or pregnancy, may result in alloimmunization and incompatible RBC clearance. First described as a pregnancy complication 80 years ago, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is caused by alloimmunization to paternally derived RBC antigens. Despite the morbidity/mortality of HDFN, women at risk for RBC alloimmunization have few therapeutic options. Given that alloantibodies to antigens in the KEL family are among the most clinically significant, we developed a murine model with RBC-specific expression of the human KEL antigen to evaluate the impact of maternal/fetal KEL incompatibility. After exposure to fetal KEL RBCs during successive pregnancies with KEL-positive males, 21 of 21 wild-type female mice developed anti-KEL alloantibodies; intrauterine fetal anemia and/or demise occurred in a subset of KEL-positive pups born to wild type, but not agammaglobulinemic mothers. Similar to previous observations in humans, pregnancy-associated alloantibodies were detrimental in a transfusion setting, and transfusion-associated alloantibodies were detrimental in a pregnancy setting. This is the first pregnancy-associated HDFN model described to date, which will serve as a platform to develop targeted therapies to prevent and/or mitigate the dangers of RBC alloantibodies to fetuses and newborns.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia, Hemolytic", "Animals", "Blood Transfusion", "Cytokines", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunoglobulin G", "Isoantibodies", "Kell Blood-Group System", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Animal", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Stowell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kate L", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole H", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Greg R", "Last Name": "Halverson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jaekeun C", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashley M", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn R", "Last Name": "Girard-Pierce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Maridith", "Last Name": "Arthur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Silvia T", "Last Name": "Bunting", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Aug22"}]
