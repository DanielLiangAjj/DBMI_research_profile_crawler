[{"PMID": "38758005", "Title": "Timing-dependent synergies between motor cortex and posterior spinal stimulation in humans.", "Abstract": "Volitional movement requires descending input from the motor cortex and sensory feedback through the spinal cord. We previously developed a paired brain and spinal electrical stimulation approach in rats that relies on convergence of the descending motor and spinal sensory stimuli in the cervical cord. This approach strengthened sensorimotor circuits and improved volitional movement through associative plasticity. In humans, it is not known whether posterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted at the sensorimotor interface or anterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted within the motor system is effective at facilitating brain evoked responses. In 59 individuals undergoing elective cervical spine decompression surgery, the motor cortex was stimulated with scalp electrodes and the spinal cord was stimulated with epidural electrodes, with muscle responses being recorded in arm and leg muscles. Spinal electrodes were placed either posteriorly or anteriorly, and the interval between cortex and spinal cord stimulation was varied. Pairing stimulation between the motor cortex and spinal sensory (posterior) but not spinal motor (anterior) stimulation produced motor evoked potentials that were over five times larger than brain stimulation alone. This strong augmentation occurred only when descending motor and spinal afferent stimuli were timed to converge in the spinal cord. Paired stimulation also increased the selectivity of muscle responses relative to unpaired brain or spinal cord stimulation. Finally, clinical signs suggest that facilitation was observed in both injured and uninjured segments of the spinal cord. The large effect size of this paired stimulation makes it a promising candidate for therapeutic neuromodulation. KEY POINTS: Pairs of stimuli designed to alter nervous system function typically target the motor system, or one targets the sensory system and the other targets the motor system for convergence in cortex. In humans undergoing clinically indicated surgery, we tested paired brain and spinal cord stimulation that we developed in rats aiming to target sensorimotor convergence in the cervical cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired sensorimotor stimulation were more than five times larger than brain or spinal cord stimulation alone when applied to the posterior but not anterior spinal cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired stimulation were more selective for targeted muscles than the brain- or spinal-only conditions, especially at latencies that produced the strongest effects of paired stimulation. Measures of clinical evidence of compression were only weakly related to the paired stimulation effect, suggesting that it could be applied as therapy in people affected by disorders of the central nervous system.", "Keywords": ["cervical", "electrical stimulation", "epidural", "motor cortex", "motor evoked potentials", "myelopathy", "spinal cord"], "MeSH terms": ["Motor Cortex", "Humans", "Male", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Spinal Cord", "Adult", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Spinal Cord Stimulation", "Aged", "Electric Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "McIntosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evan F", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phoebe", "Last Name": "Greenwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra C", "Last Name": "Dionne", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynda M", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Earl", "Last Name": "Thuet", "Affiliation": "New York Presbyterian, The Och Spine Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oleg", "Last Name": "Modik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evgeny", "Last Name": "Shelkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Lombardi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeeshan M", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew K", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Noam Y", "Last Name": "Harel", "Affiliation": "Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Virk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mandigo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason B", "Last Name": "Carmel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38368486", "Title": "Transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation improves sensory performance in humans: a randomized controlled crossover pilot study.", "Abstract": "Accurate senses depend on high-fidelity encoding by sensory receptors and error-free processing in the brain.

We sought to map muscle responses to posterior epidural cervical spinal cord stimulation in humans. We hypothesized that lateral stimulation over the dorsal root entry zone would be most effective and responses would be strongest in the muscles innervated by the stimulated segment. Twenty-six people undergoing clinically indicated cervical spine surgery consented to mapping of motor responses. During surgery, stimulation was performed in midline and lateral positions at multiple exposed segments; six arm and three leg muscles were recorded on each side of the body. Across all segments and muscles tested, lateral stimulation produced stronger muscle responses than midline despite similar latency and shape of responses. Muscles innervated at a cervical segment had the largest responses from stimulation at that segment, but responses were also observed in muscles innervated at other cervical segments and in leg muscles. The cervical responses were clustered in rostral (C4-C6) and caudal (C7-T1) cervical segments. Strong responses to lateral stimulation are likely due to the proximity of stimulation to afferent axons. Small changes in response sizes to stimulation of adjacent cervical segments argue for local circuit integration, and distant muscle responses suggest activation of long propriospinal connections. This map can help guide cervical stimulation to improve arm and hand function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A map of muscle responses to cervical epidural stimulation during clinically indicated surgery revealed strongest activation when stimulating laterally compared to midline and revealed differences to be weaker than expected across different segments. In contrast, waveform shapes and latencies were most similar when stimulating midline and laterally, indicating activation of overlapping circuitry. Thus, a map of the cervical spinal cord reveals organization and may help guide stimulation to activate arm and hand muscles strongly and selectively.", "Keywords": ["cervical spinal cord injury", "electrical stimulation", "epidural", "motor evoked potentials", "myelopathy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Electromyography", "Spinal Cord", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Forelimb", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Electric Stimulation", "Spinal Cord Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "McIntosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Evan F", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jacob L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lynda M", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bushra", "Last Name": "Yasin", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anil", "Last Name": "Mendiratta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Steven C", "Last Name": "Karceski", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Earl", "Last Name": "Thuet", "Affiliation": "New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Oleg", "Last Name": "Modik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Evgeny", "Last Name": "Shelkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Lombardi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zeeshan M", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mandigo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Noam Y", "Last Name": "Harel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Virk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian, Och Spine Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jason B", "Last Name": "Carmel", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, https://ror.org/00hj8s172Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2023Jan01"}, {"PMID": "36063483", "Title": "Spinal cord associative plasticity improves forelimb sensorimotor function after cervical injury.", "Abstract": "Associative plasticity occurs when two stimuli converge on a common neural target. Previous efforts to promote associative plasticity have targeted cortex, with variable and moderate effects. In addition, the targeted circuits are inferred, rather than tested directly. In contrast, we sought to target the strong convergence between motor and sensory systems in the spinal cord. We developed spinal cord associative plasticity, precisely timed pairing of motor cortex and dorsal spinal cord stimulations, to target this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that properly timed paired stimulation would strengthen the sensorimotor connections in the spinal cord and improve recovery after spinal cord injury. We tested physiological effects of paired stimulation, the pathways that mediate it, and its function in a preclinical trial. Subthreshold spinal cord stimulation strongly augmented motor cortex evoked muscle potentials at the time they were paired, but only when they arrived synchronously in the spinal cord. This paired stimulation effect depended on both cortical descending motor and spinal cord proprioceptive afferents; selective inactivation of either of these pathways fully abrogated the paired stimulation effect. Spinal cord associative plasticity, repetitive pairing of these pathways for 5 or 30\u2005min in awake rats, increased spinal excitability for hours after pairing ended. To apply spinal cord associative plasticity as therapy, we optimized the parameters to promote strong and long-lasting effects. This effect was just as strong in rats with cervical spinal cord injury as in uninjured rats, demonstrating that spared connections after moderate spinal cord injury were sufficient to support plasticity. In a blinded trial, rats received a moderate C4 contusive spinal cord injury. Ten days after injury, they were randomized to 30\u2005min of spinal cord associative plasticity each day for 10 days or sham stimulation. Rats with spinal cord associative plasticity had significantly improved function on the primary outcome measure, a test of dexterity during manipulation of food, at 50 days after spinal cord injury. In addition, rats with spinal cord associative plasticity had persistently stronger responses to cortical and spinal stimulation than sham stimulation rats, indicating a spinal locus of plasticity. After spinal cord associative plasticity, rats had near normalization of H-reflex modulation. The groups had no difference in the rat grimace scale, a measure of pain. We conclude that spinal cord associative plasticity strengthens sensorimotor connections within the spinal cord, resulting in partial recovery of reflex modulation and forelimb function after moderate spinal cord injury.

Recent work has begun to tease apart how neuromodulatory systems influence sensory processing. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is well-known as an effective and safe method of activating neuromodulatory systems. There is a growing body of studies confirming VNS has immediate effects on sensory processing across multiple sensory modalities. These immediate effects of VNS on sensory processing are distinct from the more well-documented method of inducing lasting neuroplastic changes to the sensory pathways through repeatedly delivering a brief VNS burst paired with a sensory stimulus. Immediate effects occur upon VNS onset, often disappear upon VNS offset, and the modulation is present for all sensory stimuli. Conversely, the neuroplastic effect of pairing sub-second bursts of VNS with a sensory stimulus alters sensory processing only after multiple pairing sessions, this alteration remains after cessation of pairing sessions, and the alteration selectively affects the response properties of neurons encoding the specific paired sensory stimulus. Here, we call attention to the immediate effects VNS has on sensory processing.

We are interested in pairing cervical TSCS with other forms of nervous system stimulation to enhance synaptic plasticity in circuits serving hand function. We use a novel configuration for cervical TSCS in which the anode is placed anteriorly over ~C4-C5 and the cathode posteriorly over ~T2-T4. We measured the effects of single pulses of TSCS paired with single pulses of motor cortex or median nerve stimulation timed to arrive at the cervical spinal cord at varying intervals. In 13 participants with and 15 participants without chronic cervical spinal cord injury, we observed that subthreshold TSCS facilitates hand muscle responses to motor cortex stimulation, with a tendency toward greater facilitation when TSCS is timed to arrive at cervical synapses simultaneously or up to 10 milliseconds after cortical stimulus arrival. Single pulses of subthreshold TSCS had no effect on the amplitudes of median H-reflex responses or F-wave responses. These findings support a model in which TSCS paired with appropriately timed cortical stimulation has the potential to facilitate convergent transmission between descending motor circuits, segmental afferents, and spinal motor neurons serving the hand.

METHOD Patients were part of a convenience and physician-referred cohort recruited from a single medical center, and research whole-exome sequencing was completed. Participants were evaluated for the following risk factors: extreme preterm birth, brain bleed or stroke, birth asphyxia, brain malformations, and intrauterine infection. RESULTS A total of 151 unrelated individuals with CP (81 females, 70 males; mean age 25y 7mo [SD 17y 5mo], range 3wks-72y) participated. Causative genetic variants were identified in 14 participants (9.3%). There was no significant difference in diagnostic rate between individuals with risk factors (10 out of 123; 8.1%) and those without (4 out of 28; 14.3%) (Fisher's exact p=0.3). INTERPRETATION While the rate of genetic diagnoses among individuals without risk factors was higher than those with risk factors, the difference was not statistically significant at this sample size. The identification of genetic diagnoses in over 8% of cases with risk factors suggests that these might confer susceptibility to environmental factors, and that further research should include individuals with risk factors. What this paper adds There is no significant difference in diagnostic rate between individuals with and without risk factors. Genetic variants may confer susceptibility to environmental risk factors. Six causative variants were identified in genes not previously associated with cerebral palsy. Global developmental delay/intellectual disability is positively associated with a genetic etiology.

Two types of UE training have been particularly successful: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) and Bimanual training. Reorganization of the corticospinal tract (CST) early during development often occurs in USCP. Prior studies have suggested that children with an ipsilateral CST controlling the affected UE may improve less following CIMT than children with a contralateral CST. We tested the hypothesis that improvements in UE function after intensive training depend on CST laterality. Study Participants and Setting: Eighty-two children with USCP, age 5 years 10 months to 17 years, University laboratory setting. Materials/Methods: Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to determine each child's CST connectivity pattern. Children were stratified by age, sex, baseline hand function and CST connectivity pattern, and randomized to receive either CIMT or Bimanual training, each of which were provided in a day-camp setting (90 h). Hand function was tested before, immediately and 6 months after the intervention with the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function, the Assisting Hand Assessment, the Box and Block Test, and ABILHAND-Kids. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was used to track goal achievement and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory was used to assess functioning in daily living activities at home. Results: In contrast to our hypothesis, participants had statistically similar improvements for both CIMT and Bimanual training for all measures independent of their CST connectivity pattern (contralateral, ipsilateral, or bilateral) (p < 0.05 in all cases). Conclusions/Significance: The efficacy of CIMT and Bimanual training is independent of CST connectivity pattern. Children with an ipsilateral CST, previously thought to be maladaptive, have the capacity to improve as well as children with a contralateral or bilateral CST following intensive CIMT or Bimanual training.

Variability in hand function among children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) might reflect the type of brain injury and resulting anatomical sequelae. Objective. We used atlas-based analysis of structural images to determine whether children with periventricular (PV) versus middle cerebral artery (MCA) injuries might exhibit unique anatomical characteristics that account for differences in hand function. Methods. Forty children with UCP underwent structural brain imaging using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. Brain lesions were classified as PV or MCA. A group of 40 typically developing (TD) children served as comparison controls. Whole brains were parcellated into 198 structures (regions of interest) to obtain volume estimates. Dexterity and bimanual hand function were assessed. Unbiased, differential expression analysis was performed to determine volumetric differences between PV and MCA groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and the top 3 components were extracted to perform regression on hand function. Results. Children with PV had significantly better hand function than children with MCA. Multidimensional scaling analysis of volumetric data revealed separate clustering of children with MCA, PV, and TD children. PCA extracted anatomical components that comprised the 2 types of brain injury. In the MCA group, reductions of volume were concentrated in sensorimotor structures of the injured hemisphere. Models using PCA predicted hand function with greater accuracy than models based on qualitative brain injury type. Conclusions. Our results highlight unique quantitative differences in children with UCP that also predict differences in hand function.

For the lesion, we used an optrode, which contains an electrode to localize forelimb responses and an optical fiber to deliver light. The infarct was induced when light activated the photothrombotic agent Rose Bengal, which was administered systemically. Results- We found largely a separate distribution of the forelimb and hindlimb axons in the IC, both by microstimulation mapping and tract tracing.

Rats with paired cortical and spinal stimulation achieved significantly better forelimb motor function recovery, as measured by fewer stepping errors on the horizontal ladder task (34\u202f\u00b1\u202f9% in stimulation group vs. 51\u202f\u00b1\u202f18% in control, p\u202f=\u202f.013) and higher scores on the food manipulation task (IBB, 0-9 score; 7.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8 in stimulated rats vs. 5.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.6 in controls, p\u202f=\u202f.025). The effect size for both tasks was large (Cohen's d\u202f=\u202f1.0 and 0.92, respectively). The CST axon length in the cervical spinal cord did not differ significantly between the groups, but there was denser and broader ipsilateral axons distribution distal to the spinal cord injury. The large behavioral effect and replication in an independent laboratory validate this approach, which will be trialed in cats before being tested in people using non-invasive methods.", "Keywords": ["Corticospinal", "Direct current stimulation", "Electrical stimulation", "Motor cortex", "Motor recovery", "Spinal cord", "Spinal cord injury", "Transcutaneous", "iTBS"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cervical Cord", "Double-Blind Method", "Electric Stimulation", "Forelimb", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Rats", "Recovery of Function", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Orthopedics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aditya", "Last Name": "Ramamurthy", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Orthopedics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophia", "Last Name": "Lall", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shivakeshavan", "Last Name": "Ratnadurai-Giridharan", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Madeleine", "Last Name": "Lopane", "Affiliation": "Burke Neurological Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neela", "Last Name": "Zareen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences, City University of NY School of Medicine, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Alexander", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences, City University of NY School of Medicine, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences, City University of NY School of Medicine, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "John H", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences, City University of NY School of Medicine, New York, NY 10031, USA; CUNY Graduate Center, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason B", "Last Name": "Carmel", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Orthopedics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10031, USA.

Often, this is performed by stimulating motor cortex and recording muscle activity with electromyography; the evoked response is called the motor evoked potential (MEP). To understand system dynamics, MEPs are typically recorded through a range of motor cortex stimulation intensities. The MEPs increase with increasing stimulation intensities, and these typically produce a sigmoidal response curve. Analysis of MEPs is often complex and analysis of response curves is time-consuming. We created an MEP analysis software, called Motometrics, to facilitate analysis of MEPs and response curves. The goal is to combine robust signal processing algorithms with a simple user interface. Motometrics first enables the user to annotate data files acquired from the recording system so that the responses can be extracted and labeled with the correct subject and experimental condition. The software enables quick visual representations of entire datasets, to ensure uniform quality of the signal. It then enables the user to choose a variety of response curve analyses and to perform near real time quantification of the MEPs for quick feedback during experimental procedures. This is a modular open source tool that is compatible with several popular electrophysiological systems. Initial use indicates that Motometrics enables rapid, robust, and intuitive analysis of MEP response curves by neuroscientists without programming or signal processing expertise.", "Keywords": ["EMG", "MEP", "analysis", "evoked", "motor", "recruitment", "software"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shivakeshavan", "Last Name": "Ratnadurai Giridharan", "Affiliation": "Motor Recovery Lab, Burke Neurological Institute, White Plains, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Disha", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Pal", "Affiliation": "Motor Recovery Lab, Burke Neurological Institute, White Plains, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Asht M", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Motor Recovery Lab, Burke Neurological Institute, White Plains, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "N Jeremy", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Motor Recovery Lab, Burke Neurological Institute, White Plains, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jason B", "Last Name": "Carmel", "Affiliation": "Motor Recovery Lab, Burke Neurological Institute, White Plains, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroinformatics", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30452585", "Title": "Curveball: A tool for rapid measurement of contrast sensitivity based on smooth eye movements.", "Abstract": "The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is an informative measure of visual function, but current tools for assessing it are limited by the attentional, motor, and communicative abilities of the participant.

Some studies suggest the uninjured hemisphere controls the impaired forelimb, while others suggest that the injured hemisphere does; these pathways have never been compared directly. We tested the contribution of each motor cortex to the recovery forelimb function after neonatal injury of the CST. We cut the left pyramid (pyramidotomy) of postnatal day 7 rats, which caused a measurable impairment of the right forelimb. We used pharmacological inactivation of each motor cortex to test its contribution to a skilled reach and supination task. Rats with neonatal pyramidotomy were further impaired by inactivation of motor cortex in both the injured and the uninjured hemispheres, while the forelimb of uninjured rats was impaired only from the contralateral motor cortex. Thus, inactivation demonstrated motor control from each motor cortex. In contrast, physiological and anatomical interrogation of these pathways support adaptations only in the uninjured hemisphere. Intracortical microstimulation of motor cortex in the uninjured hemisphere of rats with neonatal pyramidotomy produced responses from both forelimbs, while stimulation of the injured hemisphere did not elicit responses from either forelimb. Both anterograde and retrograde tracers were used to label corticofugal pathways. There was no increased plasticity from the injured hemisphere, either from cortex to the red nucleus or the red nucleus to the spinal cord. In contrast, there were very strong CST connections to both halves of the spinal cord from the uninjured motor cortex. Retrograde tracing produced maps of each forelimb within the uninjured hemisphere, and these were partly segregated.

While these tasks are easy to implement and are robust across disease models, they are subjective and laborious for the experimenter. Automating traditional tasks or creating new automated tasks can make the tasks more efficient, objective, and quantitative. Since rats are less dexterous than primates, central nervous system (CNS) injury produces more subtle deficits in dexterity, however, supination is highly affected in rodents and crucial to hand function in primates. Therefore, we designed a semi-automated task that measures forelimb supination in rats. Rats are trained to reach and grasp a knob-shaped manipulandum and turn the manipulandum in supination to receive a reward. Rats can acquire the skill within 20 \u00b1 5 days. While the early part of training is highly supervised, much of the training is done without direct supervision. The task reliably and reproducibly captures subtle deficits after injury and shows functional recovery that accurately reflects clinical recovery curves. Analysis of data is performed by specialized software through a graphical user interface that is designed to be intuitive. We also give solutions to common problems encountered during training, and show that minor corrections to behavior early in training produce reliable acquisition of supination.

The second uses the spatial connectivity of a circuit to achieve specificity: one genetic element is introduced at the origin of a circuit and the other at its termination. When the two genetic elements combine within a neuron, they can alter its function. These two general approaches can be combined to allow manipulation of neurons with a specific genetic identity by introducing a regulatory gene into the origin or termination of the circuit. We consider the advantages and disadvantages of both these general approaches with regard to specificity and efficacy of the manipulations. We also review the genetic techniques that allow gain- and loss-of-function within specific neural circuits. These approaches introduce light-sensitive channels (optogenetic) or drug sensitive channels (chemogenetic) into neurons that form specific circuits.

We compared the effects of structured bimanual skill training versus unstructured bimanual practice on motor outcomes and motor map plasticity in children with USCP.

Methods Twenty children with USCP (average age 9.5; 12 males) received therapy in a day camp setting, 6 h/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. In structured skill training (n = 10), children performed progressively more difficult movements and practiced functional goals. In unstructured practice (n = 10), children engaged in bimanual activities but did not practice skillful movements or functional goals. We used the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to measure hand function. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to map the representation of first dorsal interosseous and flexor carpi radialis muscles bilaterally. Results Both groups showed significant improvements in bimanual hand use (AHA; P < .05) and hand dexterity (JTTHF; P < .001). However, only the structured skill group showed increases in the size of the affected hand motor map and amplitudes of motor evoked potentials (P < .01).

All three inhibitors can interact with either the Nogo receptor complex or paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B. A conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve allows the central processes of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to spontaneously regenerate in vivo after a dorsal column lesion. After a conditioning lesion, DRG neurons are no longer inhibited by myelin, and this effect is cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and transcription-dependent. Using a microarray analysis, we identified several genes that are up-regulated both in adult DRGs after a conditioning lesion and in DRG neurons treated with cAMP analogues. One gene that was up-regulated under both conditions is metallothionein (MT)-I. We show here that treatment with two closely related isoforms of MT (MT-I/II) can overcome the inhibitory effects of both myelin and MAG for cortical, hippocampal, and DRG neurons. Intrathecal delivery of MT-I/II to adult DRGs also promotes neurite outgrowth in the presence of MAG. Adult DRGs from MT-I/II-deficient mice extend significantly shorter processes on MAG compared with wild-type DRG neurons, and regeneration of dorsal column axons does not occur after a conditioning lesion in MT-I/II-deficient mice. Furthermore, a single intravitreal injection of MT-I/II after optic nerve crush promotes axonal regeneration.

Our approach to CST repair after injury in mature animals was informed by our finding that activity drives establishment of connections with spinal cord circuits during postnatal development. After incomplete injury in maturity, spared CST circuits sprout, and partially restore lost function. Our approach harnesses activity to augment this injury-dependent CST sprouting and to promote function. Lesion of the medullary pyramid unilaterally eliminates all CST axons from one hemisphere and allows examination of CST sprouting from the unaffected hemisphere. We discovered that 10 days of electrical stimulation of either the spared CST or motor cortex induces CST axon sprouting that partially reconstructs the lost CST. Stimulation also leads to sprouting of the cortical projection to the magnocellular red nucleus, where the rubrospinal tract originates. Coordinated outgrowth of the CST and cortical projections to the red nucleus could support partial re-establishment of motor systems connections to the denervated spinal motor circuits. Stimulation restores skilled motor function in our animal model. Lesioned animals have a persistent forelimb deficit contralateral to pyramidotomy in the horizontal ladder task. Rats that received motor cortex stimulation either after acute or chronic injury showed a significant functional improvement that brought error rate to pre-lesion control levels. Reversible inactivation of the stimulated motor cortex reinstated the impairment demonstrating the importance of the stimulated system to recovery. Motor cortex electrical stimulation is an effective approach to promote spouting of spared CST axons.

This study examines the association between an estimate of CST dysgenesis and (1) hand function and (2) the efficacy of intensive bimanual training in improving hand function. Children with unilateral CP, age 3.6-14.9 years, n = 35, received intensive bimanual training. Children engaged in bimanual functional/play activities (6 h/day, 15 days). Peduncle asymmetry, an estimate of CST dysgenesis, was measured on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. Hand function was measured pre- and post-treatment using the assisting hand assessment (AHA) and Jebsen-Taylor test of hand function (JTTHF). AHA and JTTHF improved post-treatment (p < 0.001). Peduncle asymmetry was correlated with baseline AHA and JTTHF (p < 0.001) but not with AHA or JTTHF improvement post-training (R(2) < 0.1, p > 0.2).

One exception is the polymorphism in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a critical neurotrophin for brain repair and plasticity. Humans have a high-frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the prodomain of the BDNF gene. Previous studies show that the BDNF Val66Met variant negatively affects motor learning and severity of acute stroke. To investigate the impact of this common BDNF SNP on stroke recovery, we used a mouse model that contains the human BDNF Val66Met variant in both alleles (BDNF(M/M)). Male BDNF(+/+) and BDNF(M/M) littermates received sham or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. We assessed motor function regularly for 6 months after stroke and then performed anatomical analyses. Despite reported negative association of the SNP with motor learning and acute deficits, we unexpectedly found that BDNF(M/M) mice displayed significantly enhanced motor/kinematic performance in the chronic phase of motor recovery, especially in ipsilesional hindlimb. The enhanced recovery was associated with significant increases in striatum volume, dendritic arbor, and elevated excitatory synaptic markers in the contralesional striatum. Transient inactivation of the contralateral striatum during recovery transiently abolished the enhanced function. This study showed an unexpected benefit of the BDNFVal66Met carriers for functional recovery, involving structural and molecular plasticity in the nonstroked hemisphere.

Electrical stimulation of motor cortex augments sprouting of intact CST axons and promotes functional recovery when applied soon after injury. We hypothesized that electrical stimulation of motor cortex in the intact hemisphere after chronic lesion of the CST in the other hemisphere would restore function through ipsilateral control. To test motor skill, rats were trained and tested to walk on a horizontal ladder with irregularly spaced rungs. Eight weeks after injury, produced by pyramidal tract transection, half of the rats received forelimb motor cortex stimulation of the intact hemisphere. Rats with injury and stimulation had significantly improved forelimb control compared with rats with injury alone and achieved a level of proficiency similar to uninjured rats. To test whether recovery of forelimb function was attributable to ipsilateral control, we selectively inactivated the stimulated motor cortex using the GABA agonist muscimol. The dose of muscimol we used produces strong contralateral but no ipsilateral impairments in naive rats. In rats with injury and stimulation, but not those with injury alone, inactivation caused worsening of forelimb function; the initial deficit was reinstated. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation can promote recovery of motor function when applied late after injury and that motor control can be exerted from the ipsilateral motor cortex.

We also show that SLPI can overcome inhibition by CNS myelin and significantly enhance regeneration of transected retinal ganglion cell axons in rats. Furthermore, regeneration of dorsal column axons does not occur after a conditioning lesion in SLPI null mutant mice, indicating that expression of SLPI is required for the conditioning lesion effect. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SLPI localizes to the nuclei of neurons, binds to the Smad2 promoter, and reduces levels of Smad2 protein.

Here, we tested: (i) if M1 stimulation only increases spinal axon length or if it also promotes connections to brain stem forelimb control centers, especially magnocellular red nucleus; and (ii) if stimulation-induced increase in axon length depends on whether pyramidotomy denervated the structure. After unilateral pyramidotomy, we electrically stimulated the forelimb area of intact M1, to activate the intact CST and other corticofugal pathways, for 10 days. We anterogradely labeled stimulated M1 and measured axon length using stereology. Stimulation increased axon length in both the spinal cord and magnocellular red nucleus, even though the spinal cord is denervated by pyramidotomy and the red nucleus is not. Stimulation also promoted outgrowth in the cuneate and parvocellular red nuclei. In the spinal cord, electrical stimulation caused increased axon length ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to stimulation. Thus, stimulation promoted outgrowth preferentially to the sparsely corticospinal-innervated and impaired side. Outgrowth resulted in greater axon density in the ipsilateral dorsal horn and intermediate zone, resembling the contralateral termination pattern. Importantly, as in spinal cord, increase in axon length in brain stem also was preferentially directed towards areas less densely innervated by the stimulated system. Thus, M1 electrical stimulation promotes increases in corticofugal axon length to multiple M1 targets.
