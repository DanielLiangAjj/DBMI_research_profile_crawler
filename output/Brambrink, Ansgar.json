In the developing brain they can cause neuronal and oligodendroglia apoptosis, impair synaptogenesis, inhibit neurogenesis and trigger long-term neurocognitive sequelae. In humans, the vulnerable period is projected to extend from the third trimester of pregnancy to the third year of life. Infants with seizures and epilepsies may receive barbiturates, benzodiazepines and their combinations for days, months or years. How exposure duration affects neuropathological sequelae is unknown. Here we investigated toxicity of phenobarbital/midazolam (Pb/M) combination in the developing nonhuman primate brain. Neonatal rhesus monkeys received phenobarbital intravenously, followed by infusion of midazolam over 5 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) or 24\u00a0h (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Animals were euthanized at 8 or 36\u00a0h and brains examined immunohistochemically and stereologically. Treatment was well tolerated, physiological parameters remained at optimal levels. Compared to na\u00efve controls, Pb/M exposed brains displayed widespread apoptosis affecting neurons and oligodendrocytes. Pattern and severity of cell death differed depending on treatment-duration, with more extensive neurodegeneration following longer exposure. At 36\u00a0h, areas of the brain not affected at 8\u00a0h displayed neuronal apoptosis, while oligodendroglia death was most prominent at 8\u00a0h. A notable feature at 36\u00a0h was degeneration of neuronal tracts and trans-neuronal death of neurons, presumably following their disconnection from degenerated presynaptic partners. These findings demonstrate that brain toxicity of Pb/M in the neonatal primate brain becomes more severe with longer exposures and expands trans-synaptically. Impact of these sequelae on neurocognitive outcomes and the brain connectome will need to be explored.", "Keywords": ["Anticonvulsant", "Antiepileptic", "Apoptosis", "Barbiturate", "Benzodiazepine", "Brain injury", "Development", "Sedative"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Anticonvulsants", "Brain", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Macaca mulatta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kevin K", "Last Name": "Noguchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, School of Medicine, St Louis, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Fuhler", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, School of Medicine, St Louis, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophie H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, School of Medicine, St Louis, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saverio", "Last Name": "Capuano", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin R", "Last Name": "Brunner", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shreya", "Last Name": "Larson", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Crosno", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heather A", "Last Name": "Simmons", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andres F", "Last Name": "Mejia", "Affiliation": "Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren D", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, OR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Dissen", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, OR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ansgar", "Last Name": "Brambrink", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chrysanthy", "Last Name": "Ikonomidou", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine, Madison, WI, USA.

They cause apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes, impair synaptic plasticity, inhibit neurogenesis and trigger long-term neurocognitive deficits. The projected vulnerable period in humans extends from the third trimester of pregnancy to the third year of life. Despite all concerns, there is no ethically and medically acceptable alternative to the use of sedatives and anesthetics for surgeries and painful interventions. Development of measures that prevent injury while allowing the medications to exert their desired actions has enormous translational value. Here we investigated protective potential of hypothermia against histological toxicity of the anesthetic sevoflurane in the developing nonhuman primate brain. Neonatal rhesus monkeys underwent sevoflurane anesthesia over 5\u202fh. Body temperature was regulated in the normothermic (>36.5\u202f\u00b0C), mild hypothermic (35-36.5\u202f\u00b0C) and moderately hypothermic (<35\u202f\u00b0C) range. Animals were euthanized at 8\u202fh and brains examined immunohistochemically (activated caspase 3) and stereologically to quantify apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Sevoflurane anesthesia was well tolerated at all temperatures, with oxygen saturations, end tidal CO2 and blood gases remaining at optimal levels. Compared to controls, sevoflurane exposed brains displayed significant apoptosis in gray and white matter affecting neurons and oligodendrocytes. Mild hypothermia (35-36.5\u202f\u00b0C) conferred significant protection from apoptotic brain injury, whereas moderate hypothermia (<35\u202f\u00b0C) did not. Hypothermia ameliorates anesthesia-induced apoptosis in the neonatal primate brain within a narrow temperature window (35-36.5\u202f\u00b0C). Protection is lost at temperatures below 35\u202f\u00b0C.

We evaluated whether apoptosis, triggered by the anesthetic sevoflurane in the brains of neonatal rhesus macaques, can be detected using quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Neonatal (n\u202f=\u202f15) rhesus macaques underwent 5\u202fh of sevoflurane anesthesia. QUS images were obtained through the sagittal suture at 0.5 and 6\u202fh.

Significant apoptosis was detected in white and gray matter throughout the brain, including the thalamus. We measured a change in the effective scatterer size (ESS), a QUS biomarker derived from ultrasound echo signals obtained with clinical scanners, after sevoflurane-anesthesia in the thalamus. Although initial inclusion of all measurements did not reveal a significant correlation, when outliers were excluded, the change in the ESS between the pre- and post-anesthesia measurements correlated strongly and proportionally with the severity of apoptotic death. We report for the first time in vivo changes in QUS parameters, which may reflect severity of apoptosis in the brains of infant nonhuman primates.

Opinion, however, remains divided over how cumulative evidence from preclinical and human studies in this field should be interpreted and its translation to current practices in pediatric anesthesia and surgery. A group of international experts in laboratory and clinical sciences recently convened in Genoa, Italy, to evaluate the current state of both laboratory and clinical research and discuss future directions for basic, translational, and clinical studies in this field. This paper describes those discussions and conclusions. A central goal identified was the importance of continuing to pursue laboratory research efforts to better understand the biological pathways underlying anesthesia neurotoxicity. The distinction between basic and translational experimental designs in this field was highlighted, and it was acknowledged that it will be important for future animal research to try to causally link structural changes with long-term cognitive abnormalities. While inherent limitations will continue to affect the ability of even large observational cohorts to determine if anesthesia impacts neurodevelopment or behavioral outcomes, the importance of conducting further large well-designed cohort studies was also emphasized. Adequately powered cohorts could clarify which populations are at increased risk, provide information on environmental and healthcare-related risk modifiers, and guide future interventional trials. If anesthetics cause structural or functional adverse neurological effects in young children, alternative or mitigating strategies need to be considered. While protective or mitigating strategies have been repeatedly studied in animals, there are currently no human data to support alternative anesthetic strategies in clinical practice. Lastly, it was noted that there is still considerable debate over the clinical relevance of anesthesia neurotoxicity, and the need to evaluate the impact of other aspects of perioperative care on neurodevelopment must also be considered.", "Keywords": ["anesthesia", "clinical trial", "neurodevelopment", "neurotoxicity", "pediatrics", "research"], "MeSH terms": ["Anesthesia", "Anesthetics", "Animals", "Brain", "Child", "Child Development", "Humans", "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicola", "Last Name": "Disma", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "O'Leary", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Andreas W", "Last Name": "Loepke", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac Anesthesiology, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ansgar M", "Last Name": "Brambrink", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Karin", "Last Name": "Becke", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Cnopf Children's Hospital, N\u00fcrnberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicola G", "Last Name": "Clausen", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Jurgen C", "Last Name": "De Graaff", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research/Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson, Arkansas."}, {"First Name": "Tom G", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia & Intensive Care, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "McCann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Perioperative Pain and Critical Care Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia F", "Last Name": "Salorio", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychology, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Sulpicio", "Last Name": "Soriano", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Perioperative Pain and Critical Care Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Lena S", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Anesthesia, Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Szmuk", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern and Children's Health Medical Centre, Dallas, Texas."}, {"First Name": "David O", "Last Name": "Warner", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Laszlo", "Last Name": "Vutskits", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Intensive Care, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}], "Journal": "Paediatric anaesthesia", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "29593226", "Title": "Caffeine Augments Anesthesia Neurotoxicity in the Fetal Macaque Brain.", "Abstract": "Caffeine is the most frequently used medication in premature infants.

In comparison, in our previous studies on P6 rhesus macaques, approximately 52% of the dying cells were glia and 48% were neurons.

These findings pose a potentially serious dilemma because millions of human infants are exposed to anaesthetic drugs every year as part of routine medical care. Lithium (Li) at clinically established doses is neuroprotective in various cerebral injury models. We therefore investigated whether Li also protects against anaesthesia neurotoxicity in infant NHPs. On postnatal day 6 NHPs were anaesthetized with the widely used anaesthetic isoflurane (ISO) for 5 h employing the same standards as in a human pediatric surgery setting. Co-administration of Li completely prevented the acute ISO-induced neuroapoptosis and significantly reduced ISO-induced apoptosis of oligodendroglia. Our findings are highly encouraging as they suggest that a relatively simple pharmacological manipulation might protect the developing primate brain against the neurotoxic action of anaesthetic drugs while not interfering with the beneficial actions of these drugs.

Venous blood samples were collected to determine blood gases and metabolic status at baseline, 0.5, 2.5, and 4.5 h after induction and at 3 h after the end of anesthesia. Compared with ketamine, isoflurane caused more hypotensive events and necessitated the administration of increased volumes of intravenous fluids to support blood pressure throughout anesthesia; no significant differences were observed between the isoflurane and propofol groups for these parameters. In addition, isoflurane resulted in a significantly shorter average time to extubation, compared with both ketamine and propofol. Due to supportive care, other physiologic variables remained stable between anesthetic regimens and throughout the 5-h exposure.

Since neurogenesis has recently been recognized as contributing to stroke outcomes, we investigated the role of androgens on stroke-induced neurogenesis. Adult male mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and neurogenesis was examined 1 week later by quantifying BrdU/doublecortin-positive and BrdU/NeuN-positive neurons in brain germinal regions as well as the injured striatum. To elucidate the role of endogenous androgens, post-MCAO neurogenesis was examined in gonadally intact males, intact males implanted with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide, and surgically castrated males. Surgical castration or pharmacologic androgen receptor blockade had no effects on post-ischemic neurogenesis, except that continuous androgen receptor blockade unexpectedly suppressed maturation of newborn neurons (BrdU/NeuN-positive cells) in the dentate gyrus. Post-MCAO neurogenesis was also examined in surgically castrated mice treated with continuous release implants containing testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone and DHT robustly inhibited post-ischemic neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and the more potent androgen DHT virtually abolished the presence of immature newborn neurons (BrdU/doublecortin-positive cells) in the injured striatum. Our data suggest that endogenous androgens do not alter post-stroke neurogenesis quantitatively, but the presence of supra-physiological androgen stimulation profoundly suppresses early neurogenesis in germinal brain areas and reduces cellular repair in injured tissue after cerebral ischemia.
