[{"PMID": "38143537", "Title": "Advancing early relational health: a collaborative exploration of a research agenda.", "Abstract": "Here, we introduce the Early Relational Health (ERH) Learning Community's bold, large-scale, collaborative, data-driven and practice-informed research agenda focused on furthering our mechanistic understanding of ERH and identifying feasible and effective practices for making ERH promotion a routine and integrated component of pediatric primary care. The ERH Learning Community, formed by a team of parent/caregiver leaders, pediatric care clinicians, researchers, and early childhood development specialists, is a workgroup of Nurture Connection-a hub geared toward promoting ERH, i.e., the positive and nurturing relationship between young children and their parent(s)/caregiver(s), in families and communities nationwide. In response to the current child mental health crisis and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement promoting ERH, the ERH Learning Community held an in-person meeting at the AAP national headquarters in December 2022 where members collaboratively designed an integrated research agenda to advance ERH. This agenda weaves together community partners, clinicians, and academics, melding the principles of participatory engagement and human-centered design, such as early engagement, co-design, iterative feedback, and cultural humility. Here, we present gaps in the ERH literature that prompted this initiative and the co-design activity that led to this novel and iterative community-focused research agenda, with parents/caregivers at the core, and in close collaboration with pediatric clinicians for real-world promotion of ERH in the pediatric primary care setting.", "Keywords": ["caregivers", "centrality of relationships", "connection", "early relational health", "nurture", "parent-child interactions", "parents", "pediatrics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9ane", "Last Name": "Lavall\u00e9e", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jessica L", "Last Name": "Riggs", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia A", "Last Name": "Frosch", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Development and Family Science, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tyson V", "Last Name": "Barker", "Affiliation": "Science and Innovation Strategy, Institute for Child Success, Greenville, SC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Debra L", "Last Name": "Best", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brenda", "Last Name": "Blasingame", "Affiliation": "Vav Amani Consulting LLC, El Cerrito, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Bushar", "Affiliation": "HealthySteps, ZERO TO THREE, Washington, DC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dominique", "Last Name": "Charlot-Swilley", "Affiliation": "Center for Child and Human Development, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Erickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Morgan A", "Last Name": "Finkel", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bryn", "Last Name": "Fortune", "Affiliation": "Fortune Consulting, Early Relational Health-Family Network Collaborative, Royal Oak, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Leah", "Last Name": "Gillen", "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Innovation, Reach out and Read, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marty", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Chief Executive Officer, Reach Out and Read, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Usha", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lee M", "Last Name": "Sanders", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Willis", "Affiliation": "Center for the Study of Social Policy, Washington, DC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nikki", "Last Name": "Shearman", "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Innovation, Reach out and Read, Boston, MA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "38083319", "Title": "Methodology for Safe and Effective Subcutaneous Implantation of Wireless Biotelemetry Sensor Devices in Rodents.", "Abstract": "In this work, a methodology for assessing the impact of implantation surgery on laboratory mice on behavior was created. The study included the design of several implants fabricated on various printed circuit board (PCB) technologies with overall diameters between 26-28mm and weights between 4.5-6.5g. 11 adult CD1 mice were implanted with the devices and their behavior was analyzed using common behavioral benchmark tests. The results show that implants designed to be 10% of the animal's body weight showed no adverse effects on mobility or social behavior. These results illustrate a method to identify and reduce the adverse behavioral changes inherent to device implantation. Additional considerations for implant surgery are provided. These results are validated with the implantation of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless sensor tag. The implanted wireless tag showed an average Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of 62.96dBm with a standard deviation of 4.95dBm and a variance of 24.5 dBm2. The high RSSI and variance values show that the implant was working well inside of the mouse's body and that the mouse was fully recovered and readily exploring its surroundings.Clinical Relevance-This work 1) studies the behavioral impact of implantable wireless biopotential devices. This will help clinical researchers conducting behavioral studies using sensor implants. 2) demonstrates a working implanted BLE wireless model inside of a mouse.

However, the mitochondria-behavior relationship has not been systematically studied at a brain-wide scale. Here we examined the association between multiple features of mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and stress-related behaviors in male mice with diverse behavioral phenotypes. Miniaturized assays of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content were deployed on 571 samples across 17 brain areas, defining specific patterns of mito-behavior associations. By applying multi-slice network analysis to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset, we identified three large-scale networks of brain areas with shared mitochondrial signatures. A major network composed of cortico-striatal areas exhibited the strongest mitochondria-behavior correlations, accounting for up to 50% of animal-to-animal behavioral differences, suggesting that this mito-based network is functionally significant. The mito-based brain networks also overlapped with regional gene expression and structural connectivity, and exhibited distinct\u00a0molecular mitochondrial phenotype signatures.

We performed an observational cross-sectional study with convenience sampling using direct patient reports from 1918 postpartum and 3868 pregnant individuals collected between April 2020 and December 2020 from 10 states across the USA. We leverage a subgroup of these participants who gave birth prior to March 2020 to estimate the pre-pandemic prevalence of specific birthing practices as a comparison. Our primary analyses describe the prevalence and timing of perinatal care changes, compare perinatal care changes depending on when and where individuals gave birth, and assess the linkage between perinatal care alterations and maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms. Seventy-eight percent of pregnant participants and 63% of postpartum participants reported at least one change to their perinatal care between March and August 2020. However, the prevalence and nature of specific perinatal care changes occurred unevenly over time and across geographic locations. The separation of infants and mothers immediately after birth and the cancelation of prenatal visits were associated with worsened depression and anxiety symptoms in mothers after controlling for sociodemographic factors, mental health history, number of pregnancy complications, and general stress about the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analyses reveal widespread changes to perinatal care across the US that fluctuated depending on where and when individuals gave birth. Disruptions to perinatal care may also exacerbate mental health concerns, so focused treatments that can mitigate the negative psychiatric sequelae of interrupted care are warranted.", "Keywords": ["Coronavirus", "Depression", "Mental health", "Postpartum", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal care"], "MeSH terms": ["Anxiety", "COVID-19", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Mental Health", "Pandemics", "Perinatal Care", "Pregnancy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cassandra L", "Last Name": "Hendrix", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

As the pandemic has progressed, evidence has emerged reconfirming the value of human milk and the importance of protecting and supporting breastfeeding, especially the initiation of lactation. However, it is clear that COVID-19 has changed the clinical care paradigm around breastfeeding and lactation support and, as such, it is imperative that practices adapt and evolve to maintain the emphasis on lactation support. We participated in a round table conference aiming to rescue and develop protocols and practices that support breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. One key area to target will be to maximize the use of the antenatal period. The early identification of lactation risk factors together with the development of person-centered methods to deliver breastfeeding information and education to parents-to-be will be critical. In addition, the establishment of a hospital culture that values breastfeeding and prioritizes the use of human milk will be integral for the motivation of health care professionals. That culture will also support active management of the initiation of lactation and the development of a 'back-up plan' toolkit to support the mother experiencing lactation difficulties. Post-discharge support will also be crucial with the development of both in-person and virtual lactation support programs, in particular for the immediate post-discharge period to benefit mothers who experience an early discharge process. These measures will allow for a new, adapted framework of practice that acknowledges the current COVID-19 paradigm and maintains the emphasis on the need to protect and support breastfeeding and the use of human milk.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "breastfeeding", "clinical practice", "human milk", "pandemic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Johannes B", "Last Name": "van Goudoever", "Affiliation": "Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Diane L", "Last Name": "Spatz", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing & Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Hoban", "Affiliation": "The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Gyamfi-Bannerman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Berns", "Affiliation": "Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Klink f\u00fcr Neonatologie, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Liz", "Last Name": "McKechnie", "Affiliation": "Leeds Centre for Newborn Care, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Davanzo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Maternal and Child Health Institute, IRCCS \"Burlo Garofolo\", Trieste, Italy."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35499846", "Title": "COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Neurodevelopment?-Reply.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Humans", "Pandemics", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Morgan R", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lauren C", "Last Name": "Shuffrey", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}], "Journal": "JAMA pediatrics", "PubDate": "2022Jul01"}, {"PMID": "35444294", "Title": "Pandemic beyond the virus: maternal COVID-related postnatal stress is associated with infant temperament.", "Abstract": "Studies have shown that infant temperament varies with maternal psychosocial factors, in utero illness, and environmental stressors.

"The impact of COVID-19-related stress on perinatal women is of heightened public health concern given the established intergenerational impact of maternal stress-exposure on infants and fetuses. There is urgent need to characterize the coping styles associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the potential for lasting sequelae on both mothers and infants. This study uses a data-driven approach to identify the patterns of behavioral coping strategies that associate with maternal psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large multicenter sample of pregnant women (N\u2009=\u20092876) and postpartum women (N\u2009=\u20091536). Data was collected from 9 states across the United States from March to October 2020. Women reported behaviors they were engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, symptoms of depression, anxiety and global psychological distress, as well as changes in energy levels, sleep quality and stress levels. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies. Critically, phenotypes with high levels of passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods) were associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and global psychological distress, as well as worsening stress and energy levels, relative to other coping phenotypes. In contrast, phenotypes with high levels of active coping strategies (social support, and self-care) were associated with greater resiliency relative to other phenotypes. The identification of these widespread coping phenotypes reveals novel behavioral patterns associated with risk and resiliency to pandemic-related stress in perinatal women. These findings may contribute to early identification of women at risk for poor long-term outcomes and indicate malleable targets for interventions aimed at mitigating lasting sequelae on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Anxiety", "COVID-19", "Female", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Postpartum Period", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Psychological Distress", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Denise M", "Last Name": "Werchan", "Affiliation": "NYU Langone Health, New York, USA.

Based on the available literature, we conclude vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare, and exposed neonates generally show favorable health outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Pregnancy", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margaret H", "Last Name": "Kyle", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Maha", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Victoria", "Last Name": "Saltz", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Mollicone", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Bence", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}], "Journal": "Clinical obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2022Mar01"}, {"PMID": "34991997", "Title": "Postpartum sleep health in a multiethnic cohort of women during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City.", "Abstract": "Cross-sectional study to examine the determinants of sleep health among postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC).", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "disparities", "ethnicity", "mother", "postpartum", "race"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "New York City", "Postpartum Period", "Pregnancy", "Sleep", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maristella", "Last Name": "Lucchini", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret H", "Last Name": "Kyle", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ayesha", "Last Name": "Sania", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicol\u00f2", "Last Name": "Pini", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "Babineau", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan R", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristina R", "Last Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren C", "Last Name": "Shuffrey", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer R", "Last Name": "Barbosa", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Psychiatry Department, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA;

aggressive behavior and dopamine system hyperactivity is associated with elevated aggression. However, the causal role of dopamine in aggression and its target circuit mechanisms are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the modulatory role of the population- and projection-specific dopamine function in a murine model of aggressive behavior. We find that terminal activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons selectively projecting to the lateral septum (LS) is sufficient for promoting aggression and necessary for establishing baseline aggression. Within the LS, dopamine acts on D2-receptors to inhibit GABAergic neurons, and septal D2-signaling is necessary for VTA dopaminergic activity to promote aggression. Collectively, our data reveal a powerful modulatory influence of dopaminergic synaptic input on LS function and aggression, effectively linking the clinically pertinent hyper-dopaminergic model of aggression with the classic septal-hypothalamic aggression axis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aggression", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "GABAergic Neurons", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Neural Pathways", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Septum of Brain", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Darshini", "Last Name": "Mahadevia", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rinki", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessia", "Last Name": "Manganaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division for Child and Adolescent Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nao", "Last Name": "Chuhma", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Ziolkowski-Blake", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashlea A", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Ansorge", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ma2362@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2021Nov23"}, {"PMID": "34799681", "Title": "Structure and function differences in the prelimbic cortex to basolateral amygdala circuit mediate trait vulnerability in a novel model of acute social defeat stress in male mice.", "Abstract": "Stressful life events are ubiquitous and well-known to negatively impact mental health. However, in both humans and animal models, there is large individual variability in how individuals respond to stress, with some but not all experiencing long-term adverse consequences. While there is growing understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of the stress response, much less is known about how neurocircuits shaped by lifetime experiences are activated during an initial stressor and contribute to this selective vulnerability versus resilience. We developed a model of acute social defeat stress (ASDS) that allows classification of male mice into \"susceptible\" (socially avoidant) versus \"resilient\" (expressing control-level social approach) one hour after exposure to six minutes of social stress. Using circuit tracing and high-resolution confocal imaging, we explored differences in activation and dendritic spine density and morphology in the prelimbic cortex to basolateral amygdala (PL\u2192BLA) circuit in resilient versus susceptible mice. Susceptible mice had greater PL\u2192BLA recruitment during ASDS and activated PL\u2192BLA neurons from susceptible mice had more and larger mushroom spines compared to resilient mice. We hypothesized identified structure/function differences indicate an overactive PL\u2192BLA response in susceptible mice and used an intersectional chemogenetic approach to inhibit the PL\u2192BLA circuit during or prior to ASDS. We found in both cases that this blocked ASDS-induced social avoidance. Overall, we show PL\u2192BLA structure/function differences mediate divergent behavioral responses to ASDS in male mice. These results support PL\u2192BLA circuit overactivity during stress as a biomarker of trait vulnerability and potential target for prevention of stress-induced psychopathology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amygdala", "Animals", "Basolateral Nuclear Complex", "Male", "Mice", "Neurons", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Social Defeat", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yael S", "Last Name": "Grossman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clementine", "Last Name": "Fillinger", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessia", "Last Name": "Manganaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Voren", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Waldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William G", "Last Name": "Janssen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Kenny", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. dani.dumitriu@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2022Feb"}, {"PMID": "34561359", "Title": "The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 on newborns.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the available literature regarding effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on newborns, ranging from effects related to in utero and perinatal exposure to maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to pandemic-related stress and socioeconomic changes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Pandemics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margaret H", "Last Name": "Kyle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics."}], "Journal": "Current opinion in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2021Dec01"}, {"PMID": "33914045", "Title": "Understanding Risk for Newborns Born to SARS-CoV-2-Positive Mothers.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Mothers", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Gyamfi-Bannerman", "Affiliation": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "JAMA", "PubDate": "2021May25"}, {"PMID": "33472826", "Title": "Highlights from the Era of Open Source Web-Based Tools.", "Abstract": "High digital connectivity and a focus on reproducibility are contributing to an open science revolution in neuroscience.

The Neanderthals inhabited cooler and more seasonal periods than the modern human, evincing childhood developmental stress during wintertime.

Aged monkeys have impaired working memory, and we have previously shown that this age-induced cognitive impairment is partially mediated by a loss of thin spines in prefrontal cortex area 46, a critical area for working memory. Because area 46 is reciprocally connected with area 7a of the parietal cortex and 7a mediates visual attention integration, we hypothesized that thin spine density in area 7a would correlate with working memory performance as well. To investigate the synaptic profile of area 7a and its relevance to working memory and cognitive aging, we investigated differences in spine type and density in layer III pyramidal cells of area 7a in young and aged, male and female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were cognitively assessed using the delayed response test of working memory. Area 7a shows age-related loss of thin spines, and thin spine density positively correlates with delayed response performance in aged monkeys. In contrast, these cells show no age-related changes in dendritic length or branching. These changes mirror age-related changes in area 46 but are distinct from other neocortical regions, such as V1. These findings support our hypothesis that cognitive aging is driven primarily by synaptic changes, and more specifically by changes in thin spines, in key association areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study advances our understanding of cognitive aging by demonstrating the relevance of area 7a thin spines to working memory performance. This study is the first to look at cognitive aging in the intraparietal sulcus, and also the first to report spine or dendritic measures for area 7a in either young adult or aged nonhuman primates. These results contribute to the hypothesis that thin spines support working memory performance and confirm our prior observation that cognitive aging is driven by synaptic changes rather than changes in dendritic morphology or neuron death. Importantly, these data show that age-related working memory changes are not limited to disruptions of the prefrontal cortex but also include an association region heavily interconnected with prefrontal cortex.", "Keywords": ["aging", "area 7a", "dendritic spines", "primate", "thin spines", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Cell Death", "Dendritic Spines", "Female", "Forecasting", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Short-Term", "Parietal Lobe", "Random Allocation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Motley", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Yael S", "Last Name": "Grossman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "William G M", "Last Name": "Janssen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Mark G", "Last Name": "Baxter", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Peter R", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Neurocognitive Aging Section, National Institute of Aging, Baltimore, Maryland 21214."}, {"First Name": "Dani", "Last Name": "Dumitriu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "John H", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029, jhmorrison@ucdavis.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Dec05"}, {"PMID": "29875653", "Title": "Cell-Type Specific Changes in Glial Morphology and Glucocorticoid Expression During Stress and Aging in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex.", "Abstract": "Repeated exposure to stressors is known to produce large-scale remodeling of neurons within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Recent work suggests stress-related forms of structural plasticity can interact with aging to drive distinct patterns of pyramidal cell morphological changes. However, little is known about how other cellular components within PFC might be affected by these challenges. Here, we examined the effects of stress exposure and aging on medial prefrontal cortical glial subpopulations. Interestingly, we found no changes in glial morphology with stress exposure but a profound morphological change with aging. Furthermore, we found an upregulation of non-nuclear glucocorticoid receptors (GR) with aging, while nuclear levels remained largely unaffected. Both changes are selective for microglia, with no stress or aging effect found in astrocytes. Lastly, we show that the changes found within microglia inversely correlated with the density of dendritic spines on layer III pyramidal cells.

Although neuron death is minimal in the absence of AD, age-related cognitive decline does occur in animals as well as humans, and it decreases quality of life for elderly people. Age-related cognitive decline has been linked to synapse loss and/or alterations of synaptic proteins that impair function in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These synaptic alterations are likely reversible, such that maintenance of synaptic health in the face of aging is a critically important therapeutic goal. Here, we show that riluzole can protect against some of the synaptic alterations in hippocampus that are linked to age-related memory loss in rats. Riluzole increases glutamate uptake through glial transporters and is thought to decrease glutamate spillover to extrasynaptic NMDA receptors while increasing synaptic glutamatergic activity. Treated aged rats were protected against age-related cognitive decline displayed in nontreated aged animals. Memory performance correlated with density of thin spines on apical dendrites in CA1, although not with mushroom spines. Furthermore, riluzole-treated rats had an increase in clustering of thin spines that correlated with memory performance and was specific to the apical, but not the basilar, dendrites of CA1. Clustering of synaptic inputs is thought to allow nonlinear summation of synaptic strength.
