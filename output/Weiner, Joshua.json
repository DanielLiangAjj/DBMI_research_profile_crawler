[{"PMID": "38463964", "Title": "Astrocyte morphogenesis requires self-recognition.", "Abstract": "Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1-4. Clustered protocadherins (Pcdh), comprising a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, play a pivotal role in neuronal self-avoidance required for mammalian brain development5-7. The probabilistic expression of different Pcdh isoforms confers unique identities upon neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism exists in astrocytes, the other predominant cell type of the brain, remains unknown. Here, we report that a specific isoform in the Pcdh\u03b3 cluster, \u03b3C3, is highly enriched in human and murine astrocytes. Through genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that \u03b3C3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine if \u03b3C3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of \u03b3C3 chimeric proteins capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expressing complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same \u03b3C3 null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric \u03b3C3 proteins individually expressed in single \u03b3C3 null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition is essential for astrocyte development in the mammalian brain and that, by contrast to neuronal self-recognition, a single Pcdh isoform is both necessary and sufficient for this process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "S", "Last Name": "Zipursky", "Affiliation": "UCLA/HHMI."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "University of California Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "Alina", "Last Name": "Sergeeva", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Ahlsen", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Kerry", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Baljit", "Last Name": "Khakh", "Affiliation": "UCLA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "The University of Iowa."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2024Feb22"}, {"PMID": "38422982", "Title": "Dynamic establishment of recipient resident memory T cell repertoire after human intestinal transplantation.", "Abstract": "Understanding formation of the human tissue resident memory T cell (TRM) repertoire requires longitudinal access to human non-lymphoid tissues.", "Keywords": ["Dynamic reconstitution", "Human intestinal transplantation (ITx)", "T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire", "TCR\u03b2 sequencing", "Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM)"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Memory T Cells", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Ileum", "Allografts", "Immunologic Memory", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenyu", "Last Name": "Jiao", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States;

However, tissue rejection and graft-versus-host disease are relatively common complications, necessitating aggressive immunosuppression that can itself pose further complications. Tracking intraluminal markers in ileal effluent from standard ileostomies may present a noninvasive and sensitive way to detect developing pathology within the intestinal graft. This would be an improvement compared to current assessments, which are limited by poor sensitivity and specificity, contributing to under or over-immunosuppression, respectively, and by the need for invasive biopsies. Herein, we report an approach to reproducibly analyze ileal fluid obtained through stoma sampling for antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations, reasoning that these molecules may provide an assessment of intestinal homeostasis and levels of intestinal inflammation over time. Concentrations of lysozyme (LYZ), myeloperoxidase (MPO), calprotectin (S100A8/A9) and \u03b2-defensin 2 (DEFB2) were assessed using adaptations of commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The concentration of \u03b1-defensin 5 (DEFA5) was assessed using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. Our data support that with proper preparation of ileal effluent specimens, precise and replicable determination of antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations can be achieved for each of these target molecules via ELISA.

Following intestinal transplantation (ITx), surveillance ileal mucosal biopsies provide a unique opportunity to map the dynamic establishment of gut lymphocyte populations. Using polychromatic flow cytometry that includes HLA allele group-specific mAbs distinguishing donor from recipient cells along with high throughput BCR sequencing, we tracked the establishment of recipient B cell populations and BCR repertoire in the allograft mucosa of ITx recipients. We confirm the early presence of na\u00efve donor B cells in the circulation and, for the first time, document the establishment of recipient B cell populations, including B resident memory cells, in the intestinal allograft mucosa. Recipient B cell repopulation of the allograft was most rapid in infant (<1 year old)-derived allografts and, unlike T cell repopulation, did not correlate with rejection rates. While recipient memory B cell populations were increased in graft mucosa compared to circulation, na\u00efve recipient B cells remained detectable in the graft mucosa for years. Comparisons of peripheral and intra-mucosal B cell repertoires in the absence of rejection revealed increased BCR mutation rates and clonal expansion in graft mucosa compared to circulating B cells, but these parameters did not increase markedly after the first year post-transplant. Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults.

Performing liver transplantation in cynomolgus monkeys is challenging because they poorly tolerate portal vein clamping during the anhepatic phase. Finding an alternative to portal vein clamping is necessary before preclinical liver transplant models can be performed with reliable outcomes. We used 3 different techniques to perform 5 liver transplants in male cynomolgus macaques (weight, 7.4-10.8 kg; mismatched for MHC I and II; matched for ABO). In procedure A, we clamped the portal vein briefly, as in human transplants, as well as the superior mesentery artery to minimize congestion at the expense of temporary ischemia (n = 2). In procedure B, we performed a temporary portocaval shunt with extracorporeal venovenous bypass (n = 1). For procedure C, we developed an H-shunt system (modified portocaval shunt) with extracorporeal bypass (n = 2). Postoperative immunosuppression comprised cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Recipients in procedure A developed hemodynamic instability and were euthanized within 2 d. The recipient that underwent procedure B was euthanized within 11 d due to inferior vena caval thrombosis. The H-shunt in procedure C led to minimal PV congestion during the anhepatic phase, and both recipients reached the 21-d survival endpoint with good graft function. Our novel H-shunt bypass system resulted in successful liver transplantation in cynomolgus macaques, with long-term posttransplant survival possible.

In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections.

CMV-specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, highest in blood, bone marrow (BM), or lymph nodes (LN), with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues.

High frequencies of activated CMV-specific T cells were found in blood and BM samples with low virus detection, whereas in lung, CMV-specific T cells were present along with detectable virus. In LNs, CMV-specific T cells exhibited quiescent phenotypes independent of virus. Overall, T cell differentiation was enhanced in sites of viral persistence with age. Together, our results suggest tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control shaped by both viral and tissue-intrinsic factors, with global effects on homeostasis of tissue T cells over the lifespan.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Lymph Nodes", "T-Lymphocytes", "Viremia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire L", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Miron", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Joseph J C", "Last Name": "Thome", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Nobuhide", "Last Name": "Matsuoka", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Rak", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721."}, {"First Name": "Suzu", "Last Name": "Igarashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721."}, {"First Name": "Tomer", "Last Name": "Granot", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Harvey", "Last Name": "Lerner", "Affiliation": "LiveOnNY, New York, NY 10001."}, {"First Name": "Felicia", "Last Name": "Goodrum", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 df2396@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2017Mar06"}, {"PMID": "27941430", "Title": "Long-term Persistence of Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut After Intestinal Transplantation.", "Abstract": "Little is known about innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations in the human gut, and the turnover of these cells and their subsets after transplantation has not been described.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biopsy", "Cells, Cultured", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Intestines", "Lymphocytes", "Lymphoid Tissue", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Transplantation", "Time Factors", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation Chimera"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "1 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY. 2 Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY. 3 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Columbia University, New York, NY. 4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Zuber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brittany", "Last Name": "Shonts", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suxiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Kato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "27538862", "Title": "Distinctive Leukocyte Subpopulations According to Organ Type in Cynomolgus Macaques.", "Abstract": "Cynomolgus macaques (CYNO; Macaca fascicularis) are a well-established NHP model used for studies in immunology. To provide reference values on the baseline cell distributions in the hematopoietic and lymphoid organs (HLO) of these animals, we used flow cytometry to analyze the peripheral blood, bone marrow, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus of a cohort of male, adult, research-na\u00efve, Mauritian CYNO. Our findings demonstrate that several cell distribution patterns differ between CYNO and humans. First, the CD4(+):CD8(+) T-cell ratio is lower in CYNO compared with humans. Second, the peripheral blood of CYNO contains a population of CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells. Third, the CD31 level was elevated in all organs studied, suggesting that CD31 may not be an accurate marker of recent thymic emigrants within the CD4(+) T cells of CYNO. Finally the B-cell population is lower in CYNO compared with humans. In summary, although the majority of immune cell populations are similar between cynomolgus macaques and humans, several important differences should be considered when using CYNO in immunologic studies.

No previous study has evaluated APOLT specifically for preadolescent children with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). This population might benefit especially based on greater capacity for liver regeneration. Data from 13 preadolescent children who underwent APOLT were compared to 13 matched controls who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for FHF from 1996 to 2013. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or survival between the 2 groups. However, all surviving OLT recipients (10/13) remain on ISP, while all but 1 surviving APOLT recipient (12/13) showed native liver regeneration, and the first 10 recipients (76.9%) are currently off ISP with 2 additional patients currently weaning. In our experience, APOLT produced excellent survival and high rates of native liver regeneration in preadolescent children with FHF. This represents the largest series to date to report such outcomes. Liberating these children from lifelong ISP without the downside of increased surgical morbidity makes APOLT an attractive alternative. In conclusion, we therefore propose that, with the availability of technical expertise and with the technical modifications above, APOLT for FHF should be strongly considered for preteenage children with FHF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Infant", "Liver", "Liver Failure, Acute", "Liver Regeneration", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Tissue Donors", "Treatment Outcome", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Griesemer", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Eddie", "Last Name": "Island", "Affiliation": "Division of Transplant Surgery, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Lobritto", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Gennaro", "Last Name": "Selvaggi", "Affiliation": "Miami Transplant Institute, University of Miami Health System, Miami, FL."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Velasco", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Panagiotis", "Last Name": "Tryphonopoulos", "Affiliation": "Miami Transplant Institute, University of Miami Health System, Miami, FL."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Tzakis", "Affiliation": "Department of General and Vascular Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, Weston, FL."}, {"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Kato", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "26289503", "Title": "Ex vivo pancreaticoduodenectomy and liver autotransplantation for pancreatic head tumor with extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pancreaticoduodenectomy", "Transplantation, Autologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nobuhide", "Last Name": "Matsuoka", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joshua I", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Adam D", "Last Name": "Griesemer", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin B", "Last Name": "Samstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yejun", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Kato", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}, {"PMID": "25041331", "Title": "The use of bi-planar tissue expanders to augment abdominal domain in a pediatric intestinal transplant recipient.", "Abstract": "Intestinal transplantation is a well-accepted treatment for SBS. However, patients with SBS often have decreased abdominal capacity, which makes size-matching of donor organs more difficult, thus decreasing organ availability. Reported approaches for addressing this problem include surgically reducing the graft size, leaving an open abdomen for a prolonged period, and cotransplanting rectus fascia as a non-vascularized allograft. Each approach has significant disadvantages. There has been one previous report of tissue expanders used intra-abdominally and two reports of subcutaneous use to increase intra-abdominal capacity prior to transplantation. We report the first use of bi-planar expander placement for this purpose. In our case, a two-yr-old male child with SBS due to malrotation was treated with tissue expanders 10\u00a0months prior to intestinal transplantation, thus allowing transplantation of a larger graft with the ability to close the abdomen safely. There were no complications, and the patient is now doing well and tolerating diet off PN. The use of tissue expanders prior to intestinal transplantation is a promising approach for such patients and avoids the morbidity associated with other approaches.
