However, determining AF for frameshift-inducing small insertions and deletions (indels) faces challenges due to discrepancies in mapping and variant calling methods. Here, we propose an innovative approach to assess indel AF. We developed CRAFTS-indels (Calculating Regional Allele Frequency Targeting Small indels), an algorithm that combines AF of distinct indels within a given region and provides \"regional AF\" (rAF). We tested and validated CRAFTS-indels using three independent datasets: gnomAD v2 (n=125,748 samples), an internal dataset (IGM; n=39,367), and the UK BioBank (UKBB; n=469,835). By comparing rAF against standard AF, we identified rare indels with rAF exceeding standard AF (sAF\u226410-4 and rAF>10-4) as \"rAF-hi\" indels. Notably, a high percentage of rare indels were \"rAF-hi\", with a higher proportion in gnomAD v2 (11-20%) and IGM (11-22%) compared to the UKBB (5-9% depending on the CRAFTS-indels' parameters). Analysis of the overlap of regions based on their rAF with low complexity regions and with ClinVar classification supported the pertinence of rAF. Using the internal dataset, we illustrated the utility of CRAFTS-indel in the analysis of de novo variants and the potential negative impact of rAF-hi indels in gene discovery. In summary, annotation of indels with cohort specific rAF can be used to handle some of the limitations of current annotation pipelines and facilitate detection of novel gene disease associations. CRAFTS-indels offers a user-friendly approach to providing rAF annotation. It can be integrated into public databases such as gnomAD, UKBB and used by ClinVar to revise indel classifications.", "Keywords": ["Allele frequencies", "Bioinformatic pipeline", "Genomic mapping", "Insertions and deletions", "Variants annotation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "INDEL Mutation", "Gene Frequency", "Algorithms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarath Babu", "Last Name": "Krishna Murthy", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandy", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shiraz", "Last Name": "Bheda", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikita", "Last Name": "Tomar", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiyue", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amir", "Last Name": "Yaghoobi", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atlas", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua E", "Last Name": "Motelow", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hila", "Last Name": "Milo Rasouly", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Sonic-hedgehog signalling proteins localize to the cellular organelle primary cilia. We therefore explored the hypothesis that cilia gene variants may underlie hitherto unsolved cases of sporadic hypothalamic hamartoma. We performed high-depth exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray on surgically resected hypothalamic hamartoma tissue and paired leukocyte-derived DNA from 27 patients. We searched for both germline and somatic variants under both dominant and bi-allelic genetic models. In hamartoma-derived DNA of seven patients we identified bi-allelic (one germline, one somatic) variants within one of four cilia genes-DYNC2I1, DYNC2H1, IFT140 or SMO. In eight patients, we identified single somatic variants in the previously established hypothalamic hamartoma disease genes GLI3 or OFD1.

Recent work suggests that focal temporal lobe seizures depress subcortical arousal systems and convert cortical activity into a pattern resembling slow-wave sleep. The potential simultaneous and paradoxical role of the thalamus in both limbic seizure propagation, and in sleep-like cortical rhythms has not been investigated. We recorded neuronal activity from the central lateral (CL), anterior (ANT), and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei of the thalamus in an established female rat model of focal limbic seizures. We found that population firing of neurons in CL decreased during seizures while the cortex exhibited slow waves. In contrast, ANT showed a trend toward increased neuronal firing compatible with polyspike seizure discharges seen in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, VPM exhibited a remarkable increase in sleep spindles during focal seizures. Single-unit juxtacellular recordings from CL demonstrated reduced overall firing rates, but a switch in firing pattern from single spikes to burst firing during seizures. These findings suggest that different thalamic nuclei play very different roles in focal limbic seizures. While limbic nuclei, such as ANT, appear to participate directly in seizure propagation, arousal nuclei, such as CL, may contribute to depressed cortical function, whereas sleep spindles in relay nuclei, such as VPM, may interrupt thalamocortical information flow. These combined effects could be critical for controlling both seizure severity and impairment of consciousness. Further understanding of differential effects of seizures on different thalamocortical networks may lead to improved treatments directly targeting these modes of impaired function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Temporal lobe epilepsy has a major negative impact on quality of life. Previous work suggests that the thalamus plays a critical role in thalamocortical network modulation and subcortical arousal maintenance, but its precise seizure-associated functions are not known. We recorded neuronal activity in three different thalamic regions and found divergent activity patterns, which may respectively participate in seizure propagation, impaired level of conscious arousal, and altered relay of information to the cortex during focal limbic seizures. These very different activity patterns within the thalamus may help explain why focal temporal lobe seizures often disrupt widespread network function, and can help guide future treatments aimed at restoring normal thalamocortical network activity and cognition.", "Keywords": ["burst firing", "consciousness", "juxtacellular recording", "sleep", "temporal lobe epilepsy", "thalamus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Waves", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Limbic System", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Seizures", "Sleep", "Temporal Lobe", "Thalamic Nuclei"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Joshua E", "Last Name": "Motelow", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Chanthia", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Biche", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Cian", "Last Name": "McCafferty", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Mengran", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Qiong", "Last Name": "Zhan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruonan", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China, and."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Duque", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience, and."}, {"First Name": "Hal", "Last Name": "Blumenfeld", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, hal.blumenfeld@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2017Nov22"}, {"PMID": "26937010", "Title": "Impaired Serotonergic Brainstem Function during and after Seizures.", "Abstract": "Impaired breathing, cardiac function, and arousal during and after seizures are important causes of morbidity and mortality.

Lower brainstem serotonergic systems are postulated to play an important role in cardiorespiratory changes during and after seizures, whereas upper brainstem serotonergic and other systems regulate arousal. However, direct demonstration of seizure-associated neuronal activity changes in brainstem serotonergic regions has been lacking. Here, we performed multiunit and single-unit recordings from medullary raphe and midbrain dorsal raphe nuclei in an established rat seizure model while measuring changes in breathing rate and depth as well as heart rate. Serotonergic neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation were all significantly decreased during and after seizures in this model. We found that population firing of neurons in the medullary and midbrain raphe on multiunit recordings was significantly decreased during the ictal and post-ictal periods. Single-unit recordings from identified serotonergic neurons in the medullary raphe revealed highly consistently decreased firing during and after seizures. In contrast, firing of midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons was more variable, with a mixture of increases and decreases. The markedly suppressed firing of medullary serotonergic neurons supports their possible role in simultaneously impaired cardiorespiratory function in seizures.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a rodent model, we found increased activity in regions known to depress cortical function, including lateral septum and anterior hypothalamus. Importantly, we found suppression of intralaminar thalamic and brainstem arousal systems and suppression of the cortex. At a cellular level, we found reduced firing of identified cholinergic neurons in the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and basal forebrain. Finally, we used enzyme-based amperometry to demonstrate reduced cholinergic neurotransmission in both cortex and thalamus.

Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated widespread cortical decreases in the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal that may play an important role in the pathophysiology of these seizures. Animal models could provide an opportunity to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of these changes, however they have so far failed to consistently replicate the cortical fMRI decreases observed in human patients. This may be due to important differences between human seizures and animal models, including a lack of cortical development in rodents or differences in the frequencies of rodent (7-8 Hz) and human (3-4 Hz) spike-wave discharges. To examine the possible contributions of these differences, we developed a ferret model that exhibits 3-4 Hz spike-wave seizures in the presence of a sulcated cortex. Measurements of BOLD fMRI and simultaneous EEG demonstrated cortical fMRI increases during and following spike-wave seizures in ferrets. However unlike human patients, significant fMRI decreases were not observed. The lack of fMRI decreases was consistent across seizures of different durations, discharge frequencies, and anesthetic regimes, and using fMRI analysis models similar to human patients. In contrast, generalized tonic-clonic seizures under the same conditions elicited sustained postictal fMRI decreases, verifying that the lack of fMRI decreases with spike-wave was not due to technical factors. These findings demonstrate that 3-4 Hz spike-wave discharge in a sulcated animal model does not necessarily produce fMRI decreases, leaving the mechanism for this phenomenon open for further investigation.", "Keywords": ["Absence seizures", "Consciousness", "Default mode network", "EEG\u2013fMRI", "Epilepsy", "Negative BOLD", "Petit mal"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Absence", "Female", "Ferrets", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark W", "Last Name": "Youngblood", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "William C", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Asht M", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Core Center for Quantitative Neuroscience with Magnetic Resonance (QNMR), New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Enamandram", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Basavaraju G", "Last Name": "Sanganahalli", "Affiliation": "Core Center for Quantitative Neuroscience with Magnetic Resonance (QNMR), New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua E", "Last Name": "Motelow", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harrison X", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Flavio", "Last Name": "Frohlich", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Gribizis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexis", "Last Name": "Lighten", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fahmeed", "Last Name": "Hyder", "Affiliation": "Core Center for Quantitative Neuroscience with Magnetic Resonance (QNMR), New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hal", "Last Name": "Blumenfeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Core Center for Quantitative Neuroscience with Magnetic Resonance (QNMR), New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Neurobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.
