Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shoufu", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Panagiota E", "Last Name": "Apostolou", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Niigata Universiry, Niigata, Niigata, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Gallitto", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tara", "Last Name": "Barron", "Affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Stanford University, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pamelyn J", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Hua", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hong-Jian", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "McQuillan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kyung-Don", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Alabama, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gregory K", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cheng-Chia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rintaro", "Last Name": "Hashizume", "Affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher R", "Last Name": "Vakoc", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Monje", "Affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Gogos", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2024May20"}, {"PMID": "37968289", "Title": "Altered corollary discharge signaling in the auditory cortex of a mouse model of schizophrenia predisposition.", "Abstract": "The ability to distinguish sensations that are self-generated from those caused by external events is disrupted in schizophrenia patients.

The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus.

In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls.

Thus, understanding whether and how novelty prepares, or primes, brain circuitry to facilitate cognitive flexibility has important translational relevance. Exposure to novelty recruits the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)2 and may prime hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry for subsequent learning-associated plasticity. Here we show that novelty resets the neural circuits that link the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the mPFC, facilitating the ability to overcome an established strategy. Exposing mice to novelty disrupted a previously encoded strategy by reorganizing vHPC activity to local theta (4-12\u00a0Hz) oscillations and weakening existing vHPC-mPFC connectivity. As mice subsequently adapted to a new task, vHPC neurons developed new task-associated activity, vHPC-mPFC connectivity was strengthened, and mPFC neurons updated to encode the new rules. Without novelty, however,\u00a0mice adhered to their established strategy. Blocking dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) or inhibiting novelty-tagged cells that express D1Rs in the vHPC prevented these behavioural and physiological effects of novelty. Furthermore, activation of D1Rs mimicked the effects of novelty. These results suggest that novelty promotes adaptive learning by D1R-mediated resetting of vHPC-mPFC circuitry, thereby enabling subsequent\u00a0learning-associated circuit plasticity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Pathways", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alan J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. alanjpark2014@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Alexander Z", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly M", "Last Name": "Martyniuk", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Yuan", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atheir I", "Last Name": "Abbas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Lowes", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Kellendonk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Gogos", "Affiliation": "The Mortimer B.

Of these, genetic animal models that are modeled after rare but highly penetrant mutations hold great promise for deciphering critical molecular, synaptic, and neurocircuitry deficits of major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Animal models should aim to focus on core aspects rather than capture the entire human disease. In this context, animal models with strong etiological validity, where behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes and the features of the disease being modeled are in unambiguous homology, are being used to dissect both elementary and complex cognitive and perceptual processing deficits present in psychiatric disorders at the level of neurocircuitry, shedding new light on critical disease mechanisms.

Alterations of endogenous metabolite concentrations can arise in multiple ways. Marked derangements of single endogenous small-molecule metabolites are found in a large group of rare genetic human diseases termed \"inborn errors of metabolism\", many of which are associated with prominent neuropsychiatric symptomology. Whether such metabolites act neuroactively to directly lead to distinct neural dysfunction has been frequently hypothesized but rarely demonstrated unequivocally. Here we discuss this disease concept in the context of our recent findings demonstrating that neural dysfunction arising from accumulation of the schizophrenia-associated metabolite l-proline is due to its structural mimicry of the neurotransmitter GABA that leads to alterations in GABA-ergic short-term synaptic plasticity. For cases in which a similar direct action upon neurotransmitter binding sites is suspected, we lay out a systematic approach that can be extended to assessing the potential disruptive action of such candidate disease metabolites. To address the potentially important and broader role in neuropsychiatric disease, we also consider whether the more subtle yet more ubiquitous variations in endogenous metabolites arising from natural allelic variation may likewise contribute to disease risk but in a more complex and nuanced manner.", "Keywords": ["22q11.2 deletion syndrome", "Psychiatric disease", "inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)", "metabolites", "metabolomics", "neurological disease", "neurotransmitters", "synaptic plasticity"], "MeSH terms": ["DiGeorge Syndrome", "Humans", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Metabolomics", "Molecular Mimicry", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Proline", "Proline Oxidase", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gregg W", "Last Name": "Crabtree", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics , Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Gogos", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics , Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Sep19"}, {"PMID": "29666363", "Title": "Altered function and maturation of primary cortical neurons from a 22q11.2 deletion mouse model of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Given its high penetrance, clearly delineated and evolutionary conserved genomic structure, mouse models of the 22q11.2 deletion provide an ideal organism-based and cell-based model of this well-established disease mutation for schizophrenia. In this study we examined the development of changes in intrinsic properties, action potential firing and synaptic transmission using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of cultured embryonic cortical neurons from Df(16)A +/- and WT mice at DIV7 and DIV14, respectively. Compared to neurons from the WT littermates, significantly increased input resistance and decreased rising rate of action potential was observed in Df(16)A +/- mice at DIV7 but not at DIV14 indicative of delayed neuronal maturation. Neurons from Df(16)A +/- mice also showed significantly higher cellular excitability at both DIV7 and DIV14. Evaluation of Ca2+ homeostasis perturbation caused by 22q11.2 deletion using calcium imaging revealed a significantly lower amplitude of calcium elevation and a smaller area under the curve after depolarization in neurons from Df(16)A +/- mice at both DIV7 and DIV14. Furthermore, the properties of inhibitory synaptic events were significantly altered in Df(16)A +/- mice. We identified changes in mRNA expression profiles, especially in ion channels, receptors, and transporters that may underlie the neurophysiological effects of this mutation.

This increased cross-frequency coupling is observed specifically when the mice successfully perform a spatial working memory task.

Df(16)A+/- mice have normal balance between E/I at baseline but are unable to maintain it upon dopaminergic challenge. Specifically, in wild-type mice, D1 receptor (D1R) activation enhances excitability of layer V prefrontal pyramidal neurons and D2 receptor (D2R) activation reduces it. Whereas the excitatory effect upon D1R activation is enhanced in Df(16)A+/- mice, the inhibitory effect upon D2R activation is reduced. The latter is partly due to the inability of mutant mice to activate GABAergic parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons through D2Rs. We further demonstrate that reduced KCNQ2 channel function in PV+ interneurons in Df(16)A+/- mice renders them less capable of inhibiting pyramidal neurons upon D2 modulation.

Although cortical layering, cytoarchitecture, and proteome were found to be largely unaffected, electrophysiological examination of the mPFC revealed both neuronal hyperexcitability and alterations in short-term synaptic plasticity consistent with enhanced neurotransmitter release. Increased excitability of layer II/III pyramidal neurons was accompanied by consistent reductions in voltage-activated potassium currents near the action potential threshold as well as by enhanced recruitment of inputs arising from superficial layers to layer V. We further observed reductions in both the paired-pulse ratios and the enhanced short-term depression of layer V synapses arising from superficial layers consistent with enhanced neurotransmitter release at these synapses. Recordings from layer II/III pyramidal neurons revealed action potential widening that could account for enhanced neurotransmitter release. Significantly, we found that reduced functional expression of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit Kv1.1 substantially contributes to both the excitability and short-term plasticity alterations that we observed. The underlying dysregulation of Kv1.1 expression was attributable to cAMP elevations in the PFC secondary to reduced phosphodiesterase 4 activity present in Disc1 deficiency and was rescued by pharmacological blockade of adenylate cyclase. Our results demonstrate a potentially devastating impact of Disc1 deficiency on neural circuit function, partly due to Kv1.1 dysregulation that leads to a dual dysfunction consisting of enhanced neuronal excitability and altered short-term synaptic plasticity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Schizophrenia is a profoundly disabling psychiatric illness with a devastating impact not only upon the afflicted but also upon their families and the broader society. Although the underlying causes of schizophrenia remain poorly understood, a growing body of studies has identified and strongly implicated various specific risk genes in schizophrenia pathogenesis.

The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which results in deficient activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, is associated with clinical features of schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of this polymorphism on Prepulse Inhibition (PPI), a translational model of sensorimotor gating which is disrupted in schizophrenia. We utilized humanized BDNFVal66Met (hBDNFVal66Met) mice which have been modified to carry the Val66Met polymorphism, as well as express humanized BDNF in vivo. We also studied the long-term effect of chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure in these animals as a model of history of stress. PPI was assessed at 30ms and 100ms interstimulus intervals (ISI). Analysis of PPI at the commonly used 100ms ISI identified that, irrespective of CORT treatment, the hBDNFVal/Met genotype was associated with significantly reduced PPI. In contrast, PPI was not different between hBDNFMet/Met and hBDNFVal/Val genotype mice. At the 30ms ISI, CORT treatment selectively disrupted sensorimotor gating of hBDNFVal/Met heterozygote mice but not hBDNFVal/Val or hBDNFMet/Met mice. Analysis of startle reactivity revealed that chronic CORT reduced startle reactivity of hBDNFVal/Val male mice by 51%. However, this was independent of the effect of CORT on PPI. In summary, we provide evidence of a distinct BDNFVal66Met heterozygote-specific phenotype using the sensorimotor gating endophenotype of schizophrenia.

Since this mouse strain is widely and commercially available, we propose it as an amenable tool to study DISC1-related biochemical alterations and psychiatric behaviors.", "Keywords": ["129 strain", "DISC1", "forced swim test", "mouse model", "pre-pulse inhibition", "tail suspension test"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Raquel", "Last Name": "G\u00f3mez-Sintes", "Affiliation": "Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular \"Severo Ochoa\", (CBMSO) CSIC/UAM Madrid, Spain ; Networking Research Center on Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Instituto de Salud Carlos III Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Mirna", "Last Name": "Kvajo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Gogos", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 J", "Last Name": "Lucas", "Affiliation": "Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular \"Severo Ochoa\", (CBMSO) CSIC/UAM Madrid, Spain ; Networking Research Center on Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Instituto de Salud Carlos III Madrid, Spain."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24853937", "Title": "Loss-of-function variants in schizophrenia risk and SETD1A as a candidate susceptibility gene.", "Abstract": "Loss-of-function (LOF) (i.e., nonsense, splice site, and frameshift) variants that lead to disruption of gene function are likely to contribute to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Using two independent whole-exome sequencing family datasets and a follow-up autism spectrum disorder (ASD) case/control whole-exome sequencing dataset, we identified variants in one gene, Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), as being associated with both SCZ and ASD. FAN1 is located in a region on chromosome 15q13.3 implicated by a recurrent copy number variant, which predisposes to an array of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In both SCZ and ASD datasets, rare nonsynonymous risk variants cluster significantly in affected individuals within a 20-kb window that spans several key functional domains of the gene.

The nature of genetic variation underlying linkage peaks in psychiatric disorders remains largely unknown and both rare and common variants may be contributing. Here, we examine the contribution of common variants located under the 13q32-34 linkage region. We used densely spaced SNPs to fine map the linkage peak region using both a discovery sample of 415 families and a meta-analysis incorporating two additional replication family samples. In a second phase of the study, we use one family-based data set with 237 families and independent case-control data sets for fine mapping of the common variant association signal using HapMap SNPs. We report a significant association with a genetic variant (rs9583277) within the gene encoding for the myosin heavy-chain Myr 8 (MYO16), which has been implicated in neuronal phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. Follow-up analysis of HapMap variation within MYO16 in a second set of Afrikaner families and additional case-control data sets of European descent highlighted a region across introns 2-6 as the most likely region to harbor common MYO16 risk variants.

Guided by cognitive deficits, we demonstrated that mutant mice display robust deficits in high-frequency synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity (synaptic depression and potentiation), as well as alterations in long-term plasticity and dendritic spine stability. Apart from previously reported reduction in dendritic complexity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, altered synaptic plasticity occurs in the context of relatively circumscribed and often subtle cytoarchitectural changes in neuronal density and inhibitory neuron numbers. We confirmed the pronounced DiGeorge critical region 8 (Dgcr8)-dependent deficits in primary micro-RNA processing and identified additional changes in gene expression and RNA splicing that may underlie the effects of this mutation. Reduction in Dgcr8 levels appears to be a major driver of altered short-term synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex and working memory but not of long-term plasticity and cytoarchitecture.
