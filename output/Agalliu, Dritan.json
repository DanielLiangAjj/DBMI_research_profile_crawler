In vitro modeling of the human BBB is limited by the lack of robust protocols to generate BMECs from human iPSCs (hiPSCs). Here, we report generation of reprogrammed BMECs (rBMECs) through combining hiPSC differentiation into BBB-primed endothelial cells (bpECs) and reprogramming with two BBB transcription factors, FOXF2 and ZIC3. rBMECs express a subset of the BBB gene repertoire including tight junctions and transporters, exhibit higher paracellular barrier properties, lower caveolar-mediated transcytosis, and equivalent p-glycoprotein activity compared to primary HBMECs, and can be activated by oligomeric A\u03b242. We then generated an hiPSC-derived 3D neurovascular system that incorporates rBMECs, pericytes, and astrocytes using the MIMETAS platform. This novel 3D system closely resembles the in vivo BBB at structural and functional levels and can be used to study pathogenic mechanisms of neurological diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronak", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aomeng", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Bosco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ugur", "Last Name": "Akcan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Richters", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paula Barrilero", "Last Name": "Delgado", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dritan", "Last Name": "Agalliu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr05"}, {"PMID": "38599212", "Title": "Glutamatergic neuronal activity regulates angiogenesis and blood-retinal barrier maturation via Norrin/\u03b2-catenin signaling.", "Abstract": "Interactions among neuronal, glial, and vascular components are crucial for retinal angiogenesis and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) maturation.

To address this issue, longitudinal analysis of Toxoplasma gondii dissemination in the brain was conducted using 2-photon imaging through a cranial window in living mice that transgenically express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-claudin-5. Extracellular T. gondii parasites were observed migrating slowly (1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28\u2009\u03bcm/min) and with low displacement within the brain. In contrast, a population of highly motile infected cells transported vacuoles of T. gondii significantly faster (6.30\u2009\u00b1\u20093.09\u2009\u03bcm/min) and with a higher displacement than free parasites. Detailed analysis of microglial dynamics using CX3CR1-GFP mice revealed that T. gondii-infected microglia remained stationary, and infection did not increase the extension/retraction of microglial processes. The role of infiltrating immune cells in shuttling T. gondii was examined by labeling of peripheral hematopoietic cells with anti-CD45 antibody. Infected CD45+ cells were found crawling along the CNS vessel walls and trafficked T. gondii within the brain parenchyma at significantly higher speeds (3.35\u2009\u00b1\u20091.70\u2009\u03bcm/min) than extracellular tachyzoites. Collectively, these findings highlight a dual role for immune cells in neuroprotection and in facilitating parasite dissemination within the brain. IMPORTANCE T. gondii is a foodborne parasite that infects the brain and can cause fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. However, there is a limited understanding of how the parasites disseminate through the brain and evade immune clearance. We utilized intravital imaging to visualize extracellular T. gondii tachyzoites and infected cells migrating within the infected mouse brain during acute infection. The infection of motile immune cells infiltrating the brain from the periphery significantly increased the dissemination of T. gondii in the brain compared to that of free parasites migrating using their own motility: the speed and displacement of these infected cells would enable them to cover nearly 1\u2009cm of distance per day! Among the infiltrating cells, T. gondii predominantly infected monocytes and CD8+ T cells, indicating that the parasite can hijack immune cells that are critical for controlling the infection in order to enhance their dissemination within the brain.", "Keywords": ["Toxoplasma", "central nervous system infections", "host-pathogen interactions", "immunity", "parasite", "pathogenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Toxoplasma", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Brain", "Central Nervous System", "Monocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "University of California Irvine, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Irvine, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dario X", "Last Name": "Figueroa Velez", "Affiliation": "University of California Irvine, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Irvine, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie B", "Last Name": "Orchanian", "Affiliation": "University of California Irvine, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Irvine, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lindsey A", "Last Name": "Shallberg", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvaniagrid.25879.31 School of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Pathobiology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dritan", "Last Name": "Agalliu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Hunter", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvaniagrid.25879.31 School of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Pathobiology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sunil P", "Last Name": "Gandhi", "Affiliation": "University of California Irvine, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Irvine, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa B", "Last Name": "Lodoen", "Affiliation": "University of California Irvine, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Irvine, California, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2022Dec20"}, {"PMID": "36219800", "Title": "Reader Response: Lack of Association of Group A Streptococcal Infections and Onset of Tics: European Multicenter Tics in Children Study.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Streptococcal Infections", "Tic Disorders", "Tics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rajat", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "(Birmingham, UK)."}, {"First Name": "Dritan", "Last Name": "Agalliu", "Affiliation": "(New York)."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Spalice", "Affiliation": "(Rome)."}, {"First Name": "Herbert M", "Last Name": "Lachman", "Affiliation": "(New York)."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Ubhi", "Affiliation": "(Darlington, UK)."}, {"First Name": "Kiki", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "(Birmingham, UK)."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Frankovich", "Affiliation": "(Palo Alto, CA)."}, {"First Name": "Anders", "Last Name": "Fasth", "Affiliation": "(Gothenburg, Sweden)."}, {"First Name": "Mats", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "(Gothenburg, Sweden)."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Fernell", "Affiliation": "(Gothenburg, Sweden)."}, {"First Name": "Ida", "Last Name": "Walles", "Affiliation": "(Uppsala, Sweden)."}, {"First Name": "Susanne", "Last Name": "Bejerot", "Affiliation": "(\u00d6rebro, Sweden)."}, {"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "van der Spek", "Affiliation": "(Rotterdam, Netherlands)."}, {"First Name": "Janet L", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "(Uppsala, Sweden)."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2022Sep06"}, {"PMID": "36098369", "Title": "Mural Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling regulates Lama2 expression to promote neurovascular unit maturation.", "Abstract": "Neurovascular unit and barrier maturation rely on vascular basement membrane (vBM) composition.

Bulk RNA sequencing and validation using postnatal day 10 and 14 wild-type versus adenomatosis polyposis coli downregulated 1 (Apcdd1-/-) mouse retinas revealed that Lama2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in mutant vasculature with higher Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Mural cells are the main source of Lama2, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation induces Lama2 expression in mural cells in vitro. Markers of mature astrocytes, including aquaporin 4 (a water channel in astrocyte endfeet) and integrin-\u03b16 (a laminin receptor), are upregulated in Apcdd1-/- retinas with higher Lama2 vBM deposition. Thus, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway regulates Lama2 expression in mural cells to promote neurovascular unit and barrier maturation.", "Keywords": ["Blood\u2013retinal barrier", "Canonical Wnt signaling", "Laminin", "Mural cell", "Retina", "Vascular basement membrane"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Wnt Signaling Pathway", "beta Catenin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Saptarshi", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sanjid", "Last Name": "Shahriar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Giangreco", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Panos", "Last Name": "Arvanitis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "Winkler", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t, Munich 80336, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Brunken", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tyler", "Last Name": "Cutforth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dritan", "Last Name": "Agalliu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2022Sep01"}, {"PMID": "35246514", "Title": "Endothelial Unc5B controls blood-brain barrier integrity.", "Abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is critical for proper function of the central nervous system (CNS).

In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

vascular fate.", "Abstract": "Cells derived from pluripotent sources in vitro must resemble those found in vivo as closely as possible at both transcriptional and functional levels in order to be a useful tool for studying diseases and developing therapeutics. Recently, differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) with blood-brain barrier (BBB)-like properties has been reported. These cells have since been used as a robust in vitro BBB model for drug delivery and mechanistic understanding of neurological diseases. However, the precise cellular identity of these induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) has not been well described. Employing a comprehensive transcriptomic metaanalysis of previously published hPSC-derived cells validated by physiological assays, we demonstrate that iBMECs lack functional attributes of ECs since they are deficient in vascular lineage genes while expressing clusters of genes related to the neuroectodermal epithelial lineage (Epi-iBMEC). Overexpression of key endothelial ETS transcription factors (ETV2, ERG, and FLI1) reprograms Epi-iBMECs into authentic endothelial cells that are congruent with bona fide endothelium at both transcriptomic as well as some functional levels.

Therefore, preventing them is of utmost clinical relevance, and prophylactic treatments are perhaps the most efficient strategy. Here, we show that systemic prophylactic administration of a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist, CpG-C, is effective against brain metastases. Acute and chronic systemic administration of CpG-C reduced tumor cell seeding and growth in the brain in three tumor models in mice, including metastasis of human and mouse lung cancer, and spontaneous melanoma-derived brain metastasis. Studying mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of CpG-C, we found that in the brain, unlike in the periphery, natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes are not involved in controlling metastasis. Next, we demonstrated that the systemically administered CpG-C is taken up by endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, without affecting blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and tumor brain extravasation. In vitro assays pointed to microglia, but not astrocytes, as mediators of CpG- C effects through increased tumor killing and phagocytosis, mediated by direct microglia-tumor contact. In vivo, CpG-C-activated microglia displayed elevated mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-inducing and phagocytosis-related genes. Intravital imaging showed that CpG-C-activated microglia cells contact, kill, and phagocytize tumor cells in the early stages of tumor brain invasion more than nonactivated microglia. Blocking in vivo activation of microglia with minocycline, and depletion of microglia with a colony-stimulating factor 1 inhibitor, indicated that microglia mediate the antitumor effects of CpG-C.

Similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who display a high number of T cells in the brain attacking oligodendrocytes, PD patients show higher numbers of T cells in the ventral midbrain than healthy, age-matched controls. Mouse models of the disease also show the presence of T cells in the brain. The role of these infiltrating T cells in the propagation of disease is controversial; however, recent studies indicate that they may be autoreactive in nature, recognizing disease-altered self-proteins as foreign antigens. T cells of PD patients can generate an autoimmune response to \u03b1-synuclein, a protein that is aggregated in PD. \u03b1-Synuclein and other proteins are post-translationally modified in an environment in which protein processing is altered, possibly leading to the generation of neo-epitopes, or self-peptides that have not been identified by the host immune system as non-foreign. Infiltrating T cells may also be responding to such modified proteins. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown associations of PD with haplotypes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, and a polymorphism in a non-coding region that may increase MHC class II in PD patients.

Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) migrated away from arteries along existing capillaries and reassembled into collateral arteries, which we termed \"artery reassembly\".

In the past decade, there has been considerable progress in understanding not only the molecular pathways involved in BBB development, but also BBB breakdown in neurological diseases. Specifically, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog pathways moved into the focus of BBB research. Moreover, angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling that is linked to angiogenic processes has gained attention in the BBB field. Blood vessels play an essential role in initiation and progression of many diseases, including inflammation outside the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the potential influence of CNS blood vessels in neurological diseases associated with BBB alterations or neuroinflammation has become a major focus of current research to understand their contribution to pathogenesis. Moreover, the BBB remains a major obstacle to pharmaceutical intervention in the CNS. The complications may either be expressed by inadequate therapeutic delivery like in brain tumours, or by poor delivery of the drug across the BBB and ineffective bioavailability. In this review, we initially describe the cellular and molecular components that contribute to the steady state of the healthy BBB. We then discuss BBB alterations in ischaemic stroke, primary and metastatic brain tumour, chronic inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. Throughout the review, we highlight common mechanisms of BBB abnormalities among these diseases, in particular the contribution of neuroinflammation to BBB dysfunction and disease progression, and emphasise unique aspects of BBB alteration in certain diseases such as brain tumours. Moreover, this review highlights novel strategies to monitor BBB function by non-invasive imaging techniques focussing on ischaemic stroke, as well as novel ways to modulate BBB permeability and function to promote treatment of brain tumours, inflammation and Alzheimer's disease.

Inflammatory and postinfectious autoimmune presentations of PANS occur frequently, with some clinical series documenting immune abnormalities in 75%-80% of patients. Thus, comprehensive treatment protocols must include immunological interventions, but their use should be reserved only for PANS cases in which the symptoms represent underlying neuroinflammation or postinfectious autoimmunity, as seen in the PANDAS subgroup (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders associated with Streptococcal infections). Methods: The PANS Research Consortium (PRC) immunomodulatory task force is comprised of immunologists, rheumatologists, neurologists, infectious disease experts, general pediatricians, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, and basic scientists with expertise in neuroimmunology and PANS-related animal models. Preliminary treatment guidelines were created in the Spring of 2014 at the National Institute of Health and refined over the ensuing 2 years over conference calls and a shared web-based document. Seven pediatric mental health practitioners, with expertise in diagnosing and monitoring patients with PANS, were consulted to create categories in disease severity and critically review final recommendations. All authors played a role in creating these guidelines. The views of all authors were incorporated and all authors gave final approval of these guidelines. Results: Separate guidelines were created for the use of immunomodulatory therapies in PANS patients with (1) mild, (2) moderate-to-severe, and (3) extreme/life-threatening severity. For mildly impairing PANS, the most appropriate therapy may be \"tincture of time\" combined with cognitive behavioral therapy and other supportive therapies. If symptoms persist, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or short oral corticosteroid bursts are recommended. For moderate-to-severe PANS, oral or intravenous corticosteroids may be sufficient. However, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is often the preferred treatment for these patients by most PRC members. For more severe or chronic presentations, prolonged corticosteroid courses (with taper) or repeated high-dose corticosteroids may be indicated. For PANS with extreme and life-threatening impairment, therapeutic plasma exchange is the first-line therapy given either alone or in combination with IVIG, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, and/or rituximab. Conclusions: These recommendations will help guide the use of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy in the treatment of PANS.", "Keywords": ["IVIG", "NSAIDs", "PANDAS", "PANS",

There is an urgent need for new therapies to protect and restore BBB function, either by strengthening endothelial tight junctions or suppressing endothelial vesicular transcytosis. Although wingless integrated MMTV (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays an essential role in BBB formation and maintenance in healthy CNS, its role in BBB repair in neurologic diseases such as MS remains unclear. Using a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin reporter mouse and several downstream targets, we demonstrate that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is up-regulated in CNS endothelial cells in both human MS and the mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in CNS blood vessels during EAE progression correlates with up-regulation of neuronal Wnt3 expression, as well as breakdown of endothelial cell junctions. Genetic inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in CNS endothelium before disease onset exacerbates the clinical presentation of EAE, CD4+ T-cell infiltration into the CNS, and demyelination by increasing expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and the transcytosis protein Caveolin-1 and promoting endothelial transcytosis. However, Wnt signaling attenuation does not affect the progressive degradation of tight junction proteins or paracellular BBB leakage.

We have previously shown that GAS infection in mouse models induces a robust Th17 response in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). Here, we identified GAS-specific Th17 cells in tonsils of humans naturally exposed to GAS, prompting us to explore whether GAS-specific CD4+ T cells home to mouse brains following i.n. infection. Intranasal challenge of repeatedly GAS-inoculated mice promoted migration of GAS-specific Th17 cells from NALT into the brain, BBB breakdown, serum IgG deposition, microglial activation, and loss of excitatory synaptic proteins under conditions in which no viable bacteria were detected in CNS tissue. CD4+ T cells were predominantly located in the olfactory bulb (OB) and in other brain regions that receive direct input from the OB.

Within the central nervous system (CNS), angiogenesis and acquisition of blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties by endothelial cells is essential for CNS function. However, the role of angiogenesis in CNS pathologies associated with impaired barrier function remains unclear. Although vessel abnormalities characterized by abnormal barrier function are well documented in multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the CNS resulting from an immune cell attack on oligodendrocytes, histological analysis of human MS samples has shown that angiogenesis is prevalent in and around the demyelinating plaques. Experiments using an animal model that mimics several features of human MS, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), have confirmed these human pathological findings and shed new light on the contribution of pre-symptomatic angiogenesis to disease progression. The CNS-infiltrating inflammatory cells that are a hallmark of both MS and EAE secrete several factors that not only contribute to exacerbating the inflammatory process but also promote and stimulate angiogenesis. Moreover, chemical or biological inhibitors that directly or indirectly block angiogenesis provide clinical benefits for disease progression.
