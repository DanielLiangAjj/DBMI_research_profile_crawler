From childhood lessons in community care to transformative experiences in Canada and prestigious mentorships, her leadership at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian has fostered innovative initiatives addressing maternal health. Philanthropy plays a pivotal role in realizing her vision, including mental health integration within women's health care. International reach, exemplified by a successful fellowship program with Ireland, underscores her commitment to collaboration Dr. D'Alton's reflections illuminate the transformative power of teamwork, mentorship, and innovation in advancing women's health worldwide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["New York City", "Humans", "Obstetrics", "Gynecology", "Ireland", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Female"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "D'Alton", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Columbia University, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Clinical obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2024Jun01"}, {"PMID": "37944152", "Title": "Risk Factors, Trends, and Outcomes Associated With Postpartum Sepsis Readmissions.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence, timing, clinical risk factors, and adverse outcomes associated with postpartum readmissions for maternal sepsis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Female", "United States", "Humans", "Puerperal Infection", "Patient Readmission", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Hospitalization", "Postpartum Period", "Sepsis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lilly Y", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; and the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Uma M", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mirella", "Last Name": "Mourad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dena", "Last Name": "Goffman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Nathan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Ju", "Last Name": "Sheen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "D'Alton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2024Mar01"}, {"PMID": "36897136", "Title": "Deliveries Among Patients With Maternal Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States, 2000-2019.", "Abstract": "To assess clinical characteristics, trends, and outcomes associated with the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during pregnancy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "United States", "Hepacivirus", "Premature Birth", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Hepatitis C", "Parturition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brittany", "Last Name": "Arditi", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Jordan", "Last Name": "Emont", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "D'Alton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2023Apr01"}, {"PMID": "36846477", "Title": "How do people with chronic pain choose their music for pain management? Examining the external validity of the cognitive vitality model.", "Abstract": "Music interventions for pain are more successful when patients choose the music themselves. But little is known about the attentional strategies used by chronic pain patients when choosing or using music for pain management, and the degree to which these attentional strategies align with the cognitive mechanisms outlines in the cognitive vitality model (CVM, a recently developed theoretical framework that outlines five cognitive mechanisms that mediate the analgesic effects of music for pain management). To investigate this question, we used a sequential explanatory mixed method approach, which included a survey, online music listening experiment, and qualitative data collection, with chronic pain patients (n=70). First, we asked chronic pain patients to name a piece of music that they would use to manage their chronic pain, and answer 19 questions about why they chose that particular piece of music using a questionnaire based on the CVM. Next, we asked chronic pain patients to listen to high energy and low energy pieces of music, to understand aesthetic music preferences and emotional responses at the group level. Finally, participants were asked to qualitatively tell us how they used music to manage their pain. Factor Analysis was completed on the survey data, and identified a five-factor structure in participant responses that was consistent with five mechanisms identified in the CVM. Regression analysis indicated that chronic pain patients choose music for pain management if they think it will facilitate Musical Integration and Cognitive Agency. Musical Integration refers to the degree to which the music can provide an immersive and absorbing experience. Cognitive Agency refers to having an increased feeling of control. At the group level, participants reported a preference for low energy music, and reported that they found high energy music more irritating. However, is it important to note that individual people had different music preferences. Thematic synthesis of patient responses highlighted how these processes mediate the analgesic benefits of music listening from the perspective of chronic pain patients, and highlighted the wide range of music used by participants for chronic pain management including electronic dance music, heavy metal and Beethoven. These findings demonstrate that chronic pain patients use specific attentional strategies when using music for pain management, and these strategies align with the cognitive vitality model.", "Keywords": ["chronic pain", "cognitive mechanisms", "music", "music listening", "pain", "psychology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Howlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Experimental Psychology, School of Biological and Experimental Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Rosemary", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "Psychology Department, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "D'Alton", "Affiliation": "Psychology Department, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Brendan", "Last Name": "Rooney", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36201759", "Title": "Trends in and Outcomes of Deliveries Complicated by Cystic Fibrosis.", "Abstract": "To characterize current trends and outcomes in pregnancies complicated by cystic fibrosis (CF) that resulted in delivery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pregnancy", "Infant, Newborn", "Female", "Pregnancy Complications", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Obstetric Labor Complications", "Premature Birth", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christina N", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California;
