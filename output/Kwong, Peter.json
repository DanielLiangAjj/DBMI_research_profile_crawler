To gain insight into the prevalent induction of these antibodies, we isolated and characterized 11 V2 apex-directed neutralizing antibody lineages from SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. Remarkably, all SHIV-induced V2 apex lineages were derived from reading frame two of the rhesus DH3-15*01 gene. Cryo-EM structures of envelope trimers in complex with antibodies from nine rhesus lineages revealed modes of recognition that mimicked three canonical human V2 apex-recognition modes. Notably, amino acids encoded by DH3-15*01 played divergent structural roles, inserting into a hole at the trimer apex, H-bonding to an exposed strand, or forming part of a loop scaffold. Overall, we identify a DH3-15*01-signature for rhesus V2 apex broadly neutralizing antibodies and show that highly selected genetic elements can play multiple roles in antigen recognition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan S", "Last Name": "Roark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rumi", "Last Name": "Habib", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew Jesse", "Last Name": "Connell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mattia", "Last Name": "Bonsignori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Hogarty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kirsten", "Last Name": "Sowers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frederic", "Last Name": "Bibollet-Ruche", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Callaghan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Carey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darcy R", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wanting", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosemarie D", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Younghoon", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juliette M", "Last Name": "Rando", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Wolff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Q Paula", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raiees", "Last Name": "Andrabi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin O", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Seaman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel W", "Last Name": "Kulp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Roederer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beatrice H", "Last Name": "Hahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun12"}, {"PMID": "38873606", "Title": "Anti-idiotype isolation of a broad and potent influenza A virus-neutralizing human antibody.", "Abstract": "The VH6-1 class of antibodies includes some of the broadest and most potent antibodies that neutralize influenza A virus.

Here, we evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of one or two doses of a live-attenuated murine pneumonia virus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein (MPV/S-2P), delivered intranasally/intratracheally to male rhesus macaques. A single dose of MPV/S-2P is highly immunogenic, and a second dose increases the magnitude and breadth of the mucosal and systemic anti-S antibody responses and increases levels of dimeric anti-S IgA in the airways. MPV/S-2P also induces S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in the airways that differentiate into large populations of tissue-resident memory cells within a month after the boost. One dose induces substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and two doses of MPV/S-2P are fully protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus replication in the airways. A prime/boost immunization with a mucosally-administered live-attenuated MPV vector could thus be highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

neutralizing mAbs 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDBroadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) represent a promising strategy for HIV-1 immunoprophylaxis and treatment. 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS are bNAbs that target the highly conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 viral envelope glycoprotein, respectively.METHODSIn this phase 1, open-label trial, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of 5 mg/kg 10E8VLS administered alone, or concurrently with 5 mg/kg VRC07-523LS, via s.c. injection to healthy non-HIV-infected individuals.RESULTSEight participants received either 10E8VLS alone (n = 6) or 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS in combination (n = 2). Five (n = 5 of 8, 62.5%) participants who received 10E8VLS experienced moderate local reactogenicity, and 1 participant (n = 1/8, 12.5%) experienced severe local reactogenicity. Further trial enrollment was stopped, and no participant received repeat dosing. All local reactogenicity resolved without sequelae. 10E8VLS retained its neutralizing capacity, and no functional anti-drug antibodies were detected; however, a serum t1/2 of 8.1 days was shorter than expected. Therefore, the trial was voluntarily stopped per sponsor decision (Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], NIH). Mechanistic studies performed to investigate the underlying reason for the reactogenicity suggest that multiple mechanisms may have contributed, including antibody aggregation and upregulation of local inflammatory markers.CONCLUSION10E8VLS resulted in unexpected reactogenicity and a shorter t1/2 in comparison with previously tested bNAbs. These studies may facilitate identification of nonreactogenic second-generation MPER-targeting bNAbs, which could be an effective strategy for HIV-1 immunoprophylaxis and treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov, accession no.

infections in people with immunocompromising conditions1-4, but the evolutionary processes underlying these observations are incompletely understood. Here we used high-throughput, single-genome amplification and sequencing (HT-SGS) to obtain up to ~103 SARS-CoV-2 spike gene sequences in each of 184 respiratory samples from 22 people with HIV (PWH) and 25 people without HIV (PWOH). Twelve of 22 PWH had advanced HIV infection, defined by peripheral blood CD4 T cell counts (i.e., CD4 counts) <200 cells/\u03bcL. In PWOH and PWH with CD4 counts \u2265200 cells/\u03bcL, most single-genome spike sequences in each person matched one haplotype that predominated throughout the infection. By contrast, people with advanced HIV showed elevated intra-host spike diversity with a median of 46 haplotypes per person (IQR 14-114). Higher intra-host spike diversity immediately after COVID-19 symptom onset predicted longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding among PWH, and intra-host spike diversity at this timepoint was significantly higher in people with advanced HIV than in PWOH. Composition of spike sequence populations in people with advanced HIV fluctuated rapidly over time, with founder sequences often replaced by groups of new haplotypes. These population-level changes were associated with a high total burden of intra-host mutations and positive selection at functionally important residues. In several cases, delayed emergence of detectable serum binding to spike was associated with positive selection for presumptive antibody-escape mutations. Taken together, our findings show remarkable intra-host genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in advanced HIV infection and suggest that adaptive intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution in this setting may contribute to the emergence of new variants of concern (VOCs).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sung Hee", "Last Name": "Ko", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pierce", "Last Name": "Radecki", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frida", "Last Name": "Belinky", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinal N", "Last Name": "Bhiman", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Meiring", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jackie", "Last Name": "Kleynhans", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Amoako", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "Guerra Canedo", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Lucas", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dikeledi", "Last Name": "Kekana", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Martinson", "Affiliation": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Limakatso", "Last Name": "Lebina", "Affiliation": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Josie", "Last Name": "Everatt", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Tempia", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Tatsiana", "Last Name": "Bylund", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Wolter", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "von Gottberg", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Eli A", "Last Name": "Boritz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan06"}, {"PMID": "38250850", "Title": "Extraordinary Titer and Broad Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Induced by Stabilized RBD Nanoparticles from Strain BA.5.", "Abstract": "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and a key component of licensed vaccines. Substantial mutations in RBD, however, enable current variants to escape immunogenicity generated by vaccination with the ancestral (WA1) strain.

We observed both WA1- and BA.5-RBD nanoparticles to degrade substantially after a few days at 37 \u00b0C. Incorporation of nine RBD-stabilizing mutations, however, increased yield ~five-fold and stability such that more than 50% of either the WA1- or BA.5-RBD nanoparticle was retained after one week at 37 \u00b0C. Murine immunizations revealed that the stabilized RBD-nanoparticles induced ~100-fold higher autologous neutralization titers than the prefusion-stabilized (S2P) spike at a 2 \u03bcg dose. Even at a 25-fold lower dose where S2P-induced neutralization titers were below the detection limit, the stabilized BA.5-RBD nanoparticle induced homologous titers of 12,795 ID50 and heterologous titers against WA1 of 1767 ID50.

facilitate immune evasion. Single-molecule FRET using peptides for Env labeling revealed structural dynamics of Env, but peptide use risks potential effects on structural integrity/dynamics. While incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into Env by amber stop-codon suppression, followed by click chemistry, offers a minimally invasive approach, this has proved to be technically challenging for HIV-1. Here, we develope an intact amber-free HIV-1 system that overcomes hurdles of preexisting viral amber codons. We achieved dual-ncAA incorporation into Env on amber-free virions, enabling single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies of click-labeled Env that validated the previous peptide-based labeling approaches by confirming the intrinsic propensity of Env to dynamically sample multiple conformational states. Amber-free click-labeled Env also enabled real-time tracking of single virion internalization and trafficking in cells.

Here, we evaluated the ability of a human FP-directed bNAb, VRC34.01, along with two vaccine-elicited anti-FP rhesus macaque mAbs, DFPH-a.15 and DF1W-a.01, to protect against simian-HIV (SHIV)BG505 challenge. VRC34.01 neutralized SHIVBG505 with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.58 \u03bcg/ml, whereas DF1W-a.01 and DFPH-a.15 were 4- or 30-fold less potent, respectively. VRC34.01 was infused into four rhesus macaques at a dose of 10 mg/kg and four rhesus macaques at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. The animals were intrarectally challenged 5 days later with SHIVBG505. In comparison with all 12 control animals that became infected, all four animals infused with VRC34.01 (10 mg/kg) and three out of four animals infused with VRC34.01 (2.5 mg/kg) remained uninfected. Because of the lower potency of DF1W-a.01 and DFPH-a.15 against SHIVBG505, we infused both Abs at a higher dose of 100 mg/kg into four rhesus macaques each, followed by SHIVBG505 challenge 5 days later. Three of four animals that received DF1W-a.01 were protected against infection, whereas all animals that received DFPH-a.15 were protected. Overall, the protective serum neutralization titers observed in these animals were similar to what has been observed for other bNAbs in similar SHIV infection models and in human clinical trials. In conclusion, FP-directed mAbs can thus provide dose-dependent in vivo protection against mucosal SHIV challenges, supporting the development of prophylactic vaccines targeting the HIV-1 Env FP.",

traditionally endemic areas in West Africa, posing a pandemic biothreat. LASV-neutralizing antibodies, moreover, have proven difficult to elicit. To gain insight into LASV neutralization, here we develop a prefusion-stabilized LASV glycoprotein trimer (GPC), pan it against phage libraries comprising single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) from shark and camel, and identify one, D5, which neutralizes LASV. Cryo-EM analyses reveal D5 to recognize a cleavage-dependent site-of-vulnerability at the trimer apex. The recognized site appears specific to GPC intermediates, with protomers lacking full\u00a0cleavage between GP1 and GP2 subunits. Guinea pig immunizations with the prefusion-stabilized cleavage-intermediate LASV GPC, first as trimer and then as a nanoparticle, induce neutralizing responses, targeting multiple epitopes including that of D5; we identify a neutralizing antibody (GP23) from the immunized guinea pigs. Collectively, our findings define a prefusion-stabilized GPC trimer, reveal an apex-situated site-of-vulnerability, and demonstrate elicitation of LASV-neutralizing responses by a

in non-human primates.", "Abstract": "As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue evolving, testing updated vaccines in non-human primates remains important for guiding human clinical practice. To date, such studies have focused on antibody titers and antigen-specific B and T cell frequencies. Here, we extend our understanding by integrating innate and adaptive immune responses to mRNA-1273 vaccination in rhesus macaques. We sorted innate immune cells from a pre-vaccine time point, as well as innate immune cells and antigen-specific peripheral B and T cells two weeks after each of two vaccine doses and used single-cell sequencing to assess the transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptors of each cell. We show that a subset of S-specific T cells expresses cytokines critical for activating innate responses, with a concomitant increase in CCR5-expressing intermediate monocytes and a shift of natural killer cells to a more cytotoxic phenotype.

Currently there is no H7N9-specific prevention or treatment for humans. From a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case occurred in Hong Kong, we isolated four H7 hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by single B cell cloning, with three mAbs directed to the HA globular head domain (HA1) and one to the HA stem region (HA2). Two clonally related HA1-directed mAbs, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, potently neutralized H7N9 and protected mice from a lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge. Cryo-EM structures revealed that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bind to a \u03b214-centered surface partially overlapping with the antigenic site D of HA1 and disrupt the 220-loop that makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid on the adjacent protomer, thus affectively blocking viral entry. The more potent mAb H7.HK2 retained full HA1 binding and neutralization capacity to later H7N9 isolates from 2016-2017, which is consistent with structural data showing that the antigenic mutations of 2016-2017 from the 2013 H7N9 only occurred at the periphery of the mAb epitope. The HA2-directed mAb H7.HK4 lacked neutralizing activity but protected mice from the lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge when engineered to mouse IgG2a enabling Fc effector function in mice. Used in combination with H7.HK2 at a suboptimal dose, H7.HK4 augmented mouse protection.

Mucosal vaccination has been proposed as a strategy to increase protection at the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing airway immunity, potentially reducing rates of infection and transmission. Here, we compared protection against XBB.1.16 virus challenge 5 months following IM or mucosal boosting in non-human primates (NHP) that had previously received a two-dose mRNA-1273 primary vaccine regimen. The mucosal boost was composed of a bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine encoding for both SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) and delivered either by an intranasal mist or an inhaled aerosol. An additional group of animals was boosted by the IM route with bivalent WA1/BA.5 spike-matched mRNA (mRNA-1273.222) as a benchmark control. NHP were challenged in the upper and lower airways 18 weeks after boosting with XBB.1.16, a heterologous Omicron lineage strain. Cohorts boosted with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by an aerosolized or intranasal route had low to undetectable virus replication as assessed by levels of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and nose, respectively. In contrast, animals that received the mRNA-1273.222 boost by the IM route showed minimal protection against virus replication in the upper airway but substantial reduction of virus RNA levels in the lower airway. Immune analysis showed that the mucosal vaccines elicited more durable antibody and T cell responses than the IM vaccine. Protection elicited by the aerosolized vaccine was associated with mucosal IgG and IgA responses, whereas protection elicited by intranasal delivery was mediated primarily by mucosal IgA. Thus, durable immunity and effective protection against a highly transmissible heterologous variant in both the upper and lower airways can be achieved by mucosal delivery of a virus-vectored vaccine.

Here, we investigated whether the genetic delivery of eVLPs could achieve strong immune responses in mice as previously reported with the immunization of in vitro purified eVLPs. We utilized Newcastle disease virus-like particles (NDVLPs) to display SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spikes from the WA-1 or Beta variant (S-2P or S-2P\u1d66, respectively) and evaluated neutralizing murine immune responses achieved by a single-gene-transcript DNA construct for the WA-1 or Beta variant (which we named S-2P-NDVLP-1T and S-2P\u1d66-NDVLP-1T, respectively), by multiple-gene-transcript DNA constructs for the Beta variant (S-2P\u1d66-NDVLP-3T), and by a protein subunit-DNA construct for the WA-1 or Beta variant (S-2P-TM or S-2P\u1d66-TM, respectively). The genetic delivery of S-2P-NDVLP-1T or S-2P\u1d66-NDVLP-1T yielded modest neutralizing responses after a single immunization and high neutralizing responses after a second immunization, comparable to previously reported results in mice immunized with in vitro purified S-2P-NDVLPs.

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The closely related Paramyxoviridae family includes parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). These three viral pathogens cause acute respiratory tract infections with substantial disease burden in the young, the elderly, and the immune-compromised. While promising subunit vaccines are being developed with prefusion-stabilized forms of the fusion glycoproteins (Fs) of RSV and PIVs, for which neutralizing titers elicited by the prefusion (pre-F) conformation of F are much higher than for the postfusion (post-F) conformation, with HMPV, pre-F and post-F immunogens described thus far elicit similar neutralizing responses, and it has been unclear which conformation, pre-F or post-F, would be the most effective HMPV F-vaccine immunogen. Here, we investigate the impact of further stabilizing HMPV F in the pre-F state. We replaced the furin-cleavage site with a flexible linker, creating a single chain F that yielded increased amounts of pre-F stabilized trimers, enabling the generation and assessment of F trimers stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds. Introduced prolines could increase both expression yields and antigenic recognition by the pre-F specific antibody, MPE8. The cryo-EM structure of a triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F trimer with the variable region of antibody MPE8 at 3.25-\u00c5 resolution confirmed the formation of designed disulfides and provided structural details on the MPE8 interface. Immunogenicity assessments in na\u00efve mice showed the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F trimer could elicit high titer neutralization, >10-fold higher than elicited by post-F. Immunogenicity assessments in pre-exposed rhesus macaques showed the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F could recall high neutralizing titers after a single immunization, with little discrimination in the recall response between pre-F and post-F immunogens. However, the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F adsorbed HMPV-directed responses from commercially available pooled human immunoglobulin more fully than post-F. Collectively, these results suggest single-chain triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F trimers to be promising HMPV-vaccine antigens.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Metapneumovirus", "Macaca mulatta", "Antibodies", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human", "Antigens, Viral", "Disulfides", "Glycoproteins", "Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Ou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "I-Ting", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Biju", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wing-Pui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Morano", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Erik-Stephane D", "Last Name": "Stancofski", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John-Paul", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shuishu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cheng-Yan", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ruth A", "Last Name": "Woodward", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ursula J", "Last Name": "Buchholz", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2023Sep"}, {"PMID": "37605043", "Title": "Trapping the HIV-1 V3 loop in a helical conformation enables broad neutralization.", "Abstract": "The third variable (V3) loop on the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein trimer is indispensable for virus cell entry.

durable vaccines are needed to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report highly immunogenic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 spike-HBsAg nanoparticles displaying a six-proline-stabilized WA1 (wild type, WT) spike S6P on a HBsAg core. These S6P-HBsAgs bound diverse domain-specific SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. In mice with and without a HBV pre-vaccination, DNA immunization with S6P-HBsAgs elicited significantly more potent and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against diverse SARS-CoV-2 strains than that of soluble S2P or S6P, or full-length S2P with its coding sequence matching mRNA-1273. The nAb responses elicited by S6P-HBsAgs persisted substantially longer than by soluble S2P or S6P and appeared to be enhanced by HBsAg pre-exposure. These data show that genetic delivery of SARS-CoV-2 S6P-HBsAg nanoparticles can elicit greater and more durable nAb responses than non-nanoparticle forms of stabilized spike.

The top designed variants improve neutralization breadth from 39% to 54% at clinically relevant concentrations (IC80\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and improve median potency (IC80) by up to 4-fold over a cross-clade panel of 208 strains. To investigate the mechanisms of improvement, we determine cryoelectron microscopy structures of each variant in complex with the HIV envelope trimer.

We hypothesised that similar potent neutralization could be achieved using F protein targeting aptamers. Aptamers have yet to reach their translational potential for therapeutics or diagnostics due to their short half-life and limited range of target-aptamer interactions; these shortcomings can, however, be ameliorated by application of amino acid-like side chain holding nucleotides. In this study, a stabilized version of the prefusion RSV F protein was targeted by aptamer selection using an oligonucleotide library holding a tryptophan-like side chain. This process resulted in aptamers that bound the F protein with high affinity and differentiated between its\u00a0pre- and postfusion conformation.

To explore the ability of the murine immune system to generate cross-clade neutralizing antibodies and to investigate how higher breadth and potency might be achieved, we tested 17 prime-boost regimens that utilized diverse fusion peptide-carrier conjugates and HIV-1 envelope trimers with different fusion peptides. We observed priming in mice with fusion peptide-carrier conjugates of variable peptide length to elicit higher neutralizing responses, a result we confirmed in guinea pigs. From vaccinated mice, we isolated 21 antibodies, belonging to 4 distinct classes of fusion peptide-directed antibodies capable of cross-clade neutralization. Top antibodies from each class collectively neutralized over 50% of a 208-strain panel. Structural analyses - both X-ray and cryo-EM - revealed each antibody class to recognize a distinct conformation of fusion peptide and to have a binding pocket capable of accommodating diverse fusion peptides. Murine vaccinations can thus elicit diverse neutralizing antibodies, and altering peptide length during prime can improve the elicitation of cross-clade responses targeting the fusion peptide site of HIV-1 vulnerability. IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 fusion peptide has been identified as a site for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies, with prior studies demonstrating that priming with fusion peptide-based immunogens and boosting with soluble envelope (Env) trimers can elicit cross-clade HIV-1-neutralizing responses. To improve the neutralizing breadth and potency of fusion peptide-directed responses, we evaluated vaccine regimens that incorporated diverse fusion peptide-conjugates and Env trimers with variation in fusion peptide length and sequence. We found that variation in peptide length during prime elicits enhanced neutralizing responses in mice and guinea pigs. We identified vaccine-elicited murine monoclonal antibodies from distinct classes capable of cross-clade neutralization and of diverse fusion peptide recognition. Our findings lend insight into improved immunogens and regimens for HIV-1 vaccine development.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1", "X-ray crystallography", "cryo-EM", "fusion peptide", "neutralizing antibody"],

Here, we evaluated the B cell response to H1ssF in healthy adults ages 18 to 70 in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03814720). We observed both a strong plasmablast response and sustained elicitation of cross-reactive HA stem-specific memory B cells after vaccination with H1ssF in individuals of all ages. The B cell response was focused on two conserved epitopes on the H1 stem, with a highly restricted immunoglobulin repertoire unique to each epitope. On average, two-thirds of the B cell and serological antibody response recognized a central epitope on the H1 stem and exhibited broad neutralization across group 1 influenza virus subtypes. The remaining third recognized an epitope near the viral membrane anchor and was largely limited to H1 strains.

Compared to NCI05, NCI09 mediates higher titers of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to gp120-coated cells, as well as higher levels of trogocytosis, a monocyte function that contributes to immune evasion. We also found that passive administration of NCI05 or NCI09 to macaques did not affect the risk of SIVmac251 acquisition compared to controls, demonstrating that these anti-V2 antibodies alone are not protective. However, NCI05 but not NCI09 mucosal levels strongly correlated with delayed SIVmac251 acquisition, and functional and structural data suggest that NCI05 targets a transient state of the viral spike apex that is partially opened, compared to its prefusion-closed conformation. IMPORTANCE Studies suggest that the protection against SIV/simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) acquisition afforded by the SIV/HIV V1 deletion-containing envelope immunogens, delivered by the DNA/ALVAC vaccine platform, requires multiple innate and adaptive host responses. Anti-inflammatory macrophages and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC-10), together with CD14+ efferocytes, are consistently found to correlate with a vaccine-induced decrease in the risk of SIV/SHIV acquisition. Similarly, V2-specific antibody responses mediating ADCC, Th1 and Th2 cells expressing no or low levels of CCR5, and envelope-specific NKp44+ cells producing interleukin 17 (IL-17) also are reproducible correlates of decreased risk of virus acquisition. We focused on the function and the antiviral potential of two monoclonal antibodies (NCI05 and NCI09) isolated from vaccinated animals that differ in antiviral function in vitro and recognize V2 in a linear (NCI09) or coil/helical (NCI05) conformation. We demonstrate that NCI05, but not NCI09, delays SIVmac251 acquisition, highlighting the complexity of antibody responses to V2.", "Keywords": ["CH59", "NCI05", "NCI09", "V2", "monoclonal antibodies", "simian immunodeficiency virus", "trogocytosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Simian Immunodeficiency Virus", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Viral Proteins", "Epitopes", "Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Models, Molecular", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Animals", "Macaca", "Antibodies, Viral"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Stamos", "Affiliation": "Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad Arif", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giacomo", "Last Name": "Gorini", "Affiliation": "Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isabela", "Last Name": "Silva de Castro", "Affiliation": "Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Becerra-Flores", "Affiliation": "New York University Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Van Wazer", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kombo F", "Last Name": "N'Guessan", "Affiliation": "Henry M.

Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) of Env using peptide tags has provided mechanistic insights into the dynamics of Env conformations. Nevertheless, using peptide tags risks potential effects on structural integrity. Here, we aim to establish minimally invasive smFRET systems of Env on the virus by combining genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal click chemistry. Amber stop-codon suppression allows site-specifically incorporating noncanonical/unnatural amino acids (ncAAs) at introduced amber sites into proteins. However, ncAA incorporation into Env (or other HIV-1 proteins) in the virus context has been challenging due to low copies of Env on virions and incomplete amber suppression in mammalian cells. Here, we developed an intact amber-free virus system that overcomes impediments from preexisting ambers in HIV-1. Using this system, we successfully incorporated dual ncAAs at amber-introduced sites into Env on intact virions. Dual-ncAA incorporated Env retained similar neutralization sensitivities to neutralizing antibodies as wildtype. smFRET of click-labeled Env on intact amber-free virions recapitulated conformational profiles of Env. The amber-free HIV-1 infectious system also permits in-virus protein bioorthogonal labeling, compatible with various advanced microscopic studies of virus entry, trafficking, and egress in living cells.

We have therefore adapted a method of B cell immortalization for use with RM B cells. In this system, RM B cells are activated with CD40 ligand and RM IL-21 before transduction with a retroviral vector encoding Bcl-6, Bcl-xL, and green fluorescent protein. Importantly, RM B cells from lymph nodes are more effectively immortalized by this method than B cells from PBMC, a difference not seen in humans. We suggest the discrepancy between these two tissues is due to increased expression of CD40 on RM lymph node B cells. Immortalized RM B cells expand long-term, undergo minimal somatic hypermutation, express surface B cell receptor, and secrete antibodies into culture. This allows for the identification of cells based on antigen specificity and/or functional assays. Here, we show the characterization of this system and its application for the isolation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies from a SHIV.CH505-infected animal, both with and without antigen probe.

antibody (bNAb) epitope in variable loop 2 (V2) at the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer apex. Here, we tested the immunogenicity of germ line-targeting versions of a chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) Env in human V2-apex bNAb heavy-chain precursor-expressing knock-in mice and as chimeric simian-chimpanzee immunodeficiency viruses (SCIVs) in rhesus macaques (RMs). Trimer immunization of knock-in mice induced V2-directed NAbs, indicating activation of V2-apex bNAb precursor-expressing mouse B cells. SCIV infection of RMs elicited high-titer viremia, potent autologous tier 2 neutralizing antibodies, and rapid sequence escape in the canonical V2-apex epitope. Six of seven animals also developed low-titer heterologous plasma breadth that mapped to the V2-apex. Antibody cloning from two of these animals identified multiple expanded lineages with long heavy chain third complementarity determining regions that cross-neutralized as many as 7 of 19 primary HIV-1 strains, but with low potency. Negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) of members of the two most cross-reactive lineages confirmed V2 targeting but identified an angle of approach distinct from prototypical V2-apex bNAbs, with antibody binding either requiring or inducing an occluded-open trimer. Probing with conformation-sensitive, nonneutralizing antibodies revealed that SCIV-expressed, but not wild-type SIVcpz Envs, as well as a subset of primary HIV-1 Envs, preferentially adopted a more open trimeric state. These results reveal the existence of a cryptic V2 epitope that is exposed in occluded-open SIVcpz and HIV-1 Env trimers and elicits cross-neutralizing responses of limited breadth and potency. IMPORTANCE An effective HIV-1 vaccination strategy will need to stimulate rare precursor B cells of multiple bNAb lineages and affinity mature them along desired pathways. Here, we searched for V2-apex germ line-targeting Envs among a large set of diverse primate lentiviruses and identified minimally modified versions of one chimpanzee SIV Env that bound several human V2-apex bNAb precursors and stimulated one of these in a V2-apex bNAb precursor-expressing knock-in mouse. We also generated chimeric simian-chimpanzee immunodeficiency viruses and showed that they elicit low-titer V2-directed heterologous plasma breadth in six of seven infected rhesus macaques. Characterization of this antibody response identified a new class of weakly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that target the V2-apex, but only in occluded-open Env trimers. The existence of this cryptic epitope, which in some Env backgrounds is immunodominant, needs to be considered in immunogen design.", "Keywords": ["SCIV", "V2-apex", "broadly neutralizing antibodies",

that streamline the isolation of antibodies and the generation of B cell clones are of great interest. Retroviral transduction to express Bcl-6 and Bcl-xL and transform primary B cells has been shown to promote long-term B cell survival and antibody secretion in vitro, and can be used to isolate antibodies from memory B cells. However, application of this methodology to B cell subsets from different tissues and B cells from chronically infected individuals has not been well characterized. Here, we characterize Bcl-6/Bcl-xL B cell immortalization across multiple tissue types and B cell subsets in healthy and HIV-1 infected individuals, as well as individuals recovering from malaria. In healthy individuals, na\u00efve and memory B cell subsets from PBMCs and tonsil tissue transformed with similar efficiencies, and displayed similar characteristics with respect to their longevity and immunoglobulin secretion. In HIV-1-viremic individuals or in individuals with recent malaria infections, the exhausted CD27-CD21- memory B cells transformed with lower efficiency, but the transformed B cells expanded and secreted IgG with similar efficiency. Importantly, we show that this methodology can be used to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies from HIV-infected individuals. Overall, we demonstrate that Bcl-6/Bcl-xL B cell immortalization can be used to isolate antibodies and generate B cell clones from different B cell populations, albeit with varying efficiencies.",

Activity and Crystal Structures of HIV-1 gp120 Antagonists.", "Abstract": "As part of our effort to discover drugs that target HIV-1 entry, we report the antiviral activity and crystal structures of two novel inhibitors in a complex with a gp120 core. NBD-14204 showed similar antiviral activity against all the clinical isolates tested. The IC50 values were in the range of 0.24-0.9 \u00b5M with an overall mean of 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M, showing slightly better activity against the clinical isolates than against the lab-adapted HIV-1HXB2 (IC50 = 0.96 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M). Moreover, the antiviral activity of NBD-14208 was less consistent, showing a wider range of IC50 values (0.66-5.7 \u00b5M) with an overall mean of 3 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5M and better activity against subtypes B and D (Mean IC50 2.2-2.5 \u00b5M) than the A, C and Rec viruses (Mean IC50 2.9-3.9 \u00b5M). SI of NBD-14204 was about 10-fold higher than NBD-14208, making it a better lead compound for further optimization. In addition, we tested these compounds against S375Y and S375H mutants of gp120, which occurred in some clades and observed these to be sensitive to NBD-14204 and NBD-14208. These inhibitors also showed modest activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structures of both inhibitors in complexes with gp120 cores. As expected, both NBD-14204 and NBD-14208 bind primarily within the Phe43 cavity. It is noteworthy that the electron density of the thiazole ring in both structures was poorly defined due to the flexibility of this scaffold, suggesting that these compounds maintain substantial entropy, even when bound to the Phe43 cavity.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1", "antiviral", "crystal structure", "cytotoxicity", "envelope glycoprotein (Env)", "gp120 antagonist"], "MeSH terms": ["HIV-1", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Thiazoles", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "CD4 Antigens"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Curreli", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Modeling and Drug Design, Lindsey F.

We developed a method to obtain immunoglobulin sequences with concurrent rapid production and functional assessment of monoclonal antibodies from hundreds of single B cells sorted by flow cytometry. Infection with any variant elicited similar cross-binding antibody responses exhibiting a conserved hierarchy of epitope immunodominance.

Peptide-Directed Vaccines against HIV-1.", "Abstract": "Conjugate-vaccine immunogens require three components: a carrier protein, an antigen, and a crosslinker, capable of coupling antigen to carrier protein, while preserving both T-cell responses from carrier protein and B-cell responses from antigen. We previously showed that the N-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8) as an antigen could prime for broad cross-clade neutralizing responses, that recombinant heavy chain of tetanus toxin (rTTHC) as a carrier protein provided optimal responses, and that choice of crosslinker could impact both antigenicity and immunogenicity. Here, we delve more deeply into the impact of varying the linker between FP8 and rTTHC. In specific, we assessed the physical properties, the antigenicity, and the immunogenicity of conjugates for crosslinkers ranging in spacer-arm length from 1.5 to 95.2 \u00c5, with varying hydrophobicity and crosslinking-functional groups. Conjugates coupled with different degrees of multimerization and peptide-to-rTTHC stoichiometry, but all were well recognized by HIV-fusion-peptide-directed antibodies VRC34.01, VRC34.05, PGT151, and ACS202 except for the conjugate with the longest linker (24-PEGylated SMCC; SM(PEG)24), which had lower affinity for ACS202, as did the conjugate with the shortest linker (succinimidyl iodoacetate; SIA), which also had the lowest peptide-to-rTTHC stoichiometry. Murine immunizations testing seven FP8-rTTHC conjugates elicited fusion-peptide-directed antibody responses, with SIA- and SM(PEG)24-linked conjugates eliciting lower responses than the other five conjugates. After boosting with prefusion-closed envelope trimers from strains BG505 clade A and consensus clade C, trimer-directed antibody-binding responses were lower for the SIA-linked conjugate; elicited neutralizing responses were similar, however, though statistically lower for the SM(PEG)24-linked conjugate, when tested against a strain especially sensitive to fusion-peptide-directed responses. Overall, correlation analyses revealed the immunogenicity of FP8-rTTHC conjugates to be negatively impacted by hydrophilicity and extremes of length or low peptide-carrier stoichiometry, but robust to other linker parameters, with several commonly used crosslinkers yielding statistically indistinguishable serological results.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "conjugate vaccine", "crosslinker", "fusion

"Abstract": "We report the engineering and selection of two synthetic proteins-FSR16m and FSR22-for the possible treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. FSR16m and FSR22 are trimeric proteins composed of DARPin SR16m or SR22 fused with a T4 foldon. Despite selection by a spike protein from a now historical SARS-CoV-2 strain, FSR16m and FSR22 exhibit broad-spectrum neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 strains, inhibiting authentic B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and BA.1.1 viruses, with respective IC50 values of 3.4, 2.2 and 7.4\u2009ng\u2009ml-1 for FSR16m. Cryo-EM structures revealed that these DARPins recognize a region of the receptor-binding domain (residues 456, 475, 486, 487 and 489) overlapping a critical portion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding surface. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with B.1.617.2 and receiving intranasally administered FSR16m showed less weight loss and 10-100-fold lower viral burden in upper and lower respiratory tracts. The strong and broad neutralization potency makes FSR16m and FSR22 promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins", "COVID-19", "Mice, Transgenic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vikas", "Last Name": "Chonira", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, Bryan, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young D", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "James Brett", "Last Name": "Case", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqiang", "Last Name": "Ku", "Affiliation": "Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudo", "Last Name": "Simeon", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, Bryan, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan G", "Last Name": "Casner", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darcy R", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tyler", "Last Name": "Stephens", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center Electron Microscopy Unit, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Bender", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Boyd", "Affiliation": "Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "I-Ting", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center Electron Microscopy Unit, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Krammer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ningyan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Diamond", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA. mdiamond@wustl.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. pkwong@mail.nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqiang", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. zhiqiang.an@uth.tmc.edu."}, {"First Name": "Zhilei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, Bryan, TX, USA. zchen4@tamu.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature chemical biology", "PubDate": "2023Mar"}, {"PMID": "36382536", "Title": "Antibodies as drugs-a Keystone Symposia report.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies have broad indications across diverse disease states, such as oncology, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases.

Conversely, the immunosubdominant yet conserved HA stem harbors a supersite that is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), representing a prime target for universal vaccines. Here, we showed that the co-immunization of two HA stem immunogens derived from group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses elicits cross-group protective immunity and neutralizing antibody responses in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Immunized mice were protected from multiple group 1 and 2 viruses, and all animal models showed broad serum-neutralizing activity. A bnAb isolated from an immunized NHP broadly neutralized and protected against diverse viruses, including H5N1 and H7N9. Genetic and structural analyses revealed strong homology between macaque and human bnAbs, illustrating common biophysical constraints for acquiring cross-group specificity.

During the characterization and production of this bNAb, we observed several unusual features. First, the antibody appeared to adhere to pipette tips, requiring tips to be changed during serial dilution to accurately measure potency. Second, during production scale-up, proteolytic cleavage was discovered to target an extended heavy chain loop, which was attributed to a protease in spent medium from 2-week culture. To enable large scale production, we altered the site of cleavage via a single amino acid change, K100mA. The resultant antibody retained potency and breadth while avoiding protease cleavage. We also added the half-life extending mutation LS, which improved the in vivo persistence in animal models, but did not impact neutralization activity; we observed the same preservation of neutralization for bNAbs VRC01, N6, and PGDM1400 with LS on a 208-virus panel. The final engineered antibody, CAP256V2LS, retained the extraordinary neutralization potency of the parental antibody, had a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in animal models, and was negative in in vitro assessment of autoreactivity.

This evasion stems from amino-acid substitutions, particularly in the receptor-binding domain of the spike, that confer resistance to vaccines and antibodies 2-16. To constrain viral escape through resistance mutations, we combined antibody variable regions that recognize different receptor binding domain (RBD) sites17,18 into multispecific antibodies. Here, we describe multispecific antibodies, including a trispecific that prevented virus escape >3000-fold more potently than the most effective clinical antibody or mixtures of the parental antibodies. Despite being generated before the evolution of Omicron, this trispecific antibody potently neutralized all previous variants of concern and major Omicron variants, including the most recent BA.4/BA.5 strains at nanomolar concentrations. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed that synergistic neutralization was achieved by engaging different epitopes in specific orientations that facilitated inter-spike binding. An optimized trispecific antibody also protected Syrian hamsters against Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5, each of which uses different amino acid substitutions to mediate escape from therapeutic antibodies. Such multispecific antibodies decrease the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 escape, simplify treatment, and maximize coverage, providing a strategy for universal antibody therapies that could help eliminate

Here, we report antibody WS6 from a mouse immunized with mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike. WS6 bound diverse beta-coronavirus spikes and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV, and related sarbecoviruses. Epitope mapping revealed WS6 to target a region in the S2 subunit, which was conserved among SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and hCoV-OC43. The crystal structure at 2 \u00c5 resolution of WS6 revealed recognition to center on a conserved S2 helix, which was occluded in both pre- and post-fusion spike conformations. Structural and neutralization analyses indicated WS6 to neutralize by inhibiting fusion and post-viral attachment. Comparison of WS6 with other recently identified antibodies that broadly neutralize beta-coronaviruses indicated a stem-helical supersite-centered on hydrophobic residues Phe1148, Leu1152, Tyr1155,

We identified several mutations that improved recognition, predominately in framework regions, and combined these to produce a panel of antibody variants. The most improved antibody, CIS43_Var10, had three mutations and showed approximately sixfold enhanced protective potency in vivo compared to CIS43. Co-crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of CIS43_Var10 with the peptide epitope or with PfCSP, respectively, revealed functional roles for each of these mutations.

CD4.", "Abstract": "Both SIV and SHIV are powerful tools for evaluating antibody-mediated prevention and treatment of HIV-1. However, owing to a lack of rhesus-derived SIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), testing of bnAbs for HIV-1 prevention or treatment has thus far been performed exclusively in the SHIV NHP model using bnAbs from HIV-1-infected individuals. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of multiple rhesus-derived SIV bnAbs capable of neutralizing most isolates of SIV. Eight antibodies belonging to two clonal families, ITS102 and ITS103, which target unique epitopes in the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) region, were found to be broadly neutralizing and together neutralized all SIV strains tested. A rare feature of these bnAbs and two additional antibody families, ITS92 and ITS101, which mediate strain-specific neutralizing activity against SIV from sooty mangabeys (SIVsm), was their ability to achieve near complete (i.e. 100%) neutralization of moderately and highly neutralization-resistant SIV. Overall, these newly identified SIV bnAbs highlight the potential for evaluating HIV-1 prophylactic and therapeutic interventions using fully simian, rhesus-derived bnAbs in the SIV NHP model, thereby circumventing issues related to rapid antibody clearance of human-derived antibodies, Fc mismatch and limited genetic diversity of SHIV compared to SIV.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Macaca mulatta", "Simian Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hugh C", "Last Name": "Welles", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hannah A D", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leonard", "Last Name": "Nettey", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cavett", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center Electron Microscopy Unit, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Renguang", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kaimei", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Ambrozak", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Ransier", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Adrienne E", "Last Name": "Swanstrom", "Affiliation": "AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Hoxie", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Celia", "Last Name": "LaBranche", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Montefiori", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Douek", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Roederer", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rosemarie D", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "35677079", "Title": "Potent and pan-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by DARPins.", "Abstract": "We report the engineering and selection of two synthetic proteins - FSR16m and FSR22 - for possible treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The IC 50 values of FSR16m against authentic B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and BA.1.1 variants are 3.4 ng/mL, 2.2 ng/mL and 7.4 ng/mL, respectively, comparable to currently used therapeutic antibodies. Despite the use of the spike protein from a now historical wild-type virus for design, FSR16m and FSR22 both exhibit increased neutralization against newly-emerged variants of concern (39- to 296-fold) in pseudovirus assays. Cryo-EM structures revealed that these DARPins recognize a region of the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 455-456, 486-489) overlapping a critical portion of the ACE2-binding surface. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with a B.1.617.2 variant and receiving intranasally-administered FSR16m were protected as judged by less weight loss and 10-100-fold reductions in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors.

LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2.

Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved, except for N439 and N501. The binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y).

Lectins thus hold great promise as therapeutic and diagnostic proteins, exemplified by their potent antiviral activities and the desire to engineer synthetic carbohydrate receptors based on lectin recognition principles. Here, we describe a new carbohydrate-binding architectural motif\u2500namely, a C3-symmetric tyrosine-based aromatic core, present in the therapeutic lectin griffithsin (GRFT). By using structure-based amino acid substitutions, X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and HIV-1 neutralization assays, we show that this core is critical for potent (pM) antiviral activity and nanomolar binding to the glycan shield largely consisting of high mannose glycans. Crystal structures and MD simulations show that CH-\u03c0 interactions stabilize the aromatic cluster to maintain the three pseudo-symmetric carbohydrate-binding sites, nonaromatic amino acid substitutions (Tyr to Ala) abrogate antiviral activity, and increasing the aromatic CH-\u03c0 edge-to-centroid interface via a Tyr to Trp substitution yields a GRFT variant with improved potency and increased residence time of Man-9 observed in MD simulations. NMR titrations of a Tyr-to-Ala variant indicate that disruption of the aromatic prevents the intermolecular crosslinking between two equivalents of Man-9 and one carbohydrate-binding face observed in wild-type GRFT and known to be critical for picomolar potency of this lectin. This C3-symmetric aromatic core defines a new recognition motif for the design of carbohydrate receptors and suggests principles for engineering known lectins to have increased affinity and stability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Carbohydrates", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lectins", "Plant Lectins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiadong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gengxiang", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tatsiana", "Last Name": "Bylund", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Myungjin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Srikar", "Last Name": "Adibhatla", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carole A", "Last Name": "Bewley", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2022Jun17"}, {"PMID": "35489332", "Title": "Structure of an influenza group 2-neutralizing antibody targeting the hemagglutinin stem supersite.", "Abstract": "Several influenza antibodies with broad group 2 neutralization have recently been isolated.

Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses, suggesting that 10-40 is a promising agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses but also uncovered a distinct antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif.

To gain insight into their recognition, we determined crystal structures of four llama nanobodies (J3, A12, C8, and D7), all of which targeted the CD4-binding site, in complex with the HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp120 core, and determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of J3 with the Env trimer. Crystal and cryo-EM structures of J3 complexes revealed this nanobody to mimic binding to the prefusion-closed trimer for the primary site of CD4 recognition as well as a secondary quaternary site. In contrast, crystal structures of A12, C8, and D7 with gp120 revealed epitopes that included portions of the gp120 inner domain, inaccessible on the prefusion-closed trimer.

The basis for such cross-protection at the molecular level is incompletely understood. Here we characterized the repertoire and epitope specificity of antibodies elicited by Beta, Gamma and ancestral variant infection and assessed their cross-reactivity to these and the more recent Delta and Omicron variants. We developed a high-throughput approach to obtain immunoglobulin sequences and produce monoclonal antibodies for functional assessment from single B cells. Infection with any variant elicited similar cross-binding antibody responses exhibiting a remarkably conserved hierarchy of epitope immunodominance. Furthermore, convergent V gene usage and similar public B cell clones were elicited regardless of infecting variant.

(Env) is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that block viral entry. Single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that HIV-1 Env exists in at least three conformational states on the virion. Prior to complete host-receptor engagement (State 3), Env resides most prevalently in the smFRET-defined State 1, which is preferentially recognized by most bnAbs that are elicited by natural infection. smFRET has also revealed that soluble trimers containing prefusion-stabilizing disulfide and isoleucine-to-proline substitutions reside primarily in State 2, which is a required intermediate between States 1 and 3. While high-resolution Env structures have been determined for States 2 and 3, the structure of these trimers in State 1 is unknown. To provide insight into the State 1 structure, here we characterized antigenic differences between smFRET-defined states and then correlated these differences with known structural differences between States 2 and 3. We found that cell surface-expressed Env was enriched in each state using state-enriching antibody fragments or small-molecule virus entry inhibitors and then assessed binding to HIV-1 bnAbs preferentially binding different states. We observed small but consistent differences in binding between Env enriched in States 1 and 2, and a more than 10-fold difference in binding to Env enriched in these states versus Env enriched in State 3. We conclude that structural differences between HIV-1 Env States 1 and 3 are likely more than 10-fold greater than those between States 1 and 2, providing important insight into State\u00a01.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1", "SOSIP", "broadly neutralizing antibody", "conformational change", "flow cytometry", "glycoprotein structure", "intermediate conformations", "smFRET"], "MeSH terms": ["Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Protein Conformation", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evan M", "Last Name": "Cale", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jefferson I", "Last Name": "Driscoll", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myungjin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maolin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yen-Ting", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walther", "Last Name": "Mothes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

S mediates virus entry and is the primary target for antibody responses, with structural studies of soluble S variants revealing an increased propensity toward conformations accessible to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, real-time observations of conformational dynamics that govern the structural equilibriums of the S variants have been lacking. Here, we report single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies of critical mutations observed in VOCs, including D614G and E484K, in the context of virus particles. Investigated variants predominately occupied more open hACE2-accessible conformations, agreeing with previous structures of soluble trimers. Additionally, these S variants exhibited slower transitions in hACE2-accessible/bound states. Our finding of increased S kinetic stability in the open conformation provides a new perspective on SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to the human population. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 surface S glycoprotein-the target of antibodies and vaccines-is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor hACE2. The interactions between S and hACE2 trigger structural rearrangements of S from closed to open conformations prerequisite for virus entry. Under the selection pressure imposed by adaptation to the human host and increasing vaccinations and convalescent patients, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving and has adopted numerous mutations on S variants. These promote virus spreading and immune evasion, partially by increasing the propensity of S to adopt receptor-binding competent open conformations. Here, we determined a time dimension, using smFRET to delineate the temporal prevalence of distinct structures of S in the context of virus particles. We present the first experimental evidence of decelerated transition dynamics from the open state, revealing increased stability of S open conformations to be part of the SARS-CoV-2 adaption strategies.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2 variants", "conformational dynamics", "single-molecule FRET", "spike glycoprotein", "structure"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Receptors, Virus", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "Biological Evolution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ziwei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale Universitygrid.47100.32 School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shilei", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherche du CHUM (CRCHUM), D\u00e9partement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Healthgrid.94365.3d, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Healthgrid.94365.3d, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9s", "Last Name": "Finzi", "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherche du CHUM (CRCHUM), D\u00e9partement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Healthgrid.94365.3d, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walther", "Last Name": "Mothes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale Universitygrid.47100.32 School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maolin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, Texas, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2021Feb22"}, {"PMID": "35118472", "Title": "Vaccine-elicited murine antibody WS6 neutralizes diverse beta-coronaviruses by recognizing a helical stem supersite of vulnerability.", "Abstract": "Immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike elicits diverse antibodies, but can any of these neutralize broadly?

Such antibody responses to stem-specific epitopes have been extensively characterized for HA subtypes H1 and H5 in humans. H2N2 influenza virus circulated 50 years ago and represents a pandemic threat due to the lack of widespread immunity, but, unlike H1 and H5, the H2 HA stem contains Phe45HA2 predicted to sterically clash with HA stem-binding antibodies characterized to date. To understand the effect of Phe45HA2, we compared the HA stem-specific B cell response in post hoc analyses of two phase 1 clinical trials, one testing vaccination with an H2 ferritin nanoparticle immunogen ( NCT03186781 ) and one with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine ( NCT01086657 ). In H2-naive individuals, the magnitude of the B cell response was equivalent, but H2-elicited HA stem-binding B cells displayed greater cross-reactivity than those elicited by H5. However, in individuals with childhood H2 exposure, H5-elicited HA stem-binding B cells also displayed high cross-reactivity, suggesting recall of memory B cells formed 50 years ago. Overall, we propose that a one-residue difference on an HA immunogen can alter establishment and expansion of broadly neutralizing memory B cells.

The RNA nature and broad circulation of this virus facilitate the accumulation of mutations, leading to the continuous emergence of variants of concern with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity 1 . This poses a major challenge to the effectiveness of current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies 1, 2 . Thus, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and preventive measures with a broad spectrum of action, especially against variants with an unparalleled number of mutations such as the recently emerged Omicron variant, which is rapidly spreading across the globe 3 . Here, we used combinatorial antibody phage-display libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients to generate monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ultrapotent neutralizing activity. One such antibody, NE12, neutralizes an early isolate, the WA-1 strain, as well as the Alpha and Delta variants with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations at picomolar level. A second antibody, NA8, has an unusual breadth of neutralization, with picomolar activity against both the Beta and Omicron variants.

Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccines, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring the vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors. We deposited these constructs to Addgene to enable their dissemination.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of these two antibodies and 179NC75, a previously identified glycan276-dependent CD4bs antibody, in complex with HIV-envelope trimer reveal substantially different modes of glycan276 recognition. Despite these differences, binding of glycan276-dependent antibodies maintains a glycan276 conformation similar to that observed in the absence of glycan276-binding antibodies. By contrast, glycan276-independent CD4bs antibodies, such as VRC01, displace glycan276 upon binding. These results provide a foundation for understanding antibody recognition of glycan276 and suggest its presence may be crucial for priming immunogens seeking to initiate broad CD4bs recognition.", "Keywords": ["CD4 binding site", "N276", "antibody approach angle", "antibody-antigen binding", "cryo-EM", "glycan conformation", "glycan276", "immunogen design"], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibody Specificity", "Binding Sites, Antibody", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "CD4 Antigens", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Epitopes", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Single Molecule Imaging", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Cottrell", "Affiliation": "IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center, Consortium for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD), Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kartik", "Last Name": "Manne", "Affiliation": "Duke University Human Vaccine Institute, Departments of Medicine and Surgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA;

Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with DH1047 was protective against SARS-CoV, WIV-1, RsSHC014, and SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 infection in mice. Binding and structural analysis showed high affinity binding of DH1047 to an epitope that is highly conserved among sarbecoviruses. Thus, DH1047 is a broadly protective antibody that can prevent infection and mitigate outbreaks caused by SARS-related strains and SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Although there is no licensed HMPV vaccine, promising candidates have been identified for related pneumoviruses based on the structure-based stabilization of the fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer, with prefusion-stabilized F glycoprotein trimers eliciting significantly higher neutralizing responses than their postfusion F counterparts. However, immunization with HMPV F trimers in either prefusion or postfusion conformations has been reported to elicit equivalent neutralization responses. Here we investigate the impact of stabilizing disulfides, especially interprotomer disulfides (IP-DSs) linking protomers of the F trimer, on the elicitation of HMPV-neutralizing responses. We designed F trimer disulfides, screened for their expression, and used electron microscopy (EM) to confirm their formation, including that of an unexpected postfusion variant. In mice, IP-DS-stabilized prefusion and postfusion HMPV F elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses than non-IP-DS-stabilized HMPV Fs. In macaques, the impact of IP-DS stabilization was more measured, although IP-DS-stabilized variants of either prefusion or postfusion HMPV F induced neutralizing responses many times the average titers observed in a healthy human cohort. Serological and absorption-based analyses of macaque responses revealed elicited HMPV-neutralizing responses to be absorbed differently by IP-DS-containing and by non-IP-DS-containing postfusion Fs, suggesting IP-DS stabilization to alter not only the immunogenicity of select epitopes but their antigenicity as well. We speculate the observed increase in immunogenicity by IP-DS trimers to be related to reduced interprotomer flexibility within the HMPV F trimer.", "Keywords": ["disulfide-based stabilization", "nonhuman primates", "paramyxoviruses", "structure-based vaccine design", "type I fusion machines"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Disulfides", "Epitopes", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Immunization", "Macaca", "Metapneumovirus", "Mice", "Mutation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guillaume B E", "Last Name": "Stewart-Jones", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Ou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Foulds", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Wing-Pui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Mallika", "Last Name": "Sastry", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Chen-Hsiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "John-Paul", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21701."}, {"First Name": "Raffaello", "Last Name": "Verardi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Corti", "Affiliation": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Lanzavecchia", "Affiliation": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Diana G", "Last Name": "Scorpio", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892; pdkwong@nih.gov ubuchholz@niaid.nih.gov jmascola@nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Ursula J", "Last Name": "Buchholz", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892; pdkwong@nih.gov ubuchholz@niaid.nih.gov jmascola@nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892; pdkwong@nih.gov ubuchholz@niaid.nih.gov jmascola@nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Sep28"}, {"PMID": "34461095", "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike ages through distinct states with altered immunogenicity.", "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike is the primary target of virus-neutralizing antibodies and critical to the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.

On a 208-strain panel, variant VRC01.23LS neutralized 90% of the panel at a geometric mean IC80 less than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, and in transgenic mice with human neonatal-Fc receptor, the serum half-life of VRC01.23LS was indistinguishable from that of the parent VRC01LS, which has a half-life of 71\u00a0d in humans. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of VRC01.23 Fab in complex with BG505 DS-SOSIP.664 Env trimer determined at 3.4-\u00c5 resolution confirmed the structural basis for its ~10-fold improved potency relative to VRC01. Another variant, VRC07-523-F54-LS.v3, neutralized 95% of the 208-isolated panel at a geometric mean IC80 of less than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, with a half-life comparable to that of the parental VRC07-523LS. Our matrix-based structural approach thus enables the engineering of VRC01 variants for HIV-1 therapy and prevention with improved potency, breadth, and pharmacokinetics.", "Keywords": ["Antibody VRC01", "HIV-1 envelope trimer", "broadly neutralizing antibody", "matrix-based design", "polyreactivity", "prophylaxis", "treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Young D", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mangaiarkarasi", "Last Name": "Asokan", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qingbo", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bob C", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amarendra", "Last Name": "Pegu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raffaello", "Last Name": "Verardi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eun Sung", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vrc Production", "Last Name": "Program", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Carlton", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Lusso", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "Journal": "mAbs", "PubDate": "2021Jan-Dec"}, {"PMID": "34315825", "Title": "Protective antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination are boosted in the lung after challenge in nonhuman primates.", "Abstract": "Adjuvanted soluble protein vaccines have been used extensively in humans for protection against various viral infections based on their robust induction of antibody responses. Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized spike protein trimers (preS dTM) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHPs). Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that the vaccinated NHP developed AS03-dependent multifunctional humoral responses that targeted distinct domains of the spike protein and bound to a variety of Fc receptors mediating immune cell effector functions in vitro. The neutralizing 50% inhibitory concentration titers for pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 were higher than titers for a panel of human convalescent serum samples. NHPs were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3 \u00d7 106 plaque forming units) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days after challenge, vaccinated NHPs showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Vaccinated NHPs also had increased spike protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days after challenge. Moreover, passive transfer of vaccine-induced IgG to hamsters mediated protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These data show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine were sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 in NHPs and that rapid anamnestic antibody responses in the lung may be a key mechanism for protection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "Cricetinae", "Immunization, Passive", "Lung",

10E8 might have utility in HIV therapy and prophylaxis. However, 10E8 displays a three-peak profile on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), complicating its manufacture. Here we show cis-trans conformational isomerization of the Tyr-Pro-Pro (YPP) motif in the heavy chain 3rd complementarity-determining region (CDR H3) of antibody 10E8 to be the mechanistic basis of its multipeak behavior. We observed 10E8 to undergo slow conformational isomerization and delineate a mechanistic explanation for effective comodifiers that were able to resolve its SEC heterogeneity and to allow an evaluation of the critical quality attribute of aggregation. We determined crystal structures of single and double alanine mutants of a key di-proline motif and of a light chain variant, revealing alternative conformations of the CDR H3. We also replicated both multi-peak and delayed SEC behavior with MPER-antibodies 4E10 and VRC42, by introducing a Tyr-Pro (YP) motif into their CDR H3s. Our results show how a conformationally dynamic CDR H3 can provide the requisite structural plasticity needed for a highly hydrophobic paratope to recognize its membrane-proximal epitope.", "Keywords": ["MPER", "cis-trans proline isomerization", "conformational isomerization", "hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)", "mobile phase modifier", "monoclonal antibody 10E8", "secondary matrix interaction", "size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Young", "Last Name": "Do Kwon", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiangchun E", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Bender", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yile", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Schneck", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Shaddeau", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank J", "Last Name": "Arnold", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "HIV-Specific Immunity Section of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Q Paula", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Production Program, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA."}], "Journal": "Antibodies (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2021Jun10"}, {"PMID": "34135892", "Title": "Sequence-Signature Optimization Enables Improved Identification of Human HV6-1-Derived Class Antibodies That Neutralize Diverse Influenza A Viruses.", "Abstract": "Sequence signatures of multidonor broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies can be used to quantify the prevalence of B cells with virus-neutralizing potential to accelerate development of broadly protective vaccine strategies. Antibodies of the same class share similar recognition modes and developmental pathways, and several antibody classes have been identified that neutralize diverse group 1- and group 2-influenza A viruses and have been observed in multiple human donors. One such multidonor antibody class, the HV6-1-derived class, targets the stem region of hemagglutinin with extraordinary neutralization breadth. Here, we use an iterative process to combine informatics, biochemical, and structural analyses to delineate an improved sequence signature for HV6-1-class antibodies. Based on sequence and structure analyses of known HV6-1 class antibodies, we derived a more inclusive signature (version 1), which we used to search for matching B-cell transcripts from published next-generation sequencing datasets of influenza vaccination studies. We expressed selected antibodies, evaluated their function, and identified amino acid-level requirements from which to refine the sequence signature (version 2). The cryo-electron microscopy structure for one of the signature-identified antibodies in complex with hemagglutinin confirmed motif recognition to be similar to known HV6-1-class members, MEDI8852 and 56.a.09, despite differences in recognition-loop length. Threading indicated the refined signature to have increased accuracy, and signature-identified heavy chains, when paired with the light chain of MEDI8852, showed neutralization comparable to the most potent members of the class. Incorporating sequences of additional class members thus enables an improved sequence signature for HV6-1-class antibodies, which can identify class members with increased accuracy.", "Keywords":

Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group\u00a01 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group\u00a02 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group\u00a02 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and-to our knowledge-rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

immunogens present challenges for GMP manufacturing. The HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein trimer is covered by N-linked glycan comprising half its mass and requires both trimer assembly and subunit cleavage to fold into a prefusion-closed conformation. This conformation, the vaccine-desired antigenic state, is both metastable to structural rearrangement and labile to subunit dissociation. Prior reported GMP manufacturing for a soluble trimer stabilized in a near-native state by disulfide (SOS) and Ile-to-Pro (IP) mutations has employed affinity methods based on antibody 2G12, which recognizes only ~30% of circulating HIV strains. Here, we develop a scalable manufacturing process based on commercially available, non-affinity resins, and we apply the process to current GMP (cGMP) production of trimers from clades A and C, which have been found to boost cross-clade neutralizing responses in vaccine-test species. The clade A trimer, which we named \"BG505 DS-SOSIP.664\", contained an engineered disulfide (201C-433C; DS) within gp120, which further stabilized this trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation resistant to CD4-induced triggering. BG505 DS-SOSIP.664 was expressed in a CHO-DG44 stable cell line and purified with initial and final tangential flow filtration steps, three commercially available resin-based chromatography steps, and two orthogonal viral clearance steps. The non-affinity purification enabled efficient scale-up, with a 250 L-scale cGMP run yielding 9.6\u00a0g of purified BG505 DS-SOSIP.664. Antigenic analysis indicated retention of a prefusion-closed conformation, including recognition by apex-directed and fusion peptide-directed antibodies. The developed manufacturing process was suitable for 50 L-scale production of a second prefusion-stabilized Env trimer vaccine candidate, ConC-FP8v2 RnS-3mut-2G-SOSIP.664, yielding 7.8\u00a0g of this consensus clade C trimer. The successful process development and purification scale-up of HIV-1 Env trimers from different clades by using commercially available materials provide experimental demonstration for cGMP manufacturing of trimeric HIV-Env vaccine immunogens, in an antigenically desired conformation, without the use of costly affinity resins.", "Keywords": ["DS-SOSIP", "Envelope trimer", "GMP manufacturing", "Glycoprotein", "HIV-1 vaccine", "Non-affinity chromatography", "Prefusion-closed conformation"], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV-1", "Protein Multimerization", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krishana", "Last Name": "Gulla", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cibelli", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan W", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haley C", "Last Name": "Fuller", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zachary", "Last Name": "Schneiderman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Witter", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaqiu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anita", "Last Name": "Changela", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Hatcher", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandeep", "Last Name": "Narpala", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Vrc Production ProgramVaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adrian B", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

However, the emergence of variants of concern has negatively impacted the therapeutic use of some authorized mAbs. Using a high throughput B-cell screening pipeline, we isolated a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody called LY-CoV1404 (also known as bebtelovimab). LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the prototype, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2). In pseudovirus neutralization studies, LY-CoV1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, B.1.1.529, and the BA.2 subvariant and retains binding to spike proteins with a variety of underlying RBD mutations including K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y. Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved with the exception of N439 and N501. Notably, the binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The breadth of reactivity to amino acid substitutions present among current VOC together with broad and potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants causing COVID-19.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Westendorf",

We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations.

These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden.

Although several bNAbs are already under clinical evaluation, the development of antibodies with even greater potency and breadth remains a priority. Recently, we reported a novel strategy for improving bNAbs against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 by engraftment of the elongated framework region 3 (FR3) from VRC03, which confers the ability to establish quaternary interactions with a second gp120 protomer. Here, we applied this strategy to a new series of anti-CD4bs bNAbs (N49 lineage) that already possess high potency and breadth. The resultant chimeric antibodies bound the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer with a higher affinity than their parental forms. Likewise, their neutralizing capacity against a global panel of HIV-1 Envs was also increased. The introduction of additional modifications further enhanced the neutralization potency. We also tried engrafting the elongated CDR1 of the heavy chain from bNAb 1-18, another highly potent quaternary-binding antibody, onto several VRC01-class bNAbs, but none of them was improved. These findings point to the highly selective requirements for the establishment of quaternary contact with the HIV-1 Env trimer. The improved anti-CD4bs antibodies reported here may provide a helpful complement to current antibody-based protocols for the therapy and prevention of HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCE Monoclonal antibodies represent one of the most important recent innovations in the fight against infectious diseases. Although potent antibodies can be cloned from infected individuals, various strategies can be employed to improve their activity or pharmacological features. Here, we improved a lineage of very potent antibodies that target the receptor-binding site of HIV-1 by engineering chimeric molecules containing a fragment from a different monoclonal antibody.

A single dose of the prefusion-stabilized fusion (F) glycoprotein subunit vaccine (DS-Cav1) substantially increases serum-neutralizing activity in healthy adults. We sought to determine whether DS-Cav1 vaccination induces a repertoire mirroring the pre-existing diversity from natural infection or whether antibody lineages targeting specific epitopes predominate. We evaluated RSV F-specific B cell responses before and after vaccination in six participants using complementary B cell sequencing methodologies and identified 555 clonal lineages. DS-Cav1-induced lineages recognized the prefusion conformation of F (pre-F) and were genetically diverse. Expressed antibodies recognized all six antigenic sites on the pre-F trimer. We identified 34 public clonotypes, and structural analysis of two antibodies from a predominant clonotype revealed a common mode of recognition. Thus, vaccination with DS-Cav1 generates a diverse polyclonal response targeting the antigenic sites on pre-F, supporting the development and advanced testing of pre-F-based vaccines against RSV.", "Keywords": ["RSV", "antibody repertoire", "cryo-EM structure", "fusion glycoprotein", "memory B cells", "neutralizing antibodies", "prefusion", "public clonotypes", "respiratory syncytial virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Antibody Formation", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Epitopes", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human", "Vaccination", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maryam", "Last Name": "Mukhamedova", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA;

We have recently isolated human antibodies that target the junctional region between the N-terminal and repeat domains that are not included in RTS,S. Due to the fact that these antibodies protect against malaria challenge in mice, their epitopes could be effective vaccine targets. Here, we developed immunogens displaying PfCSP junctional epitopes by genetic fusion to either the N-terminus or B domain loop of the E2 protein from chikungunya (CHIK) alphavirus and produced CHIK virus-like particles (CHIK-VLPs). The structural integrity of these junctional-epitope-CHIK-VLP immunogens was confirmed by negative-stain electron microscopy. Immunization of these CHIK-VLP immunogens reduced parasite liver load by up to 95% in a mouse model of malaria infection and elicited better protection than when displayed on keyhole limpet hemocyanin, a commonly used immunogenic carrier. Protection correlated with PfCSP serum titer. Of note, different junctional sequences elicited qualitatively different reactivities to overlapping PfCSP peptides. Overall, these results show that the junctional epitopes of PfCSP can induce protective responses when displayed on CHIK-VLP immunogens and provide a basis for the development of a next generation

syncytial virus (BRSV). In this study, calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies were vaccinated once, either with (i) a BRSV pre-fusion protein (PreF) and MontanideTM ISA61 VG (ISA61, n = 6), (ii) BRSV lacking the SH gene (\u0394SHrBRSV, n = 6), (iii) a commercial vaccine (CV, n = 6), or were injected with ISA61 alone (n = 6). All calves were challenged with BRSV 92 days later and were euthanized 13 days post-infection. Based on clinical, pathological, and proteomic data, all vaccines appeared safe. Compared to the controls, PreF induced the most significant clinical and virological protection post-challenge, followed by \u0394SHrBRSV and CV, whereas the protection of PreF-vaccinated calves was correlated with BRSV-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody responses 84 days post-vaccination, and the IgG antibody titers of \u0394SHrBRSV- and CV-vaccinated calves did not differ from the controls on this day. Nevertheless, strong anamnestic BRSV- and PreF-specific IgG responses occurred in calves vaccinated with either of the vaccines, following a BRSV challenge. In conclusion, PreF and \u0394SHrBRSV are two efficient one-shot candidate vaccines.

Multiple vaccines have been deployed to date, but the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has recently challenged their efficacy. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 variants originating in the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and New York (B.1.526) have reduced neutralization activity from convalescent sera and compromised the efficacy of antibody cocktails that received emergency use authorization. Whereas vaccines can be updated periodically to account for emerging variants, complementary strategies are urgently needed to avert viral escape. One potential alternative is the use of camelid VHHs (also known as nanobodies), which due to their small size can recognize protein crevices that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and \"nanomice\" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. Through binding assays and cryo-electron microscopy, we identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. The first group expresses VHHs that circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a region outside the ACE2-binding site that is conserved in coronaviruses but is not typically targeted by monoclonal antibodies. The second group is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, they do neutralize the RBD variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianliang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seolkyoung", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Conte", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jenna", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frauke", "Last Name": "Muecksch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julio Cesar", "Last Name": "Cetrulo Lorenzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Solji", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zijun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lino", "Last Name": "Tessarollo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatsiana", "Last Name": "Bylund", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tyler", "Last Name": "Stephens", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "I-Ting", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Theodora", "Last Name": "Hatziioannou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Bieniasz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel C", "Last Name": "Nussenzweig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Casellas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2021Mar04"}, {"PMID": "33688656", "Title": "Increased Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variant P.1 to Antibody Neutralization.", "Abstract": "The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody neutralization has been described recently.

Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized spike trimers (preS dTM) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHP). Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of antibody FC receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC50 titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera. NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3\u00d7106 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Notably, vaccinated NHP also had increased spike-specific IgG antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days post challenge. Moreover, vaccine-induced IgG mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge following passive transfer to hamsters. These data show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine are sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 and support the evaluation of this vaccine in human clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph R", "Last Name": "Francica", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara J", "Last Name": "Flynn", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Foulds", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy T", "Last Name": "Noe", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne P", "Last Name": "Werner", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ian N", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Gagne", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy S", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Tucker", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Britta", "Last Name": "Flach", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "O'Connell", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shayne F", "Last Name": "Andrew", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Lamb", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dillon R", "Last Name": "Flebbe", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saule T", "Last Name": "Nurmukhambetova", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitzi M", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "John-Paul M", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex Lee", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Atyeo", "Affiliation": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Fischinger", "Affiliation": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Venkata Viswanadh", "Last Name": "Edara", "Affiliation": "Centers for Childhood Infections and Vaccines;

It is not more resistant to plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 or sera from individuals who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.351 variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain but also by multiple individual monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding motif of the receptor-binding domain, which is mostly due to a mutation causing an E484K substitution.

To analyze whether this MPER-epitope tag might aid structural studies of small membrane proteins, we determined an X-ray crystal structure of a membrane protein target that does not crystallize without the aid of crystallization chaperones, the Fluc fluoride channel, fused to the MPER epitope and in complex with antibody. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for single particle electron microscopy with Fluc and two additional small membrane proteins that represent different membrane protein folds, AdiC and GlpF. These studies show that the MPER epitope provides a structurally defined, rigid docking site for antibody fragments that is transferable among diverse membrane proteins and can be engineered without prior structural information.

By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations.

However, the neutralization potency of two antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike, was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of 1-57 and 2-7 in complex with spike, revealing each of these antibodies to utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably, each antibody represented a response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes. Moreover, many epitope residues recognized by 1-57 and 2-7 were outside hotspots of evolutionary pressure for both ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the therapeutic use of antibodies like 1-57 and 2-7, which target less prevalent epitopes, could ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Micah", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jude", "Last Name": "Bimela", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eswar R", "Last Name": "Reddem", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2021Feb22"}, {"PMID": "33649208", "Title": "Mutational fitness landscapes reveal genetic and structural improvement pathways for a vaccine-elicited HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody.", "Abstract": "Vaccine-based elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies holds great promise for preventing HIV-1 transmission. However, the key biophysical markers of improved antibody recognition remain uncertain in the diverse landscape of potential antibody mutation pathways, and a more complete understanding of anti-HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP) antibody development will accelerate rational vaccine designs. Here we survey the mutational landscape of the vaccine-elicited anti-FP antibody, vFP16.02, to determine the genetic, structural, and functional features associated with antibody improvement or fitness. Using site-saturation mutagenesis and yeast display functional screening, we found that 1% of possible single mutations improved HIV-1 envelope trimer (Env) affinity, but generally comprised rare somatic hypermutations that may not arise frequently in vivo. We observed that many single mutations in the vFP16.02 Fab could enhance affinity >1,000-fold against soluble FP, although affinity improvements against the HIV-1 trimer were more measured and rare. The most potent variants enhanced affinity to both soluble FP and Env, had mutations concentrated in antibody framework regions, and achieved up to 37% neutralization breadth compared to 28% neutralization of the template antibody. Altered heavy- and light-chain interface angles and conformational dynamics, as well as reduced Fab thermal stability, were associated with improved HIV-1 neutralization breadth and potency. We also observed parallel sets of mutations that enhanced viral neutralization through similar structural mechanisms. These data provide a quantitative understanding of the mutational landscape for vaccine-elicited FP-directed broadly neutralizing antibody and demonstrate that numerous antigen-distal framework mutations can improve antibody function by enhancing affinity simultaneously toward HIV-1 Env and FP.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1 vaccines", "broadly neutralizing antibodies", "fusion peptide", "somatic hypermutation", "yeast display"], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mutation", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bharat", "Last Name": "Madan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Cara W", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Jacy R", "Last Name": "Wolfe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Ahmed S", "Last Name": "Fahad", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Thuy Duong", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Arne", "Last Name": "Sch\u00f6n", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Rajani", "Last Name": "Nimrania", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045."}, {"First Name": "Yiran", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Bob C", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Brandon J", "Last Name": "DeKosky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045; dekosky@ku.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Mar09"}, {"PMID": "33554060", "Title": "Anti-V2 antibodies virus vulnerability revealed by envelope V1 deletion in HIV vaccine candidates.", "Abstract": "The efficacy of ALVAC-based HIV and SIV vaccines in humans and macaques correlates with antibodies to envelope variable region 2 (V2).

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Single and combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization1-3, with more in the pipeline4-7. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise8, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against COVID-199,10. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. The recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK11 and B.1.351 in South Africa12 is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a few mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is not more resistant to convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera.

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization, and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation.

Immunoassays with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies revealed the antigenicity of S2P-NDVLP to be generally similar to that of soluble S2P, and negative-stain electron microscopy showed S2P on the NDVLP surface to be displayed with a morphology corresponding to its prefusion conformation. Mice immunized with S2P-NDVLP showed substantial neutralization titers (geometric mean ID50 = 386) two weeks after prime immunization, significantly higher than those elicited by a molar equivalent amount of soluble S2P (geometric mean ID50 = 17). Neutralizing titers at Week 5, two weeks after a boost immunization with S2P-NDVLP doses ranging from 2.0 to 250 \u03bcg, extended from 2125 to 4552, and these generally showed a higher ratio of neutralization versus ELISA than observed with soluble S2P.

The VRC01 class of bnAbs targets the CD4-binding site on the HIV-envelope trimer and requires extensive somatic hypermutation (SHM) to neutralize effectively. Despite substantial progress, vaccine-induced VRC01-class antibodies starting from unmutated precursors have exhibited limited neutralization breadth, particularly against viruses bearing glycan on loop D residue N276 (glycan276), present on most circulating strains. Here, using sequential immunization of immunoglobulin (Ig)-humanized mice expressing diverse unmutated VRC01-class antibody precursors, we elicited serum responses capable of neutralizing viruses bearing glycan276 and isolated multiple lineages of VRC01-class bnAbs, including two with >50% breadth on a 208-strain panel. Crystal structures of representative bnAbs revealed the same mode of recognition as known VRC01-class bnAbs. Structure-function studies further pinpointed key mutations and correlated their induction with specific immunizations. VRC01-class bnAbs can thus be matured by sequential immunization from unmutated ancestors to >50% breadth, and we delineate immunogens and regimens inducing key SHM.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1 vaccine", "antibody VRC01", "broadly neutralizing antibody", "glyan276", "somatic hypermutation"], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "Disease Models, Animal", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin", "Vaccination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongying", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bob C", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen-Hsiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle X", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Center for Infectious Diseases Research, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frederick W", "Last Name": "Alt", "Affiliation": "Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

"Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients.

envelope (Env) N-glycosylation impact virus-cell entry and immune evasion. How each glycan interacts to shape the Env-protein-sugar complex and affects Env function is not well understood. Here, analysis of two Env variants from the same donor, with differing functional characteristics and N-glycosylation-site composition, revealed that changes to key N-glycosylation sites affected the Env structure at distant locations and had a ripple effect on Env-wide glycan processing, virus infectivity, antibody recognition, and virus neutralization. Specifically, the N262 glycan, although not in the CD4-binding site, modulated Env binding to the CD4 receptor, affected Env recognition by several glycan-dependent neutralizing antibodies, and altered site-specific glycosylation heterogeneity, with, for example, N448 displaying limited glycan processing. Molecular-dynamic simulations visualized differences in glycan density and how specific oligosaccharide positions can move to compensate for a glycan loss. This study demonstrates how changes in individual glycans can alter molecular dynamics, processing, and function of the Env-glycan shield.", "Keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biological Sciences", "Glycobiology", "Microbiology", "Virology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audra A", "Last Name": "Hargett", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbora", "Last Name": "Knoppova", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Duverger", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen-Hsiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "S Katie", "Last Name": "Farney", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stacy", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rhubell", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon F", "Last Name": "Keele", "Affiliation": "AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonya L", "Last Name": "Heath", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Saag", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olaf", "Last Name": "Kutsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zina", "Last Name": "Moldoveanu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Milan", "Last Name": "Raska", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Renfrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Novak", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 845 19th Street S, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}], "Journal": "iScience", "PubDate": "2020Nov20"}, {"PMID": "33121334", "Title": "Removal of variable domain N-linked glycosylation as a means to improve the homogeneity of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies are showing promise in the treatment and prevention of HIV-1, with several now being evaluated clinically. Some lead clinical candidates, including antibodies CAP256-VRC26.25, N6, PGT121, and VRC07-523, have one or more N-linked glycosylation sequons in their variable domains (Fvs) from somatic hypermutation, and these glycans increase chemical heterogeneity, complicating the manufacture of these antibodies as products. Here we propose a general method to remove Fv glycans and use this method to develop engineered versions of these four antibodies with Fv glycans removed. When germline residues were introduced to remove each glycan, antibody properties between wild type and mutant were not significantly altered for CAP256-VRC26.25 and PGT121; however, germline mutants for N6 and VRC07-523 showed increased polyreactivity, which is known to correlate with unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetics. To reduce polyreactivity induced by removal of Fv glycan, we mutated aromatic residues and arginines structurally proximal to the removed glycan and identified Fv glycan-removed variants with low polyreactivity for N6 and VRC07-523. Two such variants, N6-N72LCQ-R18LCD and VRC07-523-N72LCQ-R24LCD, showed thermostability, neutralization potency and breadth, and half-life in humanized FcRn mice that were similar to their wild-type Fv-glycosylated counterparts. The removal of Fv glycan and reduction of chemical heterogeneity were confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer-stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher-could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with 0.08 \u00b5g of SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticle elicited\u00a0similar neutralizing responses as 2.0 \u00b5g of spike, which was\u2009~\u200925-fold higher\u00a0on a\u00a0weight-per-weight basis.

(SARS-CoV-2) spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. Here, we design constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions include full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also design mutants that eliminate recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection range from \u223c0.5\u00a0mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5\u00a0mg/L for several subregions. Probes are characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe is determined by cryoelectron microscopy. We also characterize antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain probes.", "Keywords":

S is synthesized as a precursor, processed into S1 and S2 by furin proteases, and activated for fusion when human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) engages the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and when the N-terminus of S2 is proteolytically processed. Structures of soluble ectodomains and native virus particles have revealed distinct conformations of S, including a closed trimer with all RBD oriented downward, trimers with one or two RBDs up, and hACE2-stabilized conformations with up to three RBD oriented up. Real-time information that connects these structures, however, has been lacking. Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate, with trypsin partially activating S. Conformational preferences of convalescent patient plasma and monoclonal antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either direct competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry.

Here, we identify and characterize a multidonor antibody class (LPAF-a class) targeting the HA head. This class exhibits potent viral entry inhibition against H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (CA09) virus. LPAF-a class antibodies derive from the HV2-70 gene and contain a \"Tyr-Gly-Asp\"-motif, which occludes the HA-sialic acid binding site as revealed by a co-crystal structure with HA. Both germline-reverted and mature LPAF antibodies potently neutralize CA09 virus and have nanomolar affinities for CA09 HA. Moreover, increased frequencies for LPFA-a class antibodies are observed in humans after a single vaccination.

Here, we investigated the viral and host immunity factors responsible for the unusual severity of AHB associated with the precore HBV mutant in chimpanzees. Archived serial serum and liver specimens from two chimpanzees inoculated with a precore HBV mutant implicated in ALF and two chimpanzees inoculated with wild-type HBV were studied. We used phage-display library and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the liver antibody response. The results obtained in severe AHB were compared with those in classic AHB and HBV-associated ALF in humans. Severe AHB was characterized by: (i) the highest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) peaks ever seen in HBV transmission studies with a significantly shorter incubation period, compared to classic AHB; (ii) earlier HBsAg clearance and anti-HBs seroconversion with transient or undetectable hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg); (iii) limited inflammatory reaction relative to hepatocellular damage at the ALT peak with B-cell infiltration, albeit less extensive than in ALF; (iv) detection of intrahepatic germline antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) by phage-display libraries in the earliest disease phase, as seen in ALF; (v) lack of intrahepatic IgM anti-HBcAg Fab, as seen in classic AHB, but at variance with ALF; and (vi) higher proportion of antibodies in germline configuration detected by NGS in the intrahepatic antibody repertoire compared to classic AHB, but lower than in ALF. This study identifies distinct outcome-specific features associated with severe AHB caused by a precore HBV mutant in chimpanzees, which bear closer resemblance to HBV ALF than to classic AHB.

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to &gt;5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes. Funding: Support for this work was provided by the Intramural Research Program of the Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Support for this work was also provided by COVID-19 Fast Grants, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Self Graduate Fellowship Program, and NIH grants DP5OD023118, R21AI143407, and R21AI144408. Some of this work was performed at the Columbia University Cryo-EM Center at the Zuckerman Institute, and some at the Simons Electron Microscopy Center (SEMC) and National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training (NCCAT) located at the New York Structural Biology Center, supported by grants from the Simons Foundation (SF349247), NYSTAR, and the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM103310). Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. Ethical Approval: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for B cell sorting were obtained from a convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patient (collected 75 days post symptom onset under an IRB approved clinical trial protocol, VRC 200 - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00067054) and a healthy control donor from the NIH blood bank pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "HRV3C protease",

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9\u00a0ng\u00a0ml-1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

"Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer - stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher - could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles elicited ~25-fold higher neutralizing responses, weight-per-weight relative to spike alone. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric viral antigens, with SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles inducing particularly potent neutralizing responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National

Antibodies can engage RBD but some, such as CR3022, fail to inhibit entry despite nanomolar spike affinity. Here we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have low unfolding enthalpy at serological pH and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where we observe significantly reduced CR3022 affinity. Cryo-EM structures -at serological and endosomal pH- delineated spike recognition of up to three ACE2 molecules, revealing RBD to freely adopt the 'up' conformation. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824-858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning and spike shedding of antibodies like CR3022.

Recombinant Env trimers have been studied structurally, but characterization of Env embedded in intact virus membranes has been limited to low resolution. Here, we deploy cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structures of Env trimers on aldrithiol-2 (AT-2)-inactivated virions in ligand-free, antibody-bound and CD4-bound forms at subnanometer resolution. Tomographic reconstructions document molecular features consistent with high-resolution structures of engineered soluble and detergent-solubilized Env trimers.

Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes.

Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro , 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, \"all RBD-down\" conformation of the spike.

Antibody-based peptide interactions are often used to quantify yeast surface expression (e.g., by fusing a target protein to a FLAG, Myc, polyhistidine, or other peptide tag). However, antibody-antigen interactions require high stability for accurate quantification, and conventional tag systems based on such interactions may not be compatible with a low pH environment. In this study, a SNAP tag was introduced to a yeast display platform to circumvent disadvantages of conventional antibody display tags at low pH. SNAP forms a covalent bond with its small-molecule substrate, enabling precise and pH-independent protein display tagging. We compared the SNAP tag to conventional antibody-based peptide fusion and to direct fluorescent domain fusion using antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) gene libraries as a case study in low pH protein engineering. Our results demonstrated that covalent SNAP tags can effectively quantify protein-surface expression at low pH, enabling the enrichment of Fc variants with increased affinity at pH 6.0 to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Incorporation of a covalent SNAP tag thus overcomes disadvantages of conventional antibody-based expression tags and enables protein-engineering applications outside of physiological pH.", "Keywords": ["Fc-FcRn", "Low pH protein engineering", "SNAP", "Yeast display"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Surface Display Techniques", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments", "Receptors, Fc", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Yeasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bharat", "Last Name": "Madan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brooklyn K", "Last Name": "Mussman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amen T", "Last Name": "Hailemariam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahmed S", "Last Name": "Fahad", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacy R", "Last Name": "Wolfe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young Do", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon J", "Last Name": "DeKosky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA; Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA; Kansas Vaccine Institute, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA.

PreF and N proteins are potent antigenic targets for neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, respectively. To tackle the challenges of neonatal immunization, three groups of six one-month-old calves with maternally derived serum antibodies (MDA) to BRSV received a single intramuscular injection of PreF, preF+N with MontanideTM ISA61 VG (ISA61) as adjuvant or only ISA61 (control). One month later, all calves were challenged with BRSV and monitored for virus replication in the upper respiratory tract and for clinical signs of disease over one week, and then post-mortem examinations of their lungs were performed. Both preF and preF+N vaccines afforded safe, clinical, and virological protection against BRSV, with little difference between the two subunit vaccines.

One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1", "fusion peptide", "neutralization", "vaccine"], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies,

While liver damage in classic acute hepatitis B is believed to be T-cell mediated, the pathogenesis of HBV-associated ALF remains largely unknown. Access to liver specimens from well-characterized patients with HBV-associated ALF provided us with the opportunity to perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire VH repertoires of IgM and IgG from the livers of four ALF patients, a control liver donor and a patient with chronic HBV infection. We found that ALF is not associated with expansion of specific B-cell lineages. However, NGS showed that the intrahepatic VH repertoires from ALF patients were characterized by the abundant presence of antibodies in germline configuration in contrast to their marginal prevalence in controls. Moreover, NGS identified a large number of VH genes in germline configuration with identical VDJ sequences in the IgM and IgG repertoires in all four ALF patients, indicating that isotype switch from IgM to IgG had occurred without somatic hypermutation. The results of this study indicate that the presence of intrahepatic antibodies in unmutated germline configuration is a broad phenomenon in the global antibody repertoire generated from total RNA derived from whole-liver tissue that is strongly associated with ALF, suggesting a major role of T cell-independent humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of ALF.", "Keywords": ["B-cell response", "HBV", "acute liver failure", "germline antibodies", "hepatitis B core antigen", "intrahepatic antibody repertoire", "next-generation sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["B-Lymphocytes", "Hepatitis Antibodies", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B virus", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin M", "Liver Failure, Acute"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhaochun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Hepatic Pathogenesis Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen-Hsiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald E", "Last Name": "Engle", "Affiliation": "Hepatic Pathogenesis Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fausto", "Last Name": "Zamboni", "Affiliation": "Liver Transplantation Center, Azienda Ospedaliera G.

However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice.

common viral causes of childhood bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide, and lack effective antiviral drugs or vaccines. Recombinant (r) HPIV3 was modified to express the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, the major RSV neutralization and protective antigen, providing a live intranasal bivalent HPIV3/RSV vaccine candidate. This extends previous studies using a chimeric bovine-human PIV3 vector (rB/HPIV3). One advantage is that rHPIV3 expresses all of the HPIV3 antigens compared to only two for rB/HPIV3. In addition, the use of rHPIV3 as vector should avoid excessive attenuation following addition of the modified RSV F gene, which may occur with rB/HPIV3. To enhance its immunogenicity, RSV F was modified (i) to increase the stability of the prefusion (pre-F) conformation and (ii) by replacement of its transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains with those of HPIV3 F (H3TMCT) to increase incorporation in the vector virion. RSV F (+/- H3TMCT) was expressed from the first (F/preN) or the second (F/N-P) gene position of rHPIV3. The H3TMCT modification dramatically increased packaging of RSV F into the vector virion and, in hamsters, resulted in significant increases in the titer of high-quality serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in addition to the increase conferred by pre-F stabilization. Only F-H3TMCT/preN replication was significantly attenuated in the nasal turbinates by the RSV F insert. F-H3TMCT/preN, F/N-P, and F-H3TMCT/N-P provided complete protection against wt RSV challenge. F-H3TMCT/N-P exhibited the most stable and highest expression of RSV F, providing impetus for its further development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Intranasal", "Animals", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cricetinae", "Female", "Humans", "Immunogenicity, Vaccine", "Macaca mulatta", "Mesocricetus", "Parainfluenza Vaccines", "Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human", "Protein Stability", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines", "Vero Cells", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Virus Assembly"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xueqiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Emerito", "Last Name": "Amaro-Carambot", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Surman", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Barney S", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shirin", "Last Name": "Munir", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "31893251", "Title": "Crystal Structure and Immunogenicity of the DS-Cav1-Stabilized Fusion Glycoprotein From Respiratory Syncytial Virus Subtype B.", "Abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subtypes, A and B, co-circulate in annual epidemics and alternate in dominance.

Two Env mutations were identified, one in loop D (N279K) and another in V5 (G458Y), that acted synergistically to render autologous CH505 transmitted/founder virus susceptible to neutralization by CH235 UCA. Man5-enriched N-glycans provided additional synergy for neutralization. CH235 UCA bound with nanomolar affinity to corresponding soluble native-like Env trimers as candidate immunogens. A cryo-EM structure of CH235 UCA bound to Man5-enriched CH505.N279K.G458Y.SOSIP.664 revealed interactions of the antibody light chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR L3) with the engineered Env loops D and V5. These results demonstrate that virus neutralization can directly inform vaccine design and suggest a germline targeting and reverse engineering strategy to initiate and mature the CH235 bnAb lineage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Antibody Affinity", "Binding Sites", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "CD4 Antigens", "Drug Design",

We also identified highly mutated \"off-track\" lineage members that share high sequence identity to broad members but lack breadth. Here, we defined the mutations that limit the breadth of these antibodies and the probability of their emergence. Mutants and chimeras between two pairs of closely related antibodies were generated: CAP256.04 and CAP256.25 (30% and 63% breadth, respectively) and CAP256.20 and CAP256.27 (2% and 59% breadth). Antibodies were tested against 14 heterologous HIV-1 viruses and select mutants to assess breadth and epitope specificity. A single R100rA mutation in the third heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDRH3) introduced breadth into CAP256.04, but all three CAP256.25 heavy chain CDRs were required for potency. In contrast, in the CAP256.20/27 chimeras, replacing only the CDRH3 of CAP256.20 with that of CAP256.27 completely recapitulated breadth and potency, likely through the introduction of three charge-reducing mutations. In this individual, the mutations that limited the breadth of the off-track antibodies were predicted to occur with a higher probability than those in the naturally paired bNAbs, suggesting a low barrier to the evolution of the off-track phenotype. Mapping studies to determine the viral immunotypes (or epitope variants) that selected off-track antibodies indicated that unlike broader lineage members, CAP256.20 preferentially neutralized viruses containing 169Q. This suggests that this globally rare immunotype, which was common in donor CAP256, drove the off-track phenotype. These data show that affinity maturation to counter globally rare viral immunotypes can drive antibodies within a broad lineage along multiple pathways towards strain-specificity. Defining developmental pathways towards and away from breadth may facilitate the selection of immunogens that elicit bNAbs and minimize off-track antibodies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "Epitope Mapping", "Epitopes", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Neutralization Tests", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sacks", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jinal N", "Last Name": "Bhiman", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Wiehe", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Penny L", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2019Sep"}, {"PMID": "31473167", "Title": "Safety and pharmacokinetics of broadly neutralising human monoclonal antibody VRC07-523LS in healthy adults: a phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial.", "Abstract": "Human monoclonal antibodies that potently and broadly neutralise HIV-1 are under development to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection.

The humoral response was dominated by GII.4-specific antibodies that blocked ancestral strains or by antibodies that bound to divergent genotypes and did not block viral-entry-ligand interactions. However, one antibody, A1431, showed broad blockade toward tested GII.4 strains and neutralized the pandemic GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney strain. Structural mapping revealed conserved epitopes, which were occluded on the virion or partially exposed, allowing for broad blockade with neutralizing activity.

"Consistent elicitation of cross-clade HIV-neutralizing responses achieved in guinea pigs after fusion peptide priming by repetitive envelope trimer boosting.", "Abstract": "The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing responses is a central goal of HIV research. Recently, we elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses against the N terminus of the fusion peptide (FP), a critical component of the HIV-entry machinery. While the consistency of the elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses was good in mice, it was poor in guinea pigs: after seven immunizations comprising either envelope (Env) trimer or FP coupled to a carrier, serum from only one of five animals could neutralize a majority of a cross-clade panel of 19 wild-type strains. Such a low response rate-only 20%-made increasing consistency an imperative. Here, we show that additional Env-trimer immunizations could boost broad FP-directed neutralizing responses in a majority of immunized animals. The first boost involved a heterologous Env trimer developed from the transmitted founder clade C strain of donor CH505, and the second boost involved a cocktail that combined the CH505 trimer with a trimer from the BG505 strain. After boosting, sera from three of five animals neutralized a majority of the 19-strain panel and serum from a fourth animal neutralized 8 strains. We demonstrate that cross-reactive serum neutralization targeted the FP by blocking neutralization with soluble fusion peptide. The FP competition revealed two categories of elicited responses: an autologous response to the BG505 strain of high potency (~10,000 ID50), which was not competed by soluble FP, and a heterologous response of lower potency, which was competed by soluble FP. While the autologous response could increase rapidly in response to Env-trimer boost, the heterologous neutralizing response increased more slowly. Overall, repetitive Env-trimer immunizations appeared to boost low titer FP-carrier primed responses to detectable levels, yielding cross-clade neutralization. The consistent trimer-boosted neutralizing responses described here add to accumulating evidence for the vaccine utility of the FP site of HIV vulnerability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS

observed by smFRET.", "Abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer mediates cell entry and is conformationally dynamic1-8. Imaging by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that, on the surface of intact virions, mature pre-fusion Env transitions from a pre-triggered conformation (state 1) through a default intermediate conformation (state 2) to a conformation in which it is bound to three CD4 receptor molecules (state 3)8-10. It is currently unclear how these states relate to known structures. Breakthroughs in the structural characterization of the HIV-1 Env trimer have previously been achieved by generating soluble and proteolytically cleaved trimers of gp140 Env that are stabilized by a disulfide bond, an isoleucine-to-proline substitution at residue 559 and a truncation at residue 664 (SOSIP.664 trimers)5,11-18. Cryo-electron microscopy studies have been performed with C-terminally truncated Env of the HIV-1JR-FL strain in complex with the antibody PGT15119. Both approaches have revealed similar structures for Env. Although these structures have been presumed to represent the pre-triggered state 1 of HIV-1 Env, this hypothesis has never directly been tested. Here we use smFRET to compare the conformational states of Env trimers used for structural studies with native Env on intact virus. We find that the constructs upon which extant high-resolution structures are based predominantly occupy downstream conformations that represent states 2 and 3. Therefore, the structure of the pre-triggered state-1 conformation of viral Env that has been identified by smFRET and that is preferentially stabilized by many broadly neutralizing antibodies-and thus of interest for the design of immunogens-remains unknown.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cattle", "Disulfides", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer",

However, most unadapted SHIVs do not replicate well in vivo limiting their utility. Furthermore, adaptation in vivo often negatively impacts fundamental properties of the Env, including neutralization profiles. Transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses are particularly important to study since they represent viruses that initiated primary HIV-1 infections and may have unique attributes. Here we combined in vivo competition and rational design to develop novel subtype C SHIVs containing T/F envelopes. We successfully generated 19 new, infectious subtype C SHIVs, which were tested in multiple combinatorial pools in Indian-origin rhesus macaques. Infected animals attained peak viremia within 5 weeks ranging from 103 to 107 vRNA copies/mL. Sequence analysis during primary infection revealed 7 different SHIVs replicating in 8 productively infected animals with certain clones prominent in each animal. We then generated 5 variants each of 6 SHIV clones (3 that predominated and 3 undetectable after pooled in vivo inoculations), converting a serine at Env375 to methionine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan or phenylalanine. Overall, most Env375 mutants replicated better in vitro and in vivo than wild type with both higher and earlier peak viremia. In 4 of these SHIV clones (with and without Env375 mutations) we also created mutations at position 281 to include serine, alanine, valine, or threonine. Some Env281 mutations imparted in vitro replication dynamics similar to mutations at 375; however, clones with both mutations did not exhibit incremental benefit. Therefore, we identified unique subtype C T/F SHIVs that replicate in rhesus macaques with improved acute phase replication kinetics without altering phenotype. In vivo competition and rational design can produce functional SHIVs with globally relevant HIV-1 Envs to add to the growing number of SHIV clones for HIV-1 research in NHPs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

All three lineages had modest levels of somatic hypermutation and normal antibody-loop lengths and were initiated by the founder virus\u00a0MPER. The broadest lineage, VRC42, was similar to the known bNAb 4E10. A multimeric immunogen based on the founder MPER activated\u00a0B cells bearing the unmutated common ancestor of VRC42, with modest maturation of early VRC42 intermediates imparting neutralization breadth.

"Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIVs) use CD4 as the primary receptor to enter target cells. Here, we show that the chimpanzee CD4 is highly polymorphic, with nine coding variants present in wild populations, and that this diversity interferes with SIV envelope (Env)-CD4 interactions. Testing the replication fitness of SIVcpz strains in CD4+ T cells from captive chimpanzees, we found that certain viruses were unable to infect cells from certain hosts. These differences were recapitulated in CD4 transfection assays, which revealed a strong association between CD4 genotypes and SIVcpz infection phenotypes. The most striking differences were observed for three substitutions (Q25R, Q40R, and P68T), with P68T generating a second N-linked glycosylation site (N66) in addition to an invariant N32 encoded by all chimpanzee CD4 alleles. In silico modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified charged residues at the CD4-Env interface and clashes between CD4- and Env-encoded glycans as mechanisms of inhibition. CD4 polymorphisms also reduced Env-mediated cell entry of monkey SIVs, which was dependent on at least one D1 domain glycan. CD4 allele frequencies varied among wild chimpanzees, with high diversity in all but the western subspecies, which appeared to have undergone a selective sweep. One allele was associated with lower SIVcpz prevalence rates in the wild. These results indicate that substitutions in the D1 domain of the chimpanzee CD4 can prevent SIV cell entry. Although some SIVcpz strains have adapted to utilize these variants, CD4 diversity is maintained, protecting chimpanzees against infection with SIVcpz and other SIVs to which they are exposed.",

Here, we performed a comprehensive genetic and functional characterization of the virus and the host in liver tissue from HBV-associated ALF and compared the results with those of classic acute hepatitis B in chimpanzees. In contrast with acute hepatitis B, HBV strains detected in ALF livers displayed highly mutated HBV core antigen (HBcAg), associated with increased HBcAg expression ex vivo, which was independent of viral replication levels. Combined gene and miRNA expression profiling revealed a dominant B cell disease signature, with extensive intrahepatic production of IgM and IgG in germline configuration exclusively targeting HBcAg with subnanomolar affinities, and complement deposition.

To obtain a vaccine effective against all four PIV types, we engineered mutations in each of the four PIV fusion (F) glycoproteins to stabilize their metastable prefusion states, as such stabilization had previously enabled the elicitation of high-titer neutralizing antibodies against the related respiratory syncytial virus. A cryoelectron microscopy structure of an engineered PIV3 F prefusion-stabilized trimer, bound to the prefusion-specific antibody PIA174, revealed atomic-level details for how introduced mutations improved stability as well as how a single PIA174 antibody recognized the trimeric apex of prefusion PIV3 F. Nine combinations of six newly identified disulfides and two cavity-filling mutations stabilized the prefusion PIV3 F immunogens and induced 200- to 500-fold higher neutralizing titers in mice than were elicited by PIV3 F in the postfusion conformation. For PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4, we also obtained stabilized prefusion Fs, for which prefusion versus postfusion titers were 2- to 20-fold higher. Elicited murine responses were PIV type-specific, with little cross-neutralization of other PIVs. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), quadrivalent immunization with prefusion-stabilized Fs from PIV1-4 consistently induced potent neutralizing responses against all four PIVs. For PIV3, the average elicited NHP titer from the quadrivalent immunization was more than fivefold higher than any titer observed in a cohort of over 100 human adults, highlighting the ability of a prefusion-stabilized immunogen to elicit especially potent neutralization.", "Keywords": ["antibody", "conformational change", "structure", "vaccine design", "virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals",

Unlike mature antibodies, corresponding VRC01 germline precursors poorly bind to Env. Immunogen design has mostly relied on glycan removal from trimeric Env constructs and has had limited success in eliciting mature VRC01 bnAbs. To better understand elicitation of such bnAbs, we characterized the inferred germline precursor of VRC01 in complex with a modified trimeric 426c Env by cryo-electron microscopy and a 426c gp120 core by X-ray crystallography, biolayer interferometry, immunoprecipitation, and glycoproteomics. Our results show VRC01 germline antibodies interacted with a wild-type 426c core lacking variable loops 1-3 in the presence and absence of a glycan at position Asn276, with the latter form binding with higher affinity than the former. Interactions in the presence of an Asn276 oligosaccharide could be enhanced upon carbohydrate shortening, which should be considered for immunogen design.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "HIV envelope", "VRC01", "cryoEM", "crystallography", "fusion protein", "glycan shield", "molecular biophysics", "structural biology", "virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies", "Germ Cells", "Glycosylation", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Immunoglobulin G", "Models, Molecular", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Borst", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Connor E", "Last Name": "Weidle", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Frenz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joost", "Last Name": "Snijder", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ivelin S", "Last Name": "Georgiev", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States."}, {"First Name": "Guillaume Be", "Last Name": "Stewart-Jones", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "McGuire", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "DiMaio", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Leonidas", "Last Name": "Stamatatos", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Pancera", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Veesler", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2018Nov07"}, {"PMID": "30395637", "Title": "HIV-1 envelope glycan modifications that permit neutralization by germline-reverted VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) induction is a high priority for effective HIV-1 vaccination. VRC01-class bnAbs that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein spikes are particularly attractive to elicit because of their extraordinary breadth and potency of neutralization in vitro and their ability to protect against infection in animal models. Glycans bordering the CD4bs impede the binding of germline-reverted forms of VRC01-class bnAbs and therefore constitute a barrier to early events in initiating the correct antibody lineages. Deleting a subset of these glycans permits Env antigen binding but not virus neutralization, suggesting that additional barriers impede germline-reverted VRC01-class antibody binding to functional Env trimers. We investigated the requirements for functional Env trimer engagement of VRC01-class na\u00efve B cell receptors by using virus neutralization and germline-reverted antibodies as surrogates for the interaction. Targeted deletion of a subset of N-glycans bordering the CD4bs, combined with Man5 enrichment of remaining N-linked glycans that are otherwise processed into larger complex-type glycans, rendered HIV-1 426c Env-pseudotyped virus (subtype C, transmitted/founder) highly susceptible to neutralization by near germline forms of VRC01-class bnAbs. Neither glycan modification alone rendered the virus susceptible to neutralization. The potency of neutralization in some cases rivaled the potency of mature VRC01 against wildtype viruses. Neutralization by the germline-reverted antibodies was abrogated by the known VRC01 resistance mutation, D279K. These findings improve our understanding of the restrictions imposed by glycans in eliciting VRC01-class bnAbs and enable a neutralization-based strategy to monitor vaccine-elicited early precursors of this class of bnAbs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "Binding Sites", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "CD4 Antigens", "Epitopes", "Glycosylation", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Polysaccharides", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Celia C", "Last Name": "LaBranche", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "McGuire", "Affiliation": "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Global Health, Seattle, WA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Global Health, Seattle, WA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shay", "Last Name": "Behrens", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Quentin J", "Last Name": "Sattentau", "Affiliation": "The Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Peacock", "Affiliation": "Duke University School of Medicine, Departments of Medicine and Immunology, Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Eaton", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kelli", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hongmei", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Haili", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lautaro G", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin O", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "Duke University School of Medicine, Departments of Medicine and Immunology, Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leonidas", "Last Name": "Stamatatos", "Affiliation": "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Global Health, Seattle, WA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Montefiori", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2018Nov"}, {"PMID": "30355496", "Title": "Completeness of HIV-1 Envelope Glycan Shield at Transmission Determines Neutralization Breadth.", "Abstract": "Densely arranged N-linked glycans shield the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer from antibody recognition.

To understand the interplay between glycan holes and neutralization breadth in HIV-1 infection, we developed a sequence- and structure-based approach to identify glycan holes for individual Env sequences that are shielded in most M-group viruses. Applying this approach to 12 longitudinally followed individuals, we found that transmitted viruses with more intact glycan shields correlated with development of greater neutralization breadth. Within 2 years, glycan acquisition filled most glycan holes present at transmission, indicating escape from hole-targeting neutralizing antibodies. Glycan hole filling generally preceded the time to first\u00a0detectable breadth, although time intervals varied across hosts.

Recently, Xu et al (2018) elicited cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in a variety of animal models using immunogens based on the epitope of bnAb VRC34.01. The VRC34.01 antibody, which was elicited by natural human infection, targets the N terminus of the Env fusion peptide, a critical component of the virus entry machinery. Here we precisely characterize the functional epitopes of VRC34.01 and two vaccine-elicited murine antibodies by mapping all single amino-acid mutations to the BG505 Env that affect viral neutralization. While escape from VRC34.01 occurred via mutations in both fusion peptide and distal interacting sites of the Env trimer, escape from the vaccine-elicited antibodies was mediated predominantly by mutations in the fusion peptide. Cryo-electron microscopy of four vaccine-elicited antibodies in complex with Env trimer revealed focused recognition of the fusion peptide and provided a structural basis for development of neutralization breadth. Together, these functional and structural data suggest that the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies targeting the fusion peptide can be enhanced by specific interactions with additional portions of Env. Thus, our complete maps of viral escape both delineate pathways of resistance to these fusion peptide-directed antibodies and provide a strategy to improve the breadth or potency of future vaccine-induced antibodies against Env's fusion peptide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Epitope Mapping", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mice", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Dingens", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Division and Computational Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Priyamvada", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hugh K", "Last Name": "Haddox", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Division and Computational Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Reda", "Last Name": "Rawi", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Clinton S", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Overbaugh", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Biology and Epidemiology Program, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jesse D", "Last Name": "Bloom", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Division and Computational Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2018Jul"}, {"PMID": "29902444", "Title": "Interdomain Stabilization Impairs CD4 Binding and Improves Immunogenicity of the HIV-1 Envelope Trimer.", "Abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike is a trimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers that mediates viral entry. Binding to CD4 on the host cell membrane is the first essential step for infection but disrupts the native antigenic state of Env, posing a key obstacle to vaccine development. We locked the HIV-1 Env trimer in a pre-fusion configuration, resulting in impaired CD4 binding and enhanced binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies. This design was achieved via structure-guided introduction of neo-disulfide bonds bridging the gp120 inner and outer domains and was successfully applied to soluble trimers and native gp160 from different HIV-1 clades. Crystallization illustrated the structural basis for CD4-binding impairment. Immunization of rabbits with locked trimers from two different clades elicited neutralizing antibodies against tier-2 viruses with a repaired glycan shield regardless of treatment with a functional CD4 mimic.

The highly diverse glycans on HIV spikes are commonly considered as immunologically silent self-antigens; however, the discovery of highly potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from HIV patients targeting the viral surface glycans has raised a major question about the origin of their antigens. Recent epitope mapping studies of the bNAb PG9 indicated a requirement of a properly spaced high mannose and a complex type glycan connected by a short peptide spacer. We have recently discovered that a 1:1 mixture of Man5 and sialyl biantennary glycan with well-defined distance and without the peptide spacer is well recognized by PG9 with high avidity and, thus, proposed that a hybrid glycan with oligomannose and complex-type arm could be the proper ligand of PG9. To verify this proposition, we first designed and chemo-enzymatically synthesized a series of unusual hybrid-type N-glycan structures, which may exist on HIV surface glycoproteins through the host-guided N-glycosylation pathway. The synthetic hybrid glycans were then used to prepare glycan arrays for the binding studies of PG9 and several other highly potent bNAbs, including PG16, PGT121, PGT128-3C, 2G12, VRC13, VRC-PG05, VRC26.25, VRC26.09, PGDM1400, 35O22, and 10-1074. Our results demonstrated that PG9 and some other bNAbs bind with strong avidity (subnanomolar Kd) to certain hybrid structures, suggesting that these unusual glycans may serve as epitopes for the design of vaccines against HIV.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Ligands", "Polysaccharides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vidya S", "Last Name": "Shivatare", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Sachin S", "Last Name": "Shivatare", "Affiliation": "CHO Pharma, Inc., 18F, Building F, No. 3, Park Street , Nangang District, Taipei 11503 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chang-Chun David", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Hui", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , California 92037 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Kuo-Shiang", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Yang-Yu", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Gannerla", "Last Name": "Saidachary", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chung-Yi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Nan-Horng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "CHO Pharma, Inc., 18F, Building F, No. 3, Park Street , Nangang District, Taipei 11503 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health , 40 Convent Drive , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Dennis R", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , California 92037 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Chung-Yi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Huey", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , 128 Academia Road, Section 2 , Nangang District, Taipei 115 , Taiwan."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2018Apr18"}, {"PMID": "29561264", "Title": "HIV-1 Env trimer opens through an asymmetric intermediate in which individual protomers adopt distinct conformations.", "Abstract": "HIV-1 entry into cells requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) to receptor CD4 and coreceptor.

Passive transfer of one of these antibodies, monoclonal antibody CIS43, conferred high-level, sterile protection in two different mouse models of malaria infection. The affinity and stoichiometry of CIS43 binding to PfCSP indicate that there are two sequential multivalent binding events encompassing the repeat domain. The first binding event is to a unique 'junctional' epitope positioned between the N terminus and the central repeat domain of PfCSP. Moreover, CIS43 prevented proteolytic cleavage of PfCSP on PfSPZ. Analysis of crystal structures of the CIS43 antigen-binding fragment in complex with the junctional epitope determined the molecular interactions of binding, revealed the epitope's conformational flexibility and defined Asn-Pro-Asn (NPN) as the structural repeat motif.

The potential for a future pandemic originating from animal reservoirs or health care-associated events is a major public health concern. There are no vaccines or therapeutic agents currently available for MERS-CoV. Using a probe-based single B cell cloning strategy, we have identified and characterized multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specifically binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 (non-RBD) regions from a convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patient and from immunized rhesus macaques. RBD-specific MAbs tended to have greater neutralizing potency than non-RBD S1-specific MAbs. Six RBD-specific and five S1-specific MAbs could be sorted into four RBD and three non-RBD distinct binding patterns, based on competition assays, mapping neutralization escape variants, and structural analysis. We determined cocrystal structures for two MAbs targeting the RBD from different angles and show they can bind the RBD only in the \"out\" position. We then showed that selected RBD-specific, non-RBD S1-specific, and S2-specific MAbs given prophylactically prevented MERS-CoV replication in lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge. Importantly, combining RBD- and non-RBD MAbs delayed the emergence of escape mutations in a cell-based virus escape assay. These studies identify MAbs targeting different antigenic sites on S that will be useful for defining mechanisms of MERS-CoV neutralization and for developing more effective interventions to prevent or treat MERS-CoV infections.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes a highly lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or antiviral therapeutic options are currently available. Based on continuing exposure from established reservoirs in dromedary camels and bats, transmission of MERS-CoV into humans and future outbreaks are expected. Using structurally defined probes for the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S), the target for neutralizing antibodies, single B cells were sorted from a convalescent human and immunized nonhuman primates (NHPs). MAbs produced from paired immunoglobulin gene sequences were mapped to multiple epitopes within and outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and protected against lethal MERS infection in a murine model following passive immunization. Importantly, combining MAbs targeting distinct epitopes prevented viral neutralization escape from RBD-directed MAbs. These data suggest that antibody responses to multiple domains on CoV spike protein may improve immunity and will guide future vaccine and therapeutic development efforts.", "Keywords": ["MERS-CoV",

neutralizing antibody responses. A platform that has been successfully used for displaying antigens from a number of different viruses is ferritin, a self-assembling protein nanoparticle that allows the attachment of multiple copies (24 monomers or 8 trimers) of a single antigen. Here, we design two-component ferritin variants that allow the attachment of two different antigens on a single particle in a defined ratio and geometric pattern. The two-component ferritin was specifically designed for trimeric antigens, accepting four trimers per particle for each antigen, and was tested with antigens derived from HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA). Particle formation and the presence of native-like antigen conformation were confirmed through negative-stain electron microscopy and antibody-antigen binding analysis. Immunizations in guinea pigs with two-component ferritin particles, displaying diverse Env, HA, or both antigens, elicited neutralizing antibody responses against the respective viruses. The results provide proof-of-principle for the self-assembly of a two-component nanoparticle as a general technology for multimeric presentation of trimeric antigens.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1",

To induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccine-we previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric RSV F (pre-F) \"DS-Cav1\" immunogen, which induced high titer RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in mice and non-human primates, when formulated with adjuvants Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC), respectively. To assess the impact of different adjuvants, here we formulated RSV F DS-Cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses. Very high RSV-neutralizing antibody responses (19,006 EC50) were observed in na\u00efve mice immunized with 2 doses of DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Sigma adjuvant system (SAS), an oil-in-water adjuvant, plus Carbopol; high responses (3658-7108) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, SAS alone, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC); and moderate responses (1251-2129) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA or AddaVax. In contrast, DS-Cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses (6). A balanced IgG1 and IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups (all but Alum and Adjuplex). We also tested the immune response induced by DS-Cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing DS-Cav1 immunity; we observed that DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold, whereas DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold. Finally, we tested whether a mixture of ISA 71 VG and Carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in DS-Cav1 immunized calves. While pre-F-stabilized bovine RSV F induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol, the addition of Carbopol to ISA 71 VG did not enhance immune responses in calves. The vaccine response to pre-F-stabilized RSV F is augmented by adjuvant, but the degree of adjuvant-induced enhancement appears to be both context-dependent and species-specific.", "Keywords": [],

Recently, promising human RSV-vaccine candidates have been engineered that stabilize the metastable fusion (F) glycoprotein in its prefusion state; however, the absence of a relevant animal model for human RSV has complicated assessment of these vaccine candidates. Here, we use a combination of structure-based design, antigenic characterization, and X-ray crystallography to translate human RSV F stabilization into the bovine context. A \"DS2\" version of bovine respiratory syncytial virus F with subunits covalently fused, fusion peptide removed, and pre-fusion conformation stabilized by cavity-filling mutations and intra- and inter-protomer disulfides was recognized by pre-fusion-specific antibodies, AM14, D25, and MPE8, and elicited bovine respiratory syncytial virus-neutralizing titers in calves >100-fold higher than those elicited by post-fusion F. When challenged with a heterologous bovine respiratory syncytial virus, virus was not detected in nasal secretions nor in respiratory tract samples of DS2-immunized calves; by contrast bovine respiratory syncytial virus was detected in all post-fusion- and placebo-immunized calves. Our results demonstrate proof-of-concept that DS2-stabilized RSV F immunogens can induce highly protective immunity from RSV in a native host with implications for the efficacy of prefusion-stabilized F vaccines in humans and for the prevention of bovine respiratory syncytial virus in calves.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Silacci", "Affiliation": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Thom", "Affiliation": "The Pirbright Institute, Ash Road, Pirbright, Woking, Surrey GU24 0NF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey C", "Last Name": "Boyington", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksandr", "Last Name": "Druz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Efrain", "Last Name": "Guzman", "Affiliation": "The Pirbright Institute, Ash Road, Pirbright, Woking, Surrey GU24 0NF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Wing-Pui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yen-Ting", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillaume B E", "Last Name": "Stewart-Jones", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Baxa", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Corti", "Affiliation": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Lanzavecchia", "Affiliation": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Geraldine", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "The Pirbright Institute, Ash Road, Pirbright, Woking, Surrey GU24 0NF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "Journal": "NPJ vaccines", "PubDate": "2017Mar08"}, {"PMID": "28931639", "Title": "Trispecific broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies mediate potent SHIV protection in macaques.", "Abstract": "The development of an effective AIDS vaccine has been challenging because of viral genetic diversity and the difficulty of generating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs).

Network analysis showed that highly conserved glycans combined with protomer scissoring to restrict access to the binding site of the CD4 receptor. The network property of betweenness centrality appeared to identify whether glycans spread to restrict access or cluster to maintain the high-mannose character of the shield.

most prevalent worldwide cause of severe respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) also causes severe pediatric respiratory illness, especially croup. Both viruses lack vaccines. Here, we describe the preclinical development of a bivalent RSV/HPIV1 vaccine based on a recombinant HPIV1 vector, attenuated by a stabilized mutation, that expresses RSV F protein modified for increased stability in the prefusion (pre-F) conformation by previously described disulfide bond (DS) and hydrophobic cavity-filling (Cav1) mutations. RSV F was expressed from the first or second gene position as the full-length protein or as a chimeric protein with its transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail (TMCT) domains substituted with those of HPIV1 F in an effort to direct packaging in the vector particles. All constructs were recovered by reverse genetics. The TMCT versions of RSV F were packaged in the rHPIV1 particles much more efficiently than their full-length counterparts. In hamsters, the presence of the RSV F gene, and in particular the TMCT versions, was attenuating and resulted in reduced immunogenicity. However, the vector expressing full-length RSV F from the pre-N position was immunogenic for RSV and HPIV1. It conferred complement-independent high-quality RSV-neutralizing antibodies at titers similar to those of wild-type RSV and provided protection against RSV challenge. The vectors exhibited stable RSV F expression in vitro and in vivo In conclusion, an attenuated rHPIV1 vector expressing a pre-F-stabilized form of RSV F demonstrated promising immunogenicity and should be further developed as an intranasal pediatric vaccine.IMPORTANCE RSV and HPIV1 are major viral causes of acute pediatric respiratory illness for which no vaccines or suitable antiviral drugs are available. The RSV F glycoprotein is the major RSV neutralization antigen. We used a rHPIV1 vector, bearing a stabilized attenuating mutation, to express the RSV F glycoprotein bearing amino acid substitutions that increase its stability in the pre-F form, the most immunogenic form that elicits highly functional virus-neutralizing antibodies. RSV F was expressed from the pre-N or N-P gene position of the rHPIV1 vector as a full-length protein or as a chimeric form with its TMCT domain derived from HPIV1 F. TMCT modification greatly increased packaging of RSV F into the vector particles but also increased vector attenuation in vivo, resulting in reduced immunogenicity. In contrast, full-length RSV F expressed from the pre-N position was immunogenic, eliciting complement-independent RSV-neutralizing antibodies and providing protection against RSV challenge.", "Keywords": ["human parainfluenza virus type 1", "intranasal vaccine", "live attenuated vaccine", "mucosal vaccines", "pediatric vaccine", "prefusion F", "respiratory syncytial virus", "vaccine"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Mesocricetus", "Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human", "Recombinant Proteins", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines", "Respiratory Syncytial Viruses", "Vero Cells", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Virus Assembly"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Ngwuta", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xueqiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Surman", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Lingemann", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barney S", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shirin", "Last Name": "Munir", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA munirs@niaid.nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2017Nov15"}, {"PMID": "28825711", "Title": "Crystal structures of trimeric HIV envelope with entry inhibitors BMS-378806 and BMS-626529.", "Abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike is a conformational machine that transitions between prefusion (closed, CD4- and CCR5-bound) and postfusion states to facilitate HIV-1 entry into cells.

"Abstract": "Antigenic drift and shift of influenza strains underscore the need for broadly protective influenza vaccines. One strategy is to design immunogens that elicit B cell responses against conserved epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) stem. To better understand the elicitation of HA stem-targeted B cells to group 1 and group 2 influenza subtypes, we compared the memory B cell response to group 2 H7N9 and group 1 H5N1 vaccines in humans. Upon H7N9 vaccination, almost half of the HA stem-specific response recognized the group 1 and group 2 subtypes, whereas the response to H5N1 was largely group 1-specific. Immunoglobulin repertoire analysis of HA-specific B cells indicated that the H7N9 and H5N1 vaccines induced genetically similar cross-group HA stem-binding B cells, albeit at a much higher frequency upon H7N9 vaccination. These data suggest that a group 2-based stem immunogen could prove more effective than a group 1 immunogen at eliciting broad cross-group protection in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [],

antibodies.", "Abstract": "Variable regions of Ig chains provide the antigen recognition portion of B-cell receptors and derivative antibodies. Ig heavy-chain variable region exons are assembled developmentally from V, D, J gene segments. Each variable region contains three antigen-contacting complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), with CDR1 and CDR2 encoded by the V segment and CDR3 encoded by the V(D)J junction region. Antigen-stimulated germinal center (GC) B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) of V(D)J exons followed by selection for SHMs that increase antigen-binding affinity. Some HIV-1-infected human subjects develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), such as the potent VRC01-class bnAbs, that neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains. Mature VRC01-class bnAbs, including VRC-PG04, accumulate very high SHM levels, a property that hinders development of vaccine strategies to elicit them. Because many VRC01-class bnAb SHMs are not required for broad neutralization, high overall SHM may be required to achieve certain functional SHMs. To elucidate such requirements, we used a V(D)J passenger allele system to assay, in mouse GC B cells, sequence-intrinsic SHM-targeting rates of nucleotides across substrates representing maturation stages of human VRC-PG04. We identify rate-limiting SHM positions for VRC-PG04 maturation, as well as SHM hotspots and intrinsically frequent deletions associated with SHM. We find that mature VRC-PG04 has low SHM capability due to hotspot saturation but also demonstrate that generation of new SHM hotspots and saturation of existing hotspot regions (e.g., CDR3) does not majorly influence intrinsic SHM in unmutated portions of VRC-PG04 progenitor sequences.

Previous studies have shown that the propensity to mutate is modulated by the context of surrounding nucleotides and that SHM machinery generates biased substitutions. To investigate the intrinsic mutation frequency and substitution bias of SHMs at the amino acid level, we analyzed functional human antibody repertoires and developed mGSSP (method for gene-specific substitution profile), a method to construct amino acid substitution profiles from next-generation sequencing-determined B cell transcripts. We demonstrated that these gene-specific substitution profiles (GSSPs) are unique to each V gene and highly consistent between donors. We also showed that the GSSPs constructed from functional antibody repertoires are highly similar to those constructed from antibody sequences amplified from non-productively rearranged passenger alleles, which do not undergo functional selection. This suggests the types and frequencies, or mutational space, of a majority of amino acid changes sampled by the SHM machinery to be well captured by GSSPs. We further observed the rates of mutational exchange between some amino acids to be both asymmetric and context dependent and to correlate weakly with their biochemical properties. GSSPs provide an improved, position-dependent alternative to standard substitution matrices, and can be utilized to developing software for accurately modeling the SHM process. GSSPs can also be used for predicting the amino acid mutational space available for antigen-driven selection and for understanding factors modulating the maturation pathways of antibody lineages in a gene-specific context. The mGSSP method can be used to build, compare, and plot GSSPs; we report the GSSPs constructed for 69 common human V genes (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511083) and provide high-resolution logo plots for each (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511085).", "Keywords": ["B cell ontogeny", "antibodyomics", "broadly neutralizing antibody", "mutation frequency", "repertoire diversity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28539444", "Title": "Improved Prefusion Stability, Optimized Codon Usage, and Augmented Virion Packaging Enhance the Immunogenicity of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion Protein in a Vectored-Vaccine Candidate.", "Abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide, but it lacks a licensed vaccine or suitable antiviral drug. A live attenuated chimeric bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 (rB/HPIV3) was developed previously as a vector expressing RSV fusion (F) protein to confer bivalent protection against RSV and HPIV3. In a previous clinical trial in virus-naive children, rB/HPIV3 was well tolerated but the immunogenicity of wild-type RSV F was unsatisfactory. We previously modified RSV F with a designed disulfide bond (DS) to increase stability in the prefusion (pre-F) conformation and to be efficiently packaged in the vector virion. Here, we further stabilized pre-F by adding both disulfide and cavity-filling mutations (DS-Cav1), and we also modified RSV F codon usage to have a lower CpG content and a higher level of expression. This RSV F open reading frame was evaluated in rB/HPIV3 in three forms: (i) pre-F without vector-packaging signal, (ii) pre-F with vector-packaging signal, and (iii) secreted pre-F ectodomain trimer. Despite being efficiently expressed, the secreted pre-F was poorly immunogenic. DS-Cav1 stabilized pre-F, with or without packaging, induced higher titers of pre-F specific antibodies in hamsters, and improved the quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies. Codon-optimized RSV F containing fewer CpG dinucleotides had higher F expression, replicated more efficiently in vivo, and was more immunogenic. The combination of DS-Cav1 pre-F stabilization, optimized codon usage, reduced CpG content, and vector packaging significantly improved vector immunogenicity and protective efficacy against RSV. This provides an improved vectored RSV vaccine candidate suitable for pediatric clinical evaluation.IMPORTANCE RSV and HPIV3 are the first and second leading viral causes of severe pediatric respiratory disease worldwide. Licensed vaccines or suitable antiviral drugs are not available. We are developing a chimeric rB/HPIV3 vector expressing RSV F as a bivalent RSV/HPIV3 vaccine and have been evaluating means to increase RSV F immunogenicity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of improved stabilization of F in the pre-F conformation and of codon optimization resulting in reduced CpG content and greater pre-F expression. Reduced CpG content dampened the interferon response to infection, promoting higher replication and increased F expression. We demonstrate that improved pre-F stabilization and strategic manipulation of codon usage, together with efficient pre-F packaging into vector virions, significantly increased F immunogenicity in the bivalent RSV/HPIV3 vaccine. The improved immunogenicity included induction of increased titers of high-quality complement-independent antibodies with greater pre-F site \u00d8 binding and greater protection against RSV

As antibodies with loops of requisite length are created through uncommon recombination events, an alternative mode of apex binding has been sought. Here, we isolated a lineage of Env apex-directed neutralizing antibodies, N90-VRC38.01-11, by using virus-like particles and conformationally stabilized Env trimers as B cell probes. A crystal structure of N90-VRC38.01 with a scaffolded V1V2 revealed a binding mode involving side-chain-to-side-chain interactions that reduced the distance the antibody loop must traverse the glycan shield, thereby facilitating V1V2 binding via a non-protruding loop. The N90-VRC38 lineage thus identifies a solution for V1V2-apex binding that provides a more conventional B cell pathway for vaccine design.", "Keywords": ["B cell ontogeny", "CDRH3", "HIV", "NAb",

"Title": "Structure-Based Design of a Soluble Prefusion-Closed HIV-1 Env Trimer with Reduced CD4 Affinity and Improved Immunogenicity.", "Abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer is a target for vaccine design as well as a conformational machine that facilitates virus entry by transitioning between prefusion-closed, CD4-bound, and coreceptor-bound conformations by transitioning into a postfusion state. Vaccine designers have sought to restrict the conformation of the HIV-1 Env trimer to its prefusion-closed state as this state is recognized by most broadly neutralizing, but not nonneutralizing, antibodies. We previously identified a disulfide bond, I201C-A433C (DS), which stabilizes Env in the vaccine-desired prefusion-closed state. When placed into the context of BG505 SOSIP.664, a soluble Env trimer mimic developed by Sanders, Moore, and colleagues, the engineered DS-SOSIP trimer showed reduced conformational triggering by CD4. Here, we further stabilize DS-SOSIP through a combination of structure-based design and 96-well-based expression and antigenic assessment. From 103 designs, we identified one, named DS-SOSIP.4mut, with four additional mutations at the interface of potentially mobile domains of the prefusion-closed structure. We also determined the crystal structures of DS-SOSIP.4mut at 4.1-\u00c5 resolution and of an additional DS-SOSIP.6mut variant at 4.3-\u00c5 resolution, and these confirmed the formation of engineered disulfide bonds. Notably, DS-SOSIP.4mut elicited a higher ratio of tier 2 autologous titers versus tier 1 V3-sensitive titers than BG505 SOSIP.664. DS-SOSIP.4mut also showed reduced recognition of CD4 and increased thermostability. The improved antigenicity, thermostability, and immunogenicity of DS-SOSIP.4mut suggest utility as an immunogen or a serologic probe; moreover, the specific four alterations identified here, M154, M300, M302, and L320 (4mut), can also be transferred to other HIV-1 Env trimers of interest to improve their properties.IMPORTANCE One approach to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 is to stabilize the structurally flexible HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer in a conformation that displays predominantly broadly neutralizing epitopes and few to no nonneutralizing epitopes. The prefusion-closed conformation of HIV-1 Env has been identified as one such preferred conformation, and a current leading vaccine candidate is the BG505 DS-SOSIP variant, comprising two disulfides and an Ile-to-Pro mutation of Env from strain BG505. Here, we introduced additional mutations to further stabilize BG505 DS-SOSIP in the vaccine-preferred prefusion-closed conformation. In guinea pigs, our best mutant, DS-SOSIP.4mut, elicited a significantly higher ratio of autologous versus V3-directed neutralizing antibody responses than the SOSIP-stabilized form. We also observed an improvement in thermostability and a reduction in CD4 affinity. With improved antigenicity, stability, and immunogenicity, DS-SOSIP.4mut-stabilized trimers may have utility as HIV-1 immunogens or in other antigen-specific contexts, such as with B-cell probes.",

The X-ray structure of a similar compound, NBD-14010, confirmed the binding mode of the newly designed compounds. The in vitro ADMET profiles of these compounds are comparable to that of the most potent attachment inhibitor BMS-626529, a prodrug of which is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials.

We previously identified a participant in the CAPRISA cohort, CAP248, who developed trimer-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing 60% of heterologous viruses at three years post-infection. Here, we report the isolation by B cell culture of monoclonal antibody CAP248-2B, which targets a novel membrane proximal epitope including elements of gp120 and gp41. Despite low maximum inhibition plateaus, often below 50% inhibitory concentrations, the breadth of CAP248-2B significantly correlated with donor plasma. Site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and negative-stain electron microscopy 3D reconstructions revealed how CAP248-2B recognizes a cleavage-dependent epitope that includes the gp120 C terminus. While this epitope is distinct, it overlapped in parts of gp41 with the epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies PGT151, VRC34, 35O22, 3BC315, and 10E8. CAP248-2B has a conformationally variable paratope with an unusually long 19 amino acid light chain third complementarity determining region. Two phenylalanines at the loop apex were predicted by docking and mutagenesis data to interact with the viral membrane. Neutralization by CAP248-2B is not dependent on any single glycan proximal to its epitope, and low neutralization plateaus could not be completely explained by N- or O-linked glycosylation pathway inhibitors, furin co-transfection, or pre-incubation with soluble CD4. Viral escape from CAP248-2B involved a cluster of rare mutations in the gp120-gp41 cleavage sites. Simultaneous introduction of these mutations into heterologous viruses abrogated neutralization by CAP248-2B, but enhanced neutralization sensitivity to 35O22, 4E10, and 10E8 by 10-100-fold. Altogether, this study expands the region of the HIV-1 gp120-gp41 quaternary interface that is a target for broadly neutralizing antibodies and identifies a set of mutations in the gp120 C terminus that exposes the membrane-proximal external region of gp41, with potential utility in HIV vaccine design.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing",

neutralization fingerprinting, NFP, is an efficient and accurate method for predicting the epitope specificities of polyclonal antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. Here, we present next-generation NFP algorithms that substantially improve prediction accuracy for individual donors and enable serologic analysis for entire cohorts. Specifically, we developed algorithms for: (a) selection of optimized virus neutralization panels for NFP analysis, (b) estimation of NFP prediction confidence for each serum sample, and (c) identification of sera with potentially novel epitope specificities. At the individual donor level, the next-generation NFP algorithms particularly improved the ability to detect multiple epitope specificities in a sample, as confirmed both for computationally simulated polyclonal sera and for samples from HIV-infected donors. Specifically, the next-generation NFP algorithms detected multiple specificities in twice as many samples of simulated sera. Further, unlike the first-generation NFP, the new algorithms were able to detect both of the previously confirmed antibody specificities, VRC01-like and PG9-like, in donor CHAVI 0219. At the cohort level, analysis of ~150 broadly neutralizing HIV-infected donor samples suggested a potential connection between clade of infection and types of elicited epitope specificities. Most notably, while 10E8-like antibodies were observed in infections from different clades, an enrichment of such antibodies was predicted for clade B samples. Ultimately, such large-scale analyses of antibody responses to HIV-1 infection can help guide the design of epitope-specific vaccines that are tailored to take into account the prevalence of infecting clades within a specific geographic region.

However, despite substantial efforts, no generally applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine.

The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2=0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction.

An unexpectedly high fraction of serum antibodies recognized both the H1 and H3 monovalent vaccines. Recombinant versions of these H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad binding to hemagglutinins (HAs) from previously circulating virus strains; several of these antibodies, which were prevalent in the serum of multiple donors, recognized the same conserved epitope in the HA head domain. Although the HA-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show neutralization activity in vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains when administered before or after challenge.

"Abstract": "All HIV-1-infected individuals develop strain-specific neutralizing antibodies to their infecting virus, which in some cases mature into broadly neutralizing antibodies. Defining the epitopes of strain-specific antibodies that overlap conserved sites of vulnerability might provide mechanistic insights into how broadly neutralizing antibodies arise. We previously described an HIV-1 clade C-infected donor, CAP257, who developed broadly neutralizing plasma antibodies targeting an N276 glycan-dependent epitope in the CD4 binding site. The initial CD4 binding site response potently neutralized the heterologous tier 2 clade B viral strain RHPA, which was used to design resurfaced gp120 antigens for single-B-cell sorting. Here we report the isolation and structural characterization of CAP257-RH1, an N276 glycan-dependent CD4 binding site antibody representative of the early CD4 binding site plasma response in donor CAP257. The cocrystal structure of CAP257-RH1 bound to RHPA gp120 revealed critical interactions with the N276 glycan, loop D, and V5, but not with aspartic acid 368, similarly to HJ16 and 179NC75. The CAP257-RH1 monoclonal antibody was derived from the immunoglobulin-variable IGHV3-33 and IGLV3-10 genes and neutralized RHPA but not the transmitted/founder virus from donor CAP257. Its narrow neutralization breadth was attributed to a binding angle that was incompatible with glycosylated V5 loops present in almost all HIV-1 strains, including the CAP257 transmitted/founder virus. Deep sequencing of autologous CAP257 viruses, however, revealed minority variants early in infection that lacked V5 glycans. These glycan-free V5 loops are unusual holes in the glycan shield that may have been necessary for initiating this N276 glycan-dependent CD4 binding site B-cell lineage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies, Blocking", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "Binding Sites, Antibody", "CD4 Antigens", "Cell Line", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Epitopes", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Polysaccharides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Constantinos Kurt", "Last Name": "Wibmer", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin S", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Nonhlanhla N", "Last Name": "Mkhize", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksandr", "Last Name": "Druz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Talita", "Last Name": "York", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Labuschagne", "Affiliation": "South African National Bioinformatics Institute, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert T", "Last Name": "Bailer", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Salim S", "Last Name": "Abdool Karim", "Affiliation": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn", "Last Name": "Williamson", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Penny L", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA pdkwong@nih.gov lynnm@nicd.ac.za."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa pdkwong@nih.gov lynnm@nicd.ac.za."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2016Nov15"}, {"PMID": "27583777", "Title": "Thermoresponsive Polymer Nanoparticles Co-deliver RSV F Trimers with a TLR-7/8 Adjuvant.", "Abstract": "Structure-based vaccine design has been used to develop immunogens that display conserved neutralization sites on pathogens such as HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza.

detail, and these developments have triggered a proliferation of software tools for processing and annotating these data. Of especial interest, however, is the capability to track the development of specific antibody lineages across time, which remains beyond the scope of most current programs. We have previously reported on the use of techniques such as inter- and intradonor analysis and CDR3 tracing to identify transcripts related to an antibody of interest. Here, we present Software for the Ontogenic aNalysis of Antibody Repertoires (SONAR), capable of automating both general repertoire analysis and specialized techniques for investigating specific lineages. SONAR annotates next-generation sequencing data, identifies transcripts in a lineage of interest, and tracks lineage development across multiple time points. SONAR also generates figures, such as identity-divergence plots and longitudinal phylogenetic \"birthday\" trees, and provides interfaces to other programs such as DNAML and BEAST. SONAR can be downloaded as a ready-to-run Docker image or manually installed on a local machine. In the latter case, it can also be configured to take advantage of a high-performance computing cluster for the most computationally intensive steps, if available. In summary, this software provides a useful new tool for the processing of large next-generation sequencing datasets and the ontogenic analysis of neutralizing antibody lineages.

A chimeric bovine/human PIV3 (rB/HPIV3) virus expressing the unmodified, wild-type (wt) RSV fusion (F) protein from an added gene was previously evaluated in seronegative children as a bivalent intranasal RSV/HPIV3 vaccine, and it was well tolerated but insufficiently immunogenic for RSV F. We recently showed that rB/HPIV3 expressing a partially stabilized prefusion form (pre-F) of RSV F efficiently induced \"high-quality\" RSV-neutralizing antibodies, defined as antibodies that neutralize RSV in vitro without added complement (B. Liang et al., J Virol 89:9499-9510, 2015, doi:10.1128/JVI.01373-15). In the present study, we modified RSV F by replacing its cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain or its CT and transmembrane (TM) domains (TMCT) with counterparts from BPIV3 F, with or without pre-F stabilization. This resulted in RSV F being packaged in the rB/HPIV3 particle with an efficiency similar to that of RSV particles. Enhanced packaging was substantially attenuating in hamsters (10- to 100-fold) and rhesus monkeys (100- to 1,000-fold). Nonetheless, TMCT-directed packaging substantially increased the titers of high-quality RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies in hamsters. In rhesus monkeys, a strongly additive immunogenic effect of packaging and pre-F stabilization was observed, as demonstrated by 8- and 30-fold increases of RSV-neutralizing serum antibody titers in the presence and absence of added complement, respectively, compared to pre-F stabilization alone. Analysis of vaccine-induced F-specific antibodies by binding assays indicated that packaging conferred substantial stabilization of RSV F in the pre-F conformation. This provides an improved version of this well-tolerated RSV/HPIV3 vaccine candidate, with potently improved immunogenicity, which can be returned to clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

Two reports suggested that gB binds to ErbB1 and PDGFR\u03b1 (refs 6,7); however, these results do not explain the tropism of the virus and were recently challenged(8,9). Here, we provide a 19\u2005\u00c5 reconstruction for the gHgLgO trimer and show that it binds with high affinity through the gO subunit to PDGFR\u03b1, which is expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells. We also provide evidence that the trimer is essential for viral entry in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, we identify the pentamer, which is essential for infection of epithelial cells, as a trigger for the ErbB pathway.

maturation enhance antigen recognition by modifying antibody paratope structure to improve its complementarity with the target epitope. SHM-induced changes in paratope dynamics may also contribute to antibody maturation, but direct evidence of this is limited. Here, we examine two classes of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for SHM-induced changes in structure and dynamics, and delineate the effects of these changes on interactions with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). In combination with new and existing structures of unmutated and affinity matured antibody Fab fragments, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry to directly measure Fab structural dynamics. Changes in antibody structure and dynamics were positioned to improve complementarity with Env, with changes in dynamics primarily observed at the\u00a0paratope peripheries.

Although no licensed vaccine is currently available, an engineered version of the metastable RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein-stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation by \"DS-Cav1\" mutations-elicits high titer RSV-neutralizing responses. Moreover, pre-F-specific antibodies, often against the neutralization-sensitive antigenic site \u00d8 in the membrane-distal head region of trimeric F glycoprotein, comprise a substantial portion of the human response to natural RSV infection. To focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00d8, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens that comprised the membrane-distal head of the F glycoprotein in its pre-F conformation. These \"head-only\" immunogens formed monomers, dimers, and trimers. Antigenic analysis revealed that a majority of the 70 engineered head-only immunogens displayed reactivity to site \u00d8-targeting antibodies, which was similar to that of the parent RSV F DS-Cav1 trimers, often with increased thermostability. We evaluated four of these head-only immunogens in detail, probing their recognition by antibodies, their physical stability, structure, and immunogenicity. When tested in na\u00efve mice, a head-only trimer, half the size of the parent RSV F trimer, induced RSV titers, which were statistically comparable to those induced by DS-Cav1. When used to boost DS-Cav1-primed mice, two head-only RSV F immunogens, a dimer and a trimer, boosted RSV-neutralizing titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by DS-Cav1, although with higher site \u00d8-directed responses. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the ability of the smaller head-only RSV F immunogens to focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00d8. Decent primary immunogenicity, enhanced physical stability, potential ease of manufacture, and potent immunogenicity upon boosting suggest these head-only RSV F immunogens, engineered to retain the pre-fusion conformation, may have advantages as candidate RSV vaccines.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Viral", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunogenicity, Vaccine",

The developmental pathway of 10E8 might therefore serve as a promising template for vaccine design, but samples from time-of-infection-often used to infer the B cell record-are unavailable. In this study, we used crystallography, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and functional assessments to infer the 10E8 developmental pathway from a single time point. Mutational analysis indicated somatic hypermutation of the 2nd-heavy chain-complementarity determining region (CDR H2) to be critical for neutralization, and structures of 10E8 variants with V-gene regions reverted to genomic origin for heavy-and-light chains or heavy chain-only showed structural differences >2 \u00c5 relative to mature 10E8 in the CDR H2 and H3. To understand these developmental changes, we used bioinformatic sieving, maximum likelihood, and parsimony analyses of immunoglobulin transcripts to identify 10E8-lineage members, to infer the 10E8-unmutated common ancestor (UCA), and to calculate 10E8-developmental intermediates. We were assisted in this analysis by the preservation of a critical D-gene segment, which was unmutated in most 10E8-lineage sequences.

We hypothesized that inefficient Env binding to rhesus CD4 (rhCD4) limits virus entry and replication and could be enhanced by substituting naturally occurring simian immunodeficiency virus Env residues at position 375, which resides at a critical location in the CD4-binding pocket and is under strong positive evolutionary pressure across the broad spectrum of primate lentiviruses. SHIVs containing primary or transmitted/founder HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, or D Envs with genotypic variants at residue 375 were constructed and analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Bulky hydrophobic or basic amino acids substituted for serine-375 enhanced Env affinity for rhCD4, virus entry into cells bearing rhCD4, and virus replication in primary rhCD4 T cells without appreciably affecting antigenicity or antibody-mediated neutralization sensitivity. Twenty-four RMs inoculated with subtype A, B, C, or D SHIVs all became productively infected with different Env375 variants-S, M, Y, H, W, or F-that were differentially selected in different Env backbones. Notably, SHIVs replicated persistently at titers comparable to HIV-1 in humans and elicited autologous neutralizing antibody responses typical of HIV-1. Seven animals succumbed to AIDS. These findings identify Env-rhCD4 binding as a critical determinant for productive SHIV infection in RMs and validate a novel and generalizable strategy for constructing SHIVs with Env glycoproteins

Infection.", "Abstract": "Accumulation of somatic mutations in antibody variable regions is critical for antibody affinity maturation, with HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) generally requiring years to develop. We recently found that the rate at which mutations accumulate decreases over time, but the mechanism governing this slowing is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether natural selection and/or mutability of the antibody variable region contributed significantly to observed decrease in rate. We used longitudinally sampled sequences of immunoglobulin transcripts of single lineages from each of 3 donors, as determined by next generation sequencing. We estimated the evolutionary rates of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which are most significant for functional selection, and found they evolved about 1.5- to 2- fold faster than the framework regions. We also analyzed the presence of AID hotspots and coldspots at different points in lineage development and observed an average decrease in mutability of less than 10 percent over time. Altogether, the correlation between Darwinian selection strength and evolutionary rate trended toward significance, especially for CDRs, but cannot fully explain the observed changes in evolutionary rate. The mutability modulated by AID hotspots and coldspots changes correlated only weakly with evolutionary rates. The combined effects of Darwinian selection and mutability contribute substantially to, but do not fully explain, evolutionary rate change for HIV-1-targeting bnAb lineages.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibody Affinity", "Complementarity Determining Regions", "Computational Biology", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes, Immunoglobulin", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Variable Region", "Longitudinal Studies", "Models, Genetic", "Models, Immunological", "Mutation", "Selection, Genetic", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Center for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "27174988", "Title": "Fusion peptide of HIV-1 as a site of vulnerability to neutralizing antibody.", "Abstract": "The HIV-1 fusion peptide, comprising 15 to 20 hydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the Env-gp41 subunit, is a critical component of the virus-cell entry machinery.

However, knowledge of the structure of the SIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein is limited, as is knowledge of binding specificity, function and potential efficacy of SIV antibody responses. In this study we describe the use of a competitive probe binding sort strategy as well as scaffolded probes for targeted isolation of SIV Env-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We isolated nearly 70 SIV-specific mAbs directed against major sites of SIV Env vulnerability analogous to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) targets of HIV-1, namely, the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), CD4-induced (CD4i)-site, peptide epitopes in variable loops 1, 2 and 3 (V1, V2, V3) and potentially glycan targets of SIV Env. The range of SIV mAbs isolated includes those exhibiting varying degrees of neutralization breadth and potency as well as others that demonstrated binding but not neutralization. Several SIV mAbs displayed broad and potent neutralization of a diverse panel of 20 SIV viral isolates with some also neutralizing HIV-2(7312A). This extensive panel of SIV mAbs will facilitate more effective use of the SIV non-human primate (NHP) model for understanding the variables in development of a HIV vaccine or immunotherapy.",

"Extraordinary antibodies capable of near pan-neutralization of HIV-1 have been identified. One of the broadest is antibody 10E8, which recognizes the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope and neutralizes >95% of circulating HIV-1 strains. If delivered passively, 10E8 might serve to prevent or treat HIV-1 infection. Antibody 10E8, however, is markedly less soluble than other antibodies. Here, we describe the use of both structural biology and somatic variation to develop optimized versions of 10E8 with increased solubility. From the structure of 10E8, we identified a prominent hydrophobic patch; reversion of four hydrophobic residues in this patch to their hydrophilic germ line counterparts resulted in an \u223c10-fold decrease in turbidity. We also used somatic variants of 10E8, identified previously by next-generation sequencing, to optimize heavy and light chains; this process yielded several improved variants. Of these, variant 10E8v4 with 26 changes versus the parent 10E8 was the most soluble, with a paratope we showed crystallographically to be virtually identical to that of 10E8, a potency on a panel of 200 HIV-1 isolates also similar to that of 10E8, and a half-life in rhesus macaques of \u223c10 days. An anomaly in 10E8v4 size exclusion chromatography that appeared to be related to conformational isomerization was resolved by engineering an interchain disulfide. Thus, by combining a structure-based approach with natural variation in potency and solubility from the 10E8 lineage, we successfully created variants of 10E8 which retained the potency and extraordinary neutralization breadth of the parent 10E8 but with substantially increased solubility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Chemistry Techniques,

Here, we have developed a glycan microarray on an aluminium-oxide-coated glass slide containing a diverse set of glycans, including homo- and mixed N-glycans (high-mannose, hybrid and complex types) that were prepared by modular chemo-enzymatic methods to detect the presence of hetero-glycan binding behaviours.

One of the most promising antigenic and structural mimics of HIV-1 Env is the SOSIP.664-stabilized soluble trimer from the clade A strain BG505, which is preferentially recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Trimer immunization elicits high-titer neutralization of the autologous tier 2 BG505 strain; however, breadth is limited, and substantial interest has focused on understanding and improving trimer immunogenicity. We sought to improve the antigenic specificity of BG505 SOSIP.664 by reducing recognition of the variable loop 3 (V3) region, which elicits only weakly neutralizing antibodies. To stabilize the trimer in its prefusion closed conformation, we complexed trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664 with the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of PGT145, a broadly neutralizing quaternary-structure-specific antibody. Compared to the ligand-free trimer, the PGT145 Fab-BG505 SOSIP.664 complex displayed increased melting temperature stability and reduced V3 recognition. In guinea pigs, immunization with the PGT145 Fab-BG505 SOSIP.664 complex elicited \u223c100-fold lower V3-directed binding and neutralization titers than those obtained with ligand-free BG505 SOSIP.664. Both complexed and ligand-free BG505 SOSIP.664 elicited comparable neutralization of the autologous BG505 virus, and in both cases, BG505 neutralization mapped to the outer domain of gp120 for some guinea pigs. Our results indicate that it is possible to reduce immune recognition of the V3 region of the trimer while maintaining the antigenic profile needed to induce autologous neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that appropriate modifications of trimer immunogens could further focus the immune response on key neutralization epitopes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Guinea Pigs", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV-1", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Stability", "Transition Temperature", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Pancera", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Bossert", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rita E", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksandr", "Last Name": "Druz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandeep", "Last Name": "Narpala", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adrian B", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA pdkwong@nih.gov jmascola@mail.nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA pdkwong@nih.gov jmascola@mail.nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2015Dec30"}, {"PMID": "26689967", "Title": "Structures of HIV-1 Env V1V2 with broadly neutralizing antibodies reveal commonalities that enable vaccine design.", "Abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 Env V1V2 arise in multiple donors.

These V1V2-directed bNAbs used strand-strand interactions between a protruding antibody loop and a V1V2 strand but differed in their N-glycan recognition. Ontogeny analysis indicated that protruding loops develop early, and glycan interactions mature over time. Altogether, the multidonor information suggested that V1V2-directed bNAbs form an 'extended class', for which we engineered ontogeny-specific antigens: Env trimers with chimeric V1V2s that interacted with inferred ancestor and intermediate antibodies.

Here we report an approach to reduce the viral reservoir by activating dormant viral gene expression and directing T lymphocytes to lyse previously latent, HIV-1-infected cells. An immunomodulatory protein was created that combines the specificity of a HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody with that of an antibody to the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor. CD3 engagement by the protein can stimulate T-cell activation that induces proviral gene expression in latently infected T cells. It further stimulates CD8 T-cell effector function and redirects T cells to lyse these previously latent-infected cells through recognition of newly expressed Env.

Exceptional Potency.", "Abstract": "The epitopes defined by HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are valuable templates for vaccine design, and studies of the immunological development of these antibodies are providing insights for vaccination strategies. In addition, the most potent and broadly reactive of these bNAbs have potential for clinical use. We previously described a family of 12 V1V2-directed neutralizing antibodies, CAP256-VRC26, isolated from an HIV-1 clade C-infected donor at years 1, 2, and 4 of infection (N. A. Doria-Rose et al., Nature 509:55-62, 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13036). Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of new members of the family mostly obtained at time points of peak serum neutralization breadth and potency. Thirteen antibodies were isolated from B cell culture, and eight were isolated using trimeric envelope probes for differential single B cell sorting. One of the new antibodies displayed a 10-fold greater neutralization potency than previously published lineage members. This antibody, CAP256-VRC26.25, neutralized 57% of diverse clade viral isolates and 70% of clade C isolates with remarkable potency. Among the viruses neutralized, the median 50% inhibitory concentration was 0.001 \u03bcg/ml. All 33 lineage members targeted a quaternary epitope focused on V2. While all known bNAbs targeting the V1V2 region interact with the N160 glycan, the CAP256-VRC26 antibodies showed an inverse correlation of neutralization potency with dependence on this glycan. Overall, our results highlight the ongoing evolution within a single antibody lineage and describe more potent and broadly neutralizing members with potential clinical utility, particularly in areas where clade C is prevalent.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cross Reactions", "Epitope Mapping", "Female", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV

determine the magnitude of RSV neutralizing activity in human sera.", "Abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is estimated to claim more lives among infants <1 year old than any other single pathogen, except malaria, and poses a substantial global health burden. Viral entry is mediated by a type I fusion glycoprotein (F) that transitions from a metastable prefusion (pre-F) to a stable postfusion (post-F) trimer. A highly neutralization-sensitive epitope, antigenic site \u00d8, is found only on pre-F. We determined what fraction of neutralizing (NT) activity in human sera is dependent on antibodies specific for antigenic site \u00d8 or other antigenic sites on F in healthy subjects from ages 7 to 93 years. Adsorption of individual sera with stabilized pre-F protein removed >90% of NT activity and depleted binding antibodies to both F conformations. In contrast, adsorption with post-F removed ~30% of NT activity, and binding antibodies to pre-F were retained. These findings were consistent across all age groups. Protein competition neutralization assays with pre-F mutants in which sites \u00d8 or II were altered to knock out binding of antibodies to the corresponding sites showed that these sites accounted for ~35 and <10% of NT activity, respectively. Binding competition assays with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) indicated that the amount of site \u00d8-specific antibodies correlated with NT activity, whereas the magnitude of binding competed by site II mAbs did not correlate with neutralization. Our results indicate that RSV NT activity in human sera is primarily derived from pre-F-specific antibodies, and therefore, inducing or boosting NT activity by vaccination will be facilitated by using pre-F antigens that preserve site \u00d8.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Child", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines", "Respiratory Syncytial Viruses", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan O", "Last Name": "Ngwuta", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Man", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kayvon", "Last Name": "Modjarrad", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

In contrast, some HIV-1-infected individuals naturally mount bNAb responses during chronic infection, suggesting that years of maturation may be required for neutralization breadth. Recent studies have shown that viral diversification precedes the emergence of bNAbs, but the significance of this observation is unknown. Here we delineate the key viral events that drove neutralization breadth within the CAP256-VRC26 family of 33 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from a superinfected individual. First, we identified minority viral variants, termed bNAb-initiating envelopes, that were distinct from both of the transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses and that efficiently engaged the bNAb precursor. Second, deep sequencing revealed a pool of diverse epitope variants (immunotypes) that were preferentially neutralized by broader members of the antibody lineage. In contrast, a 'dead-end' antibody sublineage unable to neutralize these immunotypes showed limited evolution and failed to develop breadth. Thus, early viral escape at key antibody-virus contact sites selects for antibody sublineages that can tolerate these changes, thereby providing a mechanism for the generation of neutralization breadth within a developing antibody lineage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antigenic Variation", "Epitopes", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Neutralization Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "RNA, Viral", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Superinfection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinal N", "Last Name": "Bhiman", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen", "Last Name": "Karimanzira", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thandeka", "Last Name": "Khoza", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Dale", "Last Name": "Kitchin", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Botha", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nigel J", "Last Name": "Garrett", "Affiliation": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Salim S", "Last Name": "Abdool Karim", "Affiliation": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn", "Last Name": "Williamson", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Penny L", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26413851", "Title": "V1/V2 Neutralizing Epitope is Conserved in Divergent Non-M Groups of HIV-1.", "Abstract": "Highly potent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) have been obtained from individuals infected by HIV-1 group M variants.

In contrast, the immunogenically subdominant stem region of HA is highly conserved and recognized by antibodies capable of binding multiple HA subtypes. Here we report the structure-based development of an H1 HA stem-only immunogen that confers heterosubtypic protection in mice and ferrets. Six iterative cycles of structure-based design (Gen1-Gen6) yielded successive H1 HA stabilized-stem (HA-SS) immunogens that lack the immunodominant head domain. Antigenic characterization, determination of two HA-SS crystal structures in complex with stem-specific monoclonal antibodies and cryo-electron microscopy analysis of HA-SS on ferritin nanoparticles (H1-SS-np) confirmed the preservation of key structural elements. Vaccination of mice and ferrets with H1-SS-np elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies that completely protected mice and partially protected ferrets against lethal heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza virus challenge despite the absence of detectable H5N1 neutralizing activity in vitro.

virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) are the first and second leading viral agents of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. Vaccines are not available, and an RSV vaccine is particularly needed. A live attenuated chimeric recombinant bovine/human PIV3 (rB/HPIV3) vector expressing the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein from an added gene has been under development as a bivalent vaccine against RSV and HPIV3. Previous clinical evaluation of this vaccine candidate suggested that increased genetic stability and immunogenicity of the RSV F insert were needed. This was investigated in the present study. RSV F expression was enhanced 5-fold by codon optimization and by modifying the amino acid sequence to be identical to that of an early passage of the original clinical isolate. This conferred a hypofusogenic phenotype that presumably reflects the original isolate. We then compared vectors expressing stabilized prefusion and postfusion versions of RSV F. In a hamster model, prefusion F induced increased quantity and quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies and increased protection against wild-type (wt) RSV challenge. In contrast, a vector expressing the postfusion F was less immunogenic and protective. The genetic stability of the RSV F insert was high and was not affected by enhanced expression or the prefusion or postfusion conformation of RSV F. These studies provide an improved version of the previously well-tolerated rB/HPIV3-RSV F vaccine candidate that induces a superior RSV-neutralizing serum antibody response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cricetinae", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human", "Recombinant Proteins", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human", "Vero Cells", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Viral Vaccines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Surman", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emerito", "Last Name": "Amaro-Carambot", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbora", "Last Name": "Kabatova", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Mackow", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Lingemann", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason S", "Last Name": "McLellan", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barney S", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Schaap-Nutt", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shirin", "Last Name": "Munir", "Affiliation": "RNA Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA munirs@niaid.nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2015Sep"}, {"PMID": "26098893", "Title": "A Cysteine Zipper Stabilizes a Pre-Fusion F Glycoprotein Vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus.", "Abstract": "Recombinant subunit vaccines should contain minimal non-pathogen motifs to reduce potential off-target reactivity. We recently developed a vaccine antigen against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which comprised the fusion (F) glycoprotein stabilized in its pre-fusion trimeric conformation by \"DS-Cav1\" mutations and by an appended C-terminal trimerization motif or \"foldon\" from T4-bacteriophage fibritin. Here we investigate the creation of a cysteine zipper to allow for the removal of the phage foldon, while maintaining the immunogenicity of the parent DS-Cav1+foldon antigen. Constructs without foldon yielded RSV F monomers, and enzymatic removal of the phage foldon from pre-fusion F trimers resulted in their dissociation into monomers. Because the native C terminus of the pre-fusion RSV F ectodomain encompasses a viral trimeric coiled-coil, we explored whether introduction of cysteine residues capable of forming inter-protomer disulfides might allow for stable trimers. Structural modeling indicated the introduced cysteines to form disulfide \"rings\", with each ring comprising a different set of inward facing residues of the coiled-coil. Three sets of rings could be placed within the native RSV F coiled-coil, and additional rings could be added by duplicating portions of the coiled-coil. High levels of neutralizing activity in mice, equivalent to that of the parent DS-Cav1+foldon antigen, were elicited by a 4-ring stabilized RSV F trimer with no foldon. Structure-based alteration of a viral coiled-coil to create a cysteine zipper thus allows a phage trimerization motif to be removed from a candidate vaccine antigen.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antigens, Viral", "Bacteriophage T4", "Caveolin 1", "Cell Line", "Cysteine", "Immunization", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines", "Respiratory Syncytial Viruses", "Vaccines, Subunit", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Viral Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guillaume B E", "Last Name": "Stewart-Jones", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paul V", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Man", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksandr", "Last Name": "Druz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wing-Pui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mallika", "Last Name": "Sastry", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cinque", "Last Name": "Soto", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ivelin S", "Last Name": "Georgiev", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jason S", "Last Name": "McLellan", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America;

Consequently, an understanding of the molecular basis for Env epitopes that constitute effective ADCC targets is of fundamental interest for humoral anti-HIV-1 immunity and for HIV-1 vaccine design. A substantial portion of FcR effector function of potentially protective anti-HIV-1 antibodies is directed toward nonneutralizing, transitional, CD4-inducible (CD4i) epitopes associated with the gp41-reactive region of gp120 (cluster A epitopes). Our previous studies defined the A32-like epitope within the cluster A region and mapped it to the highly conserved and mobile layers 1 and 2 of the gp120 inner domain within the C1-C2 regions of gp120. Here, we elucidate additional cluster A epitope structures, including an A32-like epitope, recognized by human monoclonal antibody (MAb) N60-i3, and a hybrid A32-C11-like epitope, recognized by rhesus macaque MAb JR4. These studies define for the first time a hybrid A32-C11-like epitope and map it to elements of both the A32-like subregion and the seven-layered \u03b2-sheet of the gp41-interactive region of gp120. These studies provide additional evidence that effective antibody-dependent effector function in the cluster A region depends on precise epitope targeting--a combination of epitope footprint and mode of antibody attachment. All together these findings help further an understanding of how cluster A epitopes are targeted by humoral responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Amino Acid Sequence",

prevent lentiviral infection in nonhuman primates and may slow the spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although protection by passive transfer of human bnAbs has been demonstrated in monkeys, durable expression is essential for its broader use in humans. Gene-based expression of bnAbs provides a potential solution to this problem, although immune responses to the viral vector or to the antibody may limit its durability and efficacy. Here, we delivered an adeno-associated viral vector encoding a simianized form of a CD4bs bnAb, VRC07, and evaluated its immunogenicity and protective efficacy. The expressed antibody circulated in macaques for 16 weeks at levels up to 66 g/ml, although immune suppression with cyclosporine (CsA) was needed to sustain expression. Gene-delivered simian VRC07 protected against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in monkeys 5.5 weeks after treatment. Gene transfer of an anti-HIV antibody can therefore protect against infection by viruses that cause AIDS in primates when the host immune responses are controlled.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cyclosporine", "DNA Primers", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Macaca mulatta", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neutralization Tests", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kevin O", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lingshu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Yong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alejandro B", "Last Name": "Balazs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sung-Youl", "Last Name": "Ko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wing-Pui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca S", "Last Name": "Rudicell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivelin S", "Last Name": "Georgiev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lijie", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Foulds", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitzi", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John-Paul", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Baltimore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Roederer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashley T", "Last Name": "Haase", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Srinivas S", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gary J", "Last Name": "Nabel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2015Aug"}, {"PMID": "26023780", "Title": "Vaccine-Elicited Tier 2 HIV-1 Neutralizing Antibodies Bind to Quaternary Epitopes Involving Glycan-Deficient Patches Proximal to the CD4 Binding Site.", "Abstract": "Eliciting broad tier 2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. Here we investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit nAbs. Unusually potent nAb titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers (trimer VLP sera) and in 1 of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost (DNA trimer sera). All 3 sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes and exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. Specifically, trimer VLP sera took advantage of the unusual absence of a glycan at residue 197 (present in 98.7% of Envs). Intriguingly, removing the N197 glycan (with no loss of tier 2 phenotype) rendered 50% or 16.7% (n = 18) of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the two trimer VLP sera, showing broad neutralization via the surface masked by the N197 glycan. Neutralizing sera targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a putative \"glycan fence\" that limits access to this region. A bioinformatics analysis suggested shared features of one of the trimer VLP sera and monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with its trimer-dependency. The neutralizing DNA trimer serum took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 230, also proximal to the CD4 binding site and suggesting an epitope similar to that of monoclonal antibody 8ANC195, albeit lacking tier 2 breadth. Taken together, our data show for the first time that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. Moreover, cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. Overall, our observations provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Binding Sites", "CD4 Antigens", "Epitopes", "Female", "Guinea Pigs", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunization", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Conformation", "Rabbits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ema T", "Last Name": "Crooks", "Affiliation": "San Diego Biomedical Research Institute, San Diego, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tommy", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "San Diego Biomedical Research Institute, San Diego, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bimal", "Last Name": "Chakrabarti", "Affiliation": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center at The Scripps Research Institute, Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Narayan", "Affiliation": "Altravax, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ivelin S", "Last Name": "Georgiev", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Menis", "Affiliation": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center at The Scripps Research Institute, Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, La Jolla, California, United States of America;

Mechanistically, this Vpx activity was recently reported to involve the degradation of Sterile Alpha Motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) in this cell lineage. Here we show that when macaques were inoculated with either the T cell tropic SIVmac239 or the macrophage tropic SIVmac316 carrying a Vpx point mutation that abrogates the recruitment of DCAF1 and the ensuing degradation of endogenous SAMHD1 in cultured CD4+ T cells, virus acquisition, progeny virion production in memory CD4+ T cells during acute infection, and the maintenance of set-point viremia were greatly attenuated. Revertant viruses emerging in two animals exhibited an augmented replication phenotype in memory CD4+ T lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with reduced levels of endogenous SAMHD1. These results indicate that a critical role of Vpx in vivo is to promote the degradation of SAMHD1 in memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, thereby generating high levels of plasma viremia and the induction of

combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono- and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM.

Next-generation sequencing identified VRC01-lineage transcripts, which encompassed diverse antibodies organized into distinct phylogenetic clades. Prevalent clades maintained characteristic features of antigen recognition, though each evolved binding loops and disulfides that formed distinct recognition surfaces. Over the course of the study period, VRC01-lineage clades showed continuous evolution, with rates of \u223c2 substitutions per 100 nucleotides per year, comparable to that of HIV-1 evolution.

Here we present a method for eliminating antibody polyreactivity through the computational design and genetic addition of N-linked glycosylation near known sites of polyreactivity. We used the HIV-1-neutralizing antibody, VRC07, as a test case, since efforts to increase VRC07 potency at three spatially distinct sites resulted in enhanced polyreactivity. The addition of N-linked glycans proximal to the polyreactivity-enhancing mutations at each of the spatially distinct sites resulted in reduced antibody polyreactivity as measured by (i) anti-cardiolipin ELISA, (ii) Luminex AtheNA Multi-Lyte ANA binding, and (iii) HEp-2 cell staining. The reduced polyreactivity trended with increased antibody concentration over time in mice, but not with improved overall protein stability as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, glycan proximity to the site of polyreactivity appeared to be a critical factor. The results provide evidence that antibody polyreactivity can result from local, rather than global, features of an antibody and that addition of N-linked glycosylation can be an effective approach to

many viral infections and can potentially prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. However, neutralizing antibodies have so far only been shown to protect nonhuman primates (NHP) against lentiviral infection when given shortly before challenge. Thus, the clinical utility and feasibility of passive antibody transfer to confer long-term protection against HIV-1 are still debated. Here, we investigate the potential of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody to provide long-term protection in a NHP model of HIV-1 infection.

While the atomic-level consequences of cleavage for HIV-1 Env are still being determined, the uncleaved state is antigenically distinct from the mature closed state, and cleavage has been reported to be essential for mimicry of the mature viral spike by soluble versions of Env. Here we report the redesign of a current state-of-the-art soluble Env mimic, BG505.SOSIP, to make it cleavage independent. Specifically, we replaced the furin cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with Gly-Ser linkers of various lengths. The resultant linked gp120-gp41 constructs, termed single-chain gp140 (sc-gp140), exhibited different levels of structural and antigenic mimicry of the parent cleaved BG505.SOSIP. When constructs were subjected to negative selection to remove subspecies recognized by poorly neutralizing antibodies, trimers of high antigenic mimicry of BG505.SOSIP could be obtained; negative-stain electron microscopy indicated these to resemble the mature closed state. Higher proportions of BG505.SOSIP-trimer mimicry were observed in sc-gp140s with linkers of 6 or more residues, with a linker length of 15 residues exhibiting especially promising traits. Overall, flexible linkages between gp120 and gp41 in BG505.SOSIP can thus substitute for cleavage, and sc-gp140s that closely mimicked the vaccine-preferred mature closed state of Env could be obtained.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can stably express HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). However, even the best bNAbs neutralize 10-50% of HIV-1 isolates inefficiently (80% inhibitory concentration (IC80)\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml(-1)), suggesting that high concentrations of these antibodies would be necessary to achieve general protection. Here we show that eCD4-Ig, a fusion of CD4-Ig with a small CCR5-mimetic sulfopeptide, binds avidly and cooperatively to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and is more potent than the best bNAbs (geometric mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50)\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml(-1)). Because eCD4-Ig binds only conserved regions of Env, it is also much broader than any bNAb. For example, eCD4-Ig efficiently neutralized 100% of a diverse panel of neutralization-resistant HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, including a comprehensive set of isolates resistant to the CD4-binding site bNAbs VRC01, NIH45-46 and 3BNC117. Rhesus macaques inoculated with an AAV vector stably expressed 17-77\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml(-1) of fully functional rhesus eCD4-Ig for more than 40\u00a0weeks, and these macaques were protected from several infectious challenges with SHIV-AD8. Rhesus eCD4-Ig was also markedly less immunogenic than rhesus forms of four well-characterized bNAbs.

the partial efficacy of a vaccine regimen with an estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 31% for protecting low-risk Thai volunteers against acquisition of HIV-1. The impact of vaccine-induced immune responses can be investigated through sieve analysis of HIV-1 breakthrough infections (infected vaccine and placebo recipients). A V1/V2-targeted comparison of the genomes of HIV-1 breakthrough viruses identified two V2 amino acid sites that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Here we extended the V1/V2 analysis to the entire HIV-1 genome using an array of methods based on individual sites, k-mers and genes/proteins. We identified 56 amino acid sites or \"signatures\" and 119 k-mers that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Of those, 19 sites and 38 k-mers were located in the regions comprising the RV144 vaccine (Env-gp120, Gag, and Pro). The nine signature sites in Env-gp120 were significantly enriched for known antibody-associated sites (p = 0.0021). In particular, site 317 in the third variable loop (V3) overlapped with a hotspot of antibody recognition, and sites 369 and 424 were linked to CD4 binding site neutralization. The identified signature sites significantly covaried with other sites across the genome (mean = 32.1) more than did non-signature sites (mean = 0.9) (p < 0.0001), suggesting functional and/or structural relevance of the signature sites. Since signature sites were not preferentially restricted to the vaccine immunogens and because most of the associations were insignificant following correction for multiple testing, we predict that few of the genetic differences are strongly linked to the RV144 vaccine-induced immune pressure.

These types of data are discrete, high-dimensional, and complex. We propose to study the impact of protein sequences on binary outcomes using a kernel-based logistic regression model, which models the effect of protein through a random effect whose variance-covariance matrix is mostly determined by a kernel function. We propose a novel, biologically motivated, profile hidden Markov model (HMM)-based mutual information (MI) kernel. Hypothesis testing can be carried out using the maximum of the score statistics and a parametric bootstrap procedure. To improve the power of testing, we propose intuitive modifications to the test statistic. We show through simulation studies that the profile HMM-based MI kernel can be substantially more powerful than competing kernels, and that the modified test statistics bring incremental gains in power.

Env possesses conserved antigenic determinants, such as the gp120 primary receptor CD4 binding site (CD4bs), a known neutralization target. Env also contains variable regions and protein surfaces occluded within the trimer that elicit nonneutralizing antibodies. Here we engineered additional N-linked glycans onto a cysteine-stabilized gp120 core (0G) deleted of its major variable regions to preferentially expose the conformationally fixed CD4bs. Three, 6, 7, and 10 new NXT/S glycan (G) motifs were engineered into 0G to encode 3G, 6G, 7G, and 10G cores. Following purification, most glycoproteins, except for 10G, were recognized by broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies. Gel and glycan mass spectrometry confirmed that additional N-glycans were posttranslationally added to the redesigned cores. Binding kinetics revealed high-affinity recognition by seven broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies and low to no binding by non-broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies. Rabbits inoculated with the hyperglycosylated cores elicited IgM and IgG responses to each given protein that were similar in their neutralization characteristics to those elicited by parental 0G. Site-specific glycan masking effects were detected in the elicited sera, and the antisera competed with b12 for CD4bs-directed binding specificity. However, the core-elicited sera showed limited neutralization activity. Trimer priming or boosting of the core immunogens elicited tier 1-level neutralization that mapped to both the CD4bs and V3 and appeared to be trimer dependent. Fine mapping at the CD4bs indicated that conformational stabilization of the cores and addition of N-glycans altered the molecular surface of Env sites of vulnerability to neutralizing antibody, suggesting an explanation for why the elicited neutralization was not improved by this rational design strategy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Binding Sites", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Glycoproteins", "Glycosylation", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV-1", "Immunization", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin M", "Mass Spectrometry", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Engineering", "Rabbits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jidnyasa", "Last Name": "Ingale", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Tran", "Affiliation": "IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center at TSRI, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leopold", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barna", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Viral Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Schief", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center at TSRI, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard T", "Last Name": "Wyatt", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center at TSRI, La Jolla, California, USA wyatt@scripps.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "25211073", "Title": "Immunoglobulin gene insertions and deletions in the affinity maturation of HIV-1 broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "Induction of HIV-1 broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development but has remained challenging partially due to unusual traits of bnAbs, including high somatic hypermutation (SHM) frequencies and in-frame insertions and deletions (indels).

The median IC50 of neutralized viruses was 0.033\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml(-1), among the most potent thus far described. 35O22 did not bind monomeric forms of Env tested, but did bind the trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664. Mutagenesis and a reconstruction by negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab in complex with trimer revealed that it bound to a conserved epitope, which stretched across gp120 and gp41. The specificity of 35O22 represents a novel site of vulnerability on HIV Env, which serum analysis indicates to be commonly elicited by natural infection.

epitopes in the C1 region of gp120 (A32-like epitopes) as targets of potentially protective antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses. A32-like epitopes are highly immunogenic, as infected or vaccinated individuals frequently produce antibodies specific for these determinants. Antibody titers, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against these epitopes, however, do not consistently correlate with protection. Here, we report crystal structures of CD4-stabilized gp120 cores complexed with the Fab fragments of two nonneutralizing, A32-like monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), N5-i5 and 2.2c, that compete for antigen binding and have similar antigen-binding affinities yet exhibit a 75-fold difference in ADCC potency. We find that these MAbs recognize overlapping epitopes formed by mobile layers 1 and 2 of the gp120 inner domain, including the C1 and C2 regions, but bind gp120 at different angles via juxtaposed VH and VL contact surfaces. A comparison of structural and immunological data further showed that antibody orientation on bound antigen and the capacity to form multivalent antigen-antibody complexes on target cells were key determinants of ADCC potency, with the latter process having the greater impact. These studies provide atomic-level definition of A32-like epitopes implicated as targets of protective antibodies in RV144. Moreover, these studies establish that epitope structure and mode of antibody binding can dramatically affect the potency of Fc-mediated effector function against HIV-1. These results provide key insights for understanding, refining, and improving the outcome of HIV vaccine trials, in which relevant immune responses are facilitated by A32-like elicited responses.",

the past 5 years, a new generation of highly potent and broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies has been identified. These antibodies can protect against lentiviral infection in nonhuman primates (NHPs), suggesting that passive antibody transfer would prevent HIV-1 transmission in humans. To increase the protective efficacy of such monoclonal antibodies, we employed next-generation sequencing, computational bioinformatics, and structure-guided design to enhance the neutralization potency and breadth of VRC01, an antibody that targets the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 envelope. One variant, VRC07-523, was 5- to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, neutralized 96% of viruses tested, and displayed minimal autoreactivity. To compare its protective efficacy to that of VRC01 in vivo, we performed a series of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge experiments in nonhuman primates and calculated the doses of VRC07-523 and VRC01 that provide 50% protection (EC50). VRC07-523 prevented infection in NHPs at a 5-fold lower concentration than VRC01. These results suggest that increased neutralization potency in vitro correlates with improved protection against infection in vivo, documenting the improved functional efficacy of VRC07-523 and its potential clinical relevance for protecting against HIV-1 infection in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV-1", "Immunization,

However, one of the compounds, NBD-09027, exhibited reduced agonist properties, in both functional and biophysical studies. To understand the binding mode of these inhibitors, we first generated HIV-1-resistant mutants, assessed their behavior with NBD compounds, and determined the X-ray structures of two inhibitors, NBD-09027 and NBD-10007, in complex with the HIV-1 gp120 core at \u223c2-\u00c5 resolution. Both studies confirmed that the NBD compounds bind similarly to NBD-556 and NBD-557 by inserting their hydrophobic groups into the Phe43 cavity of gp120. The basic nitrogen of the piperidine ring is located in close proximity to D368 of gp120 but it does not form any H-bond or salt bridge, a likely explanation for their nonoptimal antagonist properties. The results reveal the structural and biological character of the NBD series of CD4 mimetics and identify ways to reduce their agonist properties and convert them to antagonists.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Antigens", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Oxalates", "Piperidines", "Protein Binding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Curreli", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Modeling and Drug Design, Lindsey F.

If the target region is a supersite of HIV-1 vulnerability, recognized by a collection of broadly neutralizing antibodies, this strategy affords the creation of \"supersite transplants\", capable of binding (and potentially eliciting) antibodies similar to the template collection of effective antibodies. Here we transplant three supersites of HIV-1 vulnerability, each targeted by effective neutralizing antibodies from multiple donors. To implement our strategy, we chose a single representative antibody against each of the target supersites: antibody 10E8, which recognizes the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) on the HIV-1 gp41 glycoprotein; antibody PG9, which recognizes variable regions one and two (V1V2) on the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein; and antibody PGT128 which recognizes a glycopeptide supersite in variable region 3 (glycan V3) on gp120. We used a structural alignment algorithm to identify suitable acceptor proteins, and then designed, expressed, and tested antigenically over 100-supersite transplants in a 96-well microtiter-plate format. The majority of the supersite transplants failed to maintain the antigenic properties of their respective template supersite. However, seven of the glycan V3-supersite transplants exhibited nanomolar affinity to effective neutralizing antibodies from at least three donors and recapitulated the mannose9-N-linked glycan requirement of the template supersite. The binding of these transplants could be further enhanced by placement into self-assembling nanoparticles. Essential elements of the glycan V3 supersite, embodied by as few as 3 N-linked glycans and \u223c 25 Env residues, can be segregated into acceptor scaffolds away from the immune-evading capabilities of the rest of HIV-1 Env, thereby providing a means to focus the immune response on the scaffolded supersite.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Envelope Protein gp41", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Models, Molecular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gilad", "Last Name": "Ofek", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sanjay", "Last Name": "Srivatsan", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksandr", "Last Name": "Druz", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christopher R", "Last Name": "Lees", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cinque", "Last Name": "Soto", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Stuckey", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dennis R", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science and IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center, and Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Design, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wayne C", "Last Name": "Koff", "Affiliation": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "HIV-Specific Immunity Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24990883", "Title": "Neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 envelope protect more effectively in vivo than those to the CD4 receptor.", "Abstract": "HIV-1 infection depends on effective viral entry mediated by the interaction of its envelope (Env) glycoprotein with specific cell surface receptors.

Improved neutralization breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive diversification of the virus population.

small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 entry: conversion of a viral entry agonist to an antagonist.", "Abstract": "This Account provides an overview of a multidisciplinary consortium focused on structure-based strategies to devise small molecule antagonists of HIV-1 entry into human T-cells, which if successful would hold considerable promise for the development of prophylactic modalities to prevent HIV transmission and thereby alter the course of the AIDS pandemic. Entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target T-cells entails an interaction between CD4 on the host T-cell and gp120, a component of the trimeric envelope glycoprotein spike on the virion surface. The resultant interaction initiates a series of conformational changes within the envelope spike that permits binding to a chemokine receptor, formation of the gp41 fusion complex, and cell entry. A hydrophobic cavity at the CD4-gp120 interface, defined by X-ray crystallography, provided an initial site for small molecule antagonist design. This site however has evolved to facilitate viral entry. As such, the binding of prospective small molecule inhibitors within this gp120 cavity can inadvertently trigger an allosteric entry signal. Structural characterization of the CD4-gp120 interface, which provided the foundation for small molecule structure-based inhibitor design, will be presented first. An integrated approach combining biochemical, virological, structural, computational, and synthetic studies, along with a detailed analysis of ligand binding energetics, revealed that modestly active small molecule inhibitors of HIV entry can also promote viral entry into cells lacking the CD4 receptor protein; these competitive inhibitors were termed small molecule CD4 mimetics. Related congeners were subsequently identified with both improved binding affinity and more potent viral entry inhibition. Further assessment of the affinity-enhanced small molecule CD4 mimetics demonstrated that premature initiation of conformational change within the viral envelope spike, prior to cell encounter, can lead to irreversible deactivation of viral entry machinery. Related congeners, which bind the same gp120 site, possess different propensities to elicit the allosteric response that underlies the undesired enhancement of CD4-independent viral entry.

Antibodies of this class have developmental commonalities, but typically share only \u223c50% amino acid sequence identity among different donors. Here we apply next-generation sequencing to identify VRC01 class antibodies in a new donor, C38, directly from B cell transcript sequences. We first tested a lineage rank approach, but this was unsuccessful, likely because VRC01 class antibody sequences were not highly prevalent in this donor. We next identified VRC01 class heavy chains through a phylogenetic analysis that included thousands of sequences from C38 and a few known VRC01 class sequences from other donors. This \"cross-donor analysis\" yielded heavy chains with little sequence homology to previously identified VRC01 class heavy chains. Nonetheless, when reconstituted with the light chain from VRC01, half of the heavy chain chimeric antibodies showed substantial neutralization potency and breadth. We then identified VRC01 class light chains through a five-amino-acid sequence motif necessary for VRC01 light chain recognition. From over a million light chain sequences, we identified 13 candidate VRC01 class members.

We describe full-length IgG2b and IgG3 versions of JM4 that target the coreceptor-binding site and potently neutralize over 95% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Contrary to established trends that show improved access to the coreceptor-binding region by smaller antibody fragments, the single-domain (VHH) version of JM4 neutralized less well than the full-length IgG2b version of JM4. The crystal structure at 2.1-\u00c5 resolution of VHH JM4 bound to HIV-1 YU2 gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state by the CD4-mimetic miniprotein, M48U1, revealed a JM4 epitope that combined regions of coreceptor recognition (including the gp120 bridging sheet, V3 loop, and \u03b219 strand) with gp120 structural elements involved in recognition of CD4 such as the CD4-binding loop. The structure of JM4 with gp120 thus defines a novel CD4-induced site of vulnerability involving elements of both coreceptor- and CD4-binding sites. The potently neutralizing JM4 IgG2b antibody that targets this newly defined site of vulnerability adds to the expanding repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies that effectively neutralize HIV-1 and thereby potentially provides a new template for vaccine development and target for HIV-1 therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Binding Sites", "Camelids, New World", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV-1", "Immunoglobulin G", "Neutralization Tests", "Surface Plasmon Resonance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Priyamvada", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. acharyap@mail.nih.gov"}, {"First Name": "Timothy S", "Last Name": "Luongo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivelin S", "Last Name": "Georgiev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Matz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen D", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pascal", "Last Name": "Kessler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Baty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Chames", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lo\u00efc", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23831758", "Title": "Synthetic glycopeptides reveal the glycan specificity of HIV-neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "A new class of glycan-reactive HIV-neutralizing antibodies, including PG9 and PG16, has been recently discovered that seem to recognize previously uncharacterized glycopeptide epitopes on HIV-1 gp120.

We identified variants with up to 28% difference in amino acid sequence. Heavy- and light-chain phylogenetic trees of identified 10E8 variants displayed similar architectures, and 10E8 variants reconstituted from matched and unmatched phylogenetic branches displayed significantly lower autoreactivity when matched. To test the generality of phylogenetic pairing, we analyzed donor International AIDS Vaccine Initiative 84, the source of antibodies PGT141-145. Heavy- and light-chain phylogenetic trees of PGT141-145 somatic variants also displayed remarkably similar architectures; in this case, branch pairings could be anchored by known PGT141-145 antibodies.

Only a limited number of regions on the HIV-1 spike, however, are recognized by these antibodies. One of these regions (N332) is characterized by an N-linked glycan at residue 332 on HIV-1 gp120 and is recognized by antibody 2G12 and by the recently reported antibodies PGT121-137, the latter isolated from three donors. To investigate the diversity in mode of antibody recognition at the N332 site, we used functional complementation between antibody heavy and light chains as a means of assessing similarity in mode of recognition. We examined a matrix of 12 PGT-heavy chains with each of 12 PGT-light chains. Expression in 96-well format for the 144 antibodies (132 chimeric and 12 wild-type) was generally consistent (58 \u00b1 10 \u00b5g/ml). In contrast, recognition of HIV-1 gp120 was bimodal: when the source of heavy and light chains was from the same donor, recognition was good; when sources of heavy and light chains were from different donors, recognition was poor. Moreover, neutralization of HIV-1 strains SF162.LS and TRO.11 generally followed patterns of gp120 recognition. These results are consistent with published sequence, mutational, and structural findings, all of which indicate that N332-directed neutralizing antibodies from different donors utilize different modes of recognition, and provide support for a correlation between functional complementation of antibody heavy and light chains and similarity in antibody mode of recognition. Overall, our results add to the growing body of evidence that the human immune system is capable of recognizing the N332-region of HIV-1 gp120 in diverse ways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibody Affinity", "Asparagine", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Neutralization Tests", "Phylogeny", "Protein Binding", "Structural Homology, Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Pancera", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason S", "Last Name": "McLellan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Stuckey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dennis R", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wayne C", "Last Name": "Koff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23313589", "Title": "Vaccine induction of antibodies against a structurally heterogeneous site of immune pressure within HIV-1 envelope protein variable regions 1 and 2.", "Abstract": "The RV144 HIV-1 trial of the canary pox vector (ALVAC-HIV) plus the gp120 AIDSVAX B/E vaccine demonstrated an estimated efficacy of 31%, which correlated directly with antibodies to HIV-1 envelope variable regions 1 and 2 (V1-V2). Genetic analysis of trial viruses revealed increased vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine strain at V2 residue 169.

Crystal structures of two of the V2 antibodies demonstrated that residue 169 can exist within divergent helical and loop conformations, which contrasted dramatically with the \u03b2 strand conformation previously observed with a broadly neutralizing antibody PG9.

While the outer domain is conformationally more stable than other portions of the HIV-1 envelope, efforts to express the outer domain as an immunogen for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies have not been successful, potentially because natural outer domain variants do not bind strongly to antibodies such as VRC01. In this study, we optimized the antigenic properties of the HIV-1 Env outer domain to generate OD4.2.2, from the KER2018 strain of clade A HIV-1, enabling it to bind antibodies such as VRC01 with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of OD4.2.2 in complex with VRC-PG04 was solved at 3.0-\u00c5 resolution and compared to known crystal structures including (i) the structure of core gp120 bound by VRC-PG04 and (ii) a circularly permutated version of the outer domain in complex with antibody PGT128. Much of the VRC-PG04 epitope was preserved in the OD4.2.2 structure, though with altered N and C termini conformations. Overall, roughly one-third of the outer domain structure appeared to be fixed in conformation, independent of alterations in termini, clade, or ligand, while other portions of the outer domain displayed substantial structural malleability.
