Adverse exposures pre-conception, antenatally and in early childhood have lifetime impacts on respiratory health. For the most part, lung function tracks from the pre-school years at least into late middle age, and airflow obstruction is associated not merely with poor respiratory outcomes but also early all-cause morbidity and mortality. Much would be preventable if social determinants of adverse outcomes were to be addressed. This review presents the perspectives of paediatricians from many different contexts, both high and low income, including Europe, the Americas, Australasia, India, Africa and China. It should be noted that there are islands of poverty within even the highest income settings and, conversely, opulent areas in even the most deprived countries. The heaviest burden of any adverse effects falls on those of the lowest socioeconomic status. Themes include passive exposure to tobacco smoke and indoor and outdoor pollution, across the entire developmental course, and lack of access even to simple affordable medications, let alone the new biologicals. Commonly, disease outcomes are worse in resource-poor areas. Both within and between countries there are avoidable gross disparities in outcomes. Climate change is also bearing down hardest on the poorest children. This review highlights the need for vigorous advocacy for children to improve lifelong health. It also highlights that there are ongoing culturally sensitive interventions to address social determinants of disease which are already benefiting children.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "China", "Europe", "Morbidity", "Poverty", "Social Determinants of Health", "Female", "Pregnancy", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Respiration Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Bush", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK a.bush@imperial.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Byrnes", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics: Child and Youth Health, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Starship Children's Health and Kidz First Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Kate C", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."}, {"First Name": "Anne B", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and Social Work, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane and Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Juliana C", "Last Name": "Ferreira", "Affiliation": "Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Karl A", "Last Name": "Holden", "Affiliation": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Lovinsky-Desir", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Redding", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Varinder", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India."}, {"First Name": "Ian P", "Last Name": "Sinha", "Affiliation": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK."}, {"First Name": "Heather J", "Last Name": "Zar", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and SA-MRC Unit on Child and Adolescent Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "Journal": "European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society", "PubDate": "2024Apr30"}, {"PMID": "38104949", "Title": "Trajectory analysis of rhinitis in a birth cohort from lower-income New York City neighborhoods.", "Abstract": "Rhinitis is a prevalent, chronic nasal condition associated with asthma.

To address these gaps, the members of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Advisory Group (DEI-AG) of the American Thoracic Society Pediatrics Assembly created and distributed a Needs Assessment Survey in the United States and Canada to better understand the racial and ethnic demographics of the pediatric pulmonary workforce and to learn more about successes, gaps, and opportunities to enhance how we recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce.

This Official ATS Workshop Report aims to identify barriers and opportunities for recruitment, training, and career development within the field of pediatric pulmonology. Additionally, we offer useful strategies and resources to improve the recruitment of URiM residents, the mentorship of trainees and junior faculty, and the career development of URiM faculty in academic centers.

Vulnerability varied spatially across NYC, and hierarchical cluster analysis using subdomain scores revealed six patterns of vulnerability across domains: 1) low in all, 2) primarily low except residential, 3) medium in all, 4) high demographic, economic, and residential 5) high economic, residential, and health status, and 6) high demographic, economic and health status.

There is rising concern that the use of race and ethnicity in PFT interpretation contributes to a false view of fixed differences between races and may mask the effects of differential exposures. This use of race and ethnicity may contribute to health disparities by norming differences in pulmonary function. In the United States and globally, race serves as a social construct that is based on appearance and reflects social values, structures, and practices. Classification of people into racial and ethnic groups differs geographically and temporally. These considerations challenge the notion that racial and ethnic categories have biological meaning and question the use of race in PFT interpretation. The ATS convened a diverse group of clinicians and investigators for a workshop in 2021 to evaluate the use of race and ethnicity in PFT interpretation.

Furthermore, studies to assess and characterize various features of peak exposure are very limited especially among children. A better understanding of characteristics of BC peak exposure would improve our understanding of health risks associated with BC. By capturing personal BC exposure at 5-min intervals using a real-time monitor during 24-hr monitoring periods among children in New York City (NYC), we defined 'peak characteristics' in 4 different ways across three major microenvironments (school vs. commute vs. home): 1) mean concentrations of BC across the 3 microenvironments, 2) 'peak duration' or time spent above the peak threshold (i.e., \u22651.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3), 3) 'peak intensity' or the rate of exposure, defined as time spent above the threshold within each microenvironment divided by the total time spent in the microenvironment and 4) a novel metric of 'peak variability', defined as frequency of peaks (i.e., data points with +50% and -50% changes compared to the preceding and the subsequent data points), divided by the total time spent in the microenvironment. While peak duration was greatest at home, the intensity of peak exposure was greatest during commute hours, despite the short time spent in commute (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Peak variability was highest during commute, yet lowest in home environments (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), particularly during non-sleeping hours. Children residing in a high-density urban setting spent on average, 5.4\u00a0hr per day above our peak threshold (\u22651.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) in their everyday environments.

The marked variability in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality from asthma across and within nations in the Americas offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the risk factors and management of asthma phenotypes and endotypes in children and adults. Moreover, a better assessment of the causes and treatment of asthma in less economically developed regions in the Americas would help diagnose and treat individuals migrating from those areas to Canada and the United States. In this focused review, we first assess the epidemiology of asthma, review known and potential risk factors, and examine commonalities and differences in asthma management across the Americas. We then discuss future directions in research and health policies to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of pediatric and adult asthma in the Americas, including standardized and periodic assessment of asthma burden across the region; large-scale longitudinal studies including omics and comprehensive environmental data on racially and ethnically diverse populations; and dissemination and implementation of guidelines for asthma management across the spectrum of disease severity. New initiatives should recognize differences in socioeconomic development and health care systems across the region while paying particular attention to novel or more impactful risk factors for asthma in the Americas, including indoor pollutants such as biomass fuel, tobacco use, infectious agents and the microbiome, and psychosocial stressor and chronic stress.", "Keywords": ["Americas", "asthma", "risk factors", "treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Americas", "Asthma", "Brazil", "Canada", "Child", "Humans", "Latin America", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erick", "Last Name": "Forno", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Pediatric Asthma Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Diego D", "Last Name": "Brandenburg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Pulmonology Unit, Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jose A", "Last Name": "Castro-Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Carlos A", "Last Name": "Celis-Preciado", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universitario San Ignacio and Faculty of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Fernando", "Last Name": "Holguin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Licskai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Western University Canada, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Lovinsky-Desir", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marcia", "Last Name": "Pizzichini", "Affiliation": "Post-Graduate Program of Medical Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Teper", "Affiliation": "Respiratory Center, Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Dr. Ricardo Guti\u00e9rrez, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina; and."}, {"First Name": "Connie", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Juan C", "Last Name": "Celed\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Pediatric Asthma Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "Annals of the American Thoracic Society", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "34845655", "Title": "Multi-Level Socioenvironmental Contributors to Childhood Asthma in New York City: a Cluster Analysis.", "Abstract": "Childhood asthma exacerbation remains the leading cause of pediatric emergency department visits and hospitalizations and disproportionately affects Latinx and Black children, compared to non-Latinx White children in NYC. Environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors may jointly contribute to childhood asthma exacerbations; however, they are often studied separately. To better investigate the multiple contributors to disparities in childhood asthma, we compiled data on various individual and neighborhood level socioeconomic and environmental factors, including education, race/ethnicity, income disparities, gentrification, housing characteristics, built environment, and structural racism, from the NYC Department of Health's KIDS 2017 survey and the US Census' American Community Survey. We applied cluster analysis and logistic regression to first identify the predominant patterns of social and environmental factors experienced by children in NYC and then estimate whether children experiencing specific patterns are more likely to experience asthma exacerbations. We found that housing and built environment characteristics, such as density and age of buildings, were the predominant features to differentiate the socio-environmental patterns observed in New York City. Children living in neighborhoods with greater proportions of rental housing, high-density buildings, and older buildings were more likely to experience asthma exacerbations than other children.

However, most current studies fail to include substantial cohorts of racial/ethnic minority populations. Such underrepresentation may lead to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of disease, wide application of approved interventions without appropriate knowledge of their usefulness in certain populations, and development of recommendations that are not broadly applicable.Goals: To develop best practices for recruitment and retention of racial/ethnic minorities for clinical research in pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine.Methods: The American Thoracic Society convened a workshop in May of 2019. This included an international interprofessional group from academia, industry, the NIH, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with expertise ranging from clinical and biomedical research to community-based participatory research methods and patient advocacy. Workshop participants addressed historical and current mistrust of scientific research, systemic bias, and social and structural barriers to minority participation in clinical research. A literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to support conclusions. The search was not a systematic review of the literature.Results: Barriers at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and federal/policy levels were identified as limiting to minority participation in clinical research. Through the use of a multilevel framework, workshop participants proposed evidence-based solutions to the identified barriers.Conclusions: To date, minority participation in clinical research is not representative of the U.S. and global populations.

We developed a novel Bayesian method for high-dimensional longitudinal data and showed that race-associated DNAm patterns at birth and age 7 are nearly identical. Additionally, we estimated that up to 51% of all self-reported race-associated CpGs had race-dependent DNAm levels that were mediated through local genotype and, quite surprisingly, found that genetic factors explained an overwhelming majority of the variation in DNAm levels at other, previously identified, environmentally-associated CpGs.

"Title": "Locations of Adolescent Physical Activity in an Urban Environment and Their Associations with Air Pollution and Lung Function.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Physical activity while being exposed to high concentrations of air pollution may lead to greater inhalation of pollutant particles and gases. Thus, owing to features of the built city environment, specific locations where physical activity take place may put individuals at increased risk for harmful inhaled exposures leading to decrements in lung function.Objectives: The objectives were to determine locations throughout an urban landscape where children engage in moderate to vigorous activity (MVA). We hypothesized that outdoor activity would be associated with increased exposure to air pollution and reduced lung function.Methods: Children aged 9-14 years living in New York City (NYC) (n\u2009=\u2009151) wore global positioning system devices and wrist accelerometers for two 24-hour periods. Time-stamped global positioning system points and accelerometer data were aggregated and mapped using ArcGIS to determine locations where children engaged in MVA. Location-specific particulate matter <2.5 microns and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was determined based on land use regression models of street-level pollution. Temporal air pollution exposure was determined based on daily concentrations collected at one central site in NYC. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF25-75) were collected following each 24-hour period. Data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models to examine associations between MVA time and both lung function and air pollution in separate models. Additionally, a multiplicative interaction term (MVA time\u2009\u00d7\u2009season) was included to test whether the association between MVA time and lung function outcomes varied by warmer versus colder months.Results: On average, children spent less MVA time outdoors (38.2\u2009\u00b1\u200939.6 min/d) compared with indoors (71.9\u2009\u00b1\u200974.7 min/d, P\u2009<\u20090.01), regardless of season. The majority of outdoor MVA occurred along sidewalks and roadbeds (30.2\u2009\u00b1\u200933.3 min/d, 76.9% of outdoor) where annual average concentrations of NO2 were relatively high. Interquartile range (IQR) increase in outdoor MVA time (44 min) was associated with higher levels of annual average NO2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01) but not particulate matter <2.5 microns. In warmer months, for IQR increase in outdoor MVA time, children had 1.41% lower FEV1/FVC (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -2.46 to -0.36) and 4.40% lower percent predicted FEF25-75 (95% CI, -8.02 to -0.78). These results persisted even after adjustment for location-specific annual average concentrations of NO2. No association was observed between MVA time and lung function in colder months (P\u2009>\u20090.05), and a formal test for interaction (MVA time\u2009\u00d7\u2009season) was significant (P value for interaction\u2009=\u20090.01 and 0.03 for FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75, respectively).Conclusions: Children in NYC spent less time active outdoors compared with indoors. Outdoor activity was greatest near traffic sources and associated with higher annual average concentrations of NO2. In warmer months, outdoor activity was associated with lower lung function, but this association did not appear to be mediated by higher exposure to outdoor pollution during exercise.", "Keywords": ["asthma", "built environment", "exercise", "nitrogen dioxide"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Air Pollutants", "Air Pollution", "Child", "Environmental Exposure", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "New York City", "Parks, Recreational", "Particulate Matter", "Residence Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Lovinsky-Desir", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Kyung Hwa", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Montilla", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Jessie", "Last Name": "Cahill", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Sheehan", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Frederica", "Last Name": "Perera", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Steven N", "Last Name": "Chillrud", "Affiliation": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Goldsmith", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Perzanowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Rundle", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health."}], "Journal": "Annals of the American Thoracic Society", "PubDate": "2021Jan"}, {"PMID": "32771560", "Title": "Asthma among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and related outcomes.", "Abstract": "Several underlying conditions have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 illness, but it remains unclear whether underlying asthma is associated with worse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.", "Keywords": ["New York City", "SARS-CoV-2", "coronavirus", "respiratory disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Asthma", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "Pandemics", "Patient Readmission", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Prevalence", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Lovinsky-Desir", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY.

This paradoxical relationship may be linked to altered T regulatory (Treg) cell activity, which increases with exercise and suppresses airway inflammation, but decreases in association with exposure to air pollution.

Here, we focus on the developing paradigm that epigenetic dysregulation in asthma and allergy may start as early as in utero following several environmental exposures. We summarize the pathways important to the allergic immune response that are epigenetically regulated, the key environmental exposures associated with epigenetic changes in asthma genes, and newly identified epigenetic biomarkers that have been linked to clinical asthma. We conclude with a brief discussion about the potential to apply newly developing technologies in epigenetics to the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and allergy. The inherent plasticity of epigenetic regulation following environmental exposures offers opportunities for prevention using environmental remediation, measuring novel biomarkers for early identification of those at risk, and applying advances in pharmaco-epigenetics to tailor medical therapies that maximize efficacy of treatment. 'Precision Medicine' in asthma and allergy is arriving. As the field advances this may involve an individually tailored approach to the prevention, early detection, and treatment of disease based on the knowledge of an individual's epigenetic profile.", "Keywords": ["asthma", "environment", "epigenetic regulation", "precision medicine", "prenatal exposures"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Antigen Presentation", "Asthma", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dendritic Cells", "Environmental Exposure", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Male", "Maternal Exposure", "Particulate Matter", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Volatile Organic Compounds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mari\u00e0ngels", "Last Name": "de Planell-Saguer", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Lovinsky-Desir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Environmental and molecular mutagenesis", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}]
