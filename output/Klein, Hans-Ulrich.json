[{"PMID": "38889126", "Title": "Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these \"mind-mitochondria\" associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes.", "Keywords": ["mitochondria", "proteome", "psychosocial factors", "single cell RNA-seq", "transcriptome"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mitochondria", "Male", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Female", "Brain", "Aged", "Stress, Psychological", "Middle Aged", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Neurons", "Proteomics", "Affect"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Trumpff", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Monzel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Sandi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne CH-1015, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Vladislav A", "Last Name": "Petyuk", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354."}, {"First Name": "Cheyenne", "Last Name": "Hurst", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Duc M", "Last Name": "Duong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas T", "Last Name": "Seyfried", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Aliza P", "Last Name": "Wingo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Thomas S", "Last Name": "Wingo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Yanling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Madhav", "Last Name": "Thambisetty", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Section, Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, Baltimore, MD 21224."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Ferrucci", "Affiliation": "Longitudinal Studies Section, Translational Gerontology Branch, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2024Jul02"}, {"PMID": "38514782", "Title": "Cell subtype-specific effects of genetic variation in the Alzheimer's disease brain.", "Abstract": "The relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain cell types and subtypes remains understudied. Here, we generated single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the neocortex of 424 individuals of advanced age; we assessed the effect of genetic variants on RNA expression in cis (cis-expression quantitative trait loci) for seven cell types and 64 cell subtypes using 1.5 million transcriptomes. This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,099 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer's disease pathology, after adjusting for APOE\u03b54, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies. Furthermore, only a TMEM106B variant affects the proportion of cell subtypes.

These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for preserving cognitive function in the setting of AD pathology.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "ZCCHC17", "iPSC", "neurons", "synaptic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne Marie W", "Last Name": "Bartosch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Elliot H H", "Last Name": "Youth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shania", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232."}, {"First Name": "Maria E", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Harrison", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "So Yeon", "Last Name": "Koo", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Archana", "Last Name": "Ashok", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sharanya", "Last Name": "Sivakumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh K", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Logan C", "Last Name": "Dumitrescu", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany G", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ali S", "Last Name": "Ropri", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Annie J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Young-Pearse", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Hohman", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Mar21"}, {"PMID": "36865313", "Title": "Cell-type-specific regulation of APOE levels in human neurons by the Alzheimer's disease risk gene SORL1.", "Abstract": "SORL1 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through human genetic studies that point to an association of reduced SORL1 levels with higher risk for AD. To interrogate the role(s) of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1 null iPSCs were generated, followed by differentiation to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 led to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. Intriguingly, SORL1 loss led to a dramatic neuron-specific reduction in APOE levels. Further, analyses of iPSCs derived from a human aging cohort revealed a neuron-specific linear correlation between SORL1 and APOE RNA and protein levels, a finding validated in human post-mortem brain. Pathway analysis implicated intracellular transport pathways and TGF- \u03b2/SMAD signaling in the function of SORL1 in neurons.

Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging 5. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan.

Here, we performed an unsupervised clustering of individuals with multi-region brain transcriptomes to assess whether a broader approach, simultaneously considering data from multiple regions involved in cognition would uncover such subsets. We implemented a canonical correlation-based analysis in a Discovery cohort of 459 participants from two longitudinal studies of cognitive aging that have RNA sequence profiles in three brain regions. 690 additional participants that have data in only one or two of these regions were used in the Replication effort. These clustering analyses identified two meta-clusters, MC-1 and MC-2. The two sets of participants differ primarily in their trajectories of cognitive decline, with MC-2 having a delay of 3 years to the median age of incident dementia. This is due, in part, to a greater impact of tau pathology on neuronal chromatin architecture and to broader brain changes including greater loss of white matter integrity in MC-1. Further evidence of biological differences includes a significantly larger impact of APOE\u03b54 risk on cognitive decline in MC-1. These findings suggest that our proposed population structure captures an aspect of the more distributed molecular state of the aging brain that either enhances the effect of risk factors in MC-1 or of protective effects in MC-2.

Yet, limited research has considered epigenetic clocks calculated in brain tissue. We used DNA methylation states in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens from 721 older participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, to calculate DNA methylation age using four established epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and a new Cortical clock. The four established clocks were trained in blood samples (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge) or using 51 human tissue and cell types (Horvath); the recent Cortical clock is the first trained in postmortem cortical tissue. Participants were recruited beginning in 1994 (Religious Orders Study) and 1997 (Memory and Aging Project), and followed annually with questionnaires and clinical evaluations; brain specimens were obtained for 80-90% of participants. Mean age at death was 88.0 (SD 6.7) years. We used linear regression, logistic regression, and linear mixed models, to examine relations of epigenetic clock ages to neuropathologic and clinical aging phenotypes, controlling for chronologic age, sex, education, and depressive symptomatology. Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and Cortical clock ages were related to pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to A\u03b2 load (a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease). However, associations were substantially stronger for the Cortical than other clocks; for example, each standard deviation (SD) increase in Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge clock age was related to approximately 30% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while each SD increase in Cortical age was related to 90% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95% confidence interval 1.38, 2.62). Moreover, Cortical age was significantly related to other AD pathology (eg, mean tau tangle density, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and to odds of neocortical Lewy body pathology (for each SD increase in Cortical age, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 95% confidence 1.27, 3.17), although no clocks were related to cerebrovascular neuropathology.

in 2,114 postmortem samples. We discover 30 brain coexpression modules from seven regions as the major source of AD transcriptional perturbations. We next examine overlap with 251 brain differentially expressed gene sets from mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Human-mouse overlaps highlight responses to amyloid versus tau pathology and reveal age- and sex-dependent expression signatures for disease progression.

In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these profiles have been applied to the target organ: the aging brain. In a growing number of cases, the same samples were profiled with multiple different approaches, yielding genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. Here, we review lessons learned so far as we move beyond quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses which map the effect of genetic variation on molecular features to integrate multiple levels of \"omic\" data in an effort to identify the molecular drivers of AD. One thing is clear: no single layer of molecular or \"omic\" data is sufficient to capture the variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence using different approaches. Thus, we are on the cusp of an acceleration of truly integrative studies as the availability of large numbers of well-characterized brain samples profiled in three or more dimensions enables the testing, comparison and refinement of analytic methods with which to dissect the molecular architecture of the aging brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer", "epigenome", "integrative analysis", "multi-omic", "proteome", "transcriptome"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Computational Biology", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Proteomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32526197", "Title": "Genetics of Gene Expression in the Aging Human Brain Reveal TDP-43 Proteinopathy Pathophysiology.", "Abstract": "Here, we perform a genome-wide screen for variants that regulate the expression of gene co-expression modules in the aging human brain; we discover and replicate such variants in the TMEM106B and RBFOX1 loci.

An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: myeloid cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation and synaptic signaling. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1 transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Bayes Theorem", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Differentiation", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Sch\u00e4fer", "Affiliation": "Mathematical Institute, Heinrich Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Holger", "Last Name": "Schwender", "Affiliation": "Mathematical Institute, Heinrich Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "30559478", "Title": "Epigenome-wide study uncovers large-scale changes in histone acetylation driven by tau pathology in aging and Alzheimer's human brains.", "Abstract": "Accumulation of tau and amyloid-\u03b2 are two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-\u03b2, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect.

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified C/D box snoRNAs and rRNA 2'-O-methylation as critical determinants of leukaemic stem cell activity. Leukaemogenesis by AML1-ETO required expression of the groucho-related amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES). AES functioned by inducing snoRNA/RNP formation via interaction with the RNA helicase DDX21. Similarly, global loss of C/D box snoRNAs with concomitant loss of rRNA 2'-O-methylation resulted in decreased leukaemia self-renewal potential. Genomic deletion of either C/D box snoRNA SNORD14D or SNORD35A suppressed clonogenic potential of leukaemia cells in\u00a0vitro and delayed leukaemogenesis in\u00a0vivo. We further showed that AML1-ETO9a, MYC and MLL-AF9 all enhanced snoRNA formation. Expression levels of C/D box snoRNAs in AML patients correlated closely with in\u00a0vivo frequency of leukaemic stem cells.

Here, we identified loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation as a novel pathway of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic drugs in AML. Low EZH2 protein levels correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Suppression of EZH2 protein expression induced chemoresistance of AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Low EZH2 levels resulted in derepression of HOX genes, and knockdown of HOXB7 and HOXA9 in the resistant cells was sufficient to improve sensitivity to TKIs and cytotoxic drugs. The endogenous loss of EZH2 expression in resistant cells and primary blasts from a subset of relapsed AML patients resulted from enhanced CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr487. This interaction was stabilized by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and followed by proteasomal degradation of EZH2 in drug-resistant cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of HSP90, CDK1 and the proteasome prevented EZH2 degradation, decreased HOX gene expression and restored drug sensitivity. Finally, patients with reduced EZH2 levels at progression to standard therapy responded to the combination of bortezomib and cytarabine, concomitant with the re-establishment of EZH2 expression and blast clearance.

unprecedented look at features of the human genome that affect RNA expression. These \"epigenomic\" features are found in a number of different forms: they include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histone proteins and non-coding RNAs. Some of these features have now been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we focus on recent studies that have identified robust observations relating to DNA methylation and chromatin in human brain tissue; these findings will ground the next generation of studies and provide a model for the design of such studies. Stemming from observations that compounds with histone deacetylase activity may be beneficial in AD, epigenome-wide studies in cortical samples from large numbers of human subjects have now shown that AD-associated epigenomic changes are reproducible, are not driven by genetic risk factors, and are widespread at specific locations in the genome. A fundamental question of whether such changes are causal remains to be demonstrated, but it is already clear that well-powered investigations of the human epigenome in the target organ of a neurodegenerative disease are feasible, are implicating new areas of the genome in the disease, and will be an important tool for future studies. We are now at an inflection point: as genome-wide association studies of genetic variants come to an end, a new generation of studies exploring the epigenome will provide an important new layer of information with which to enrich our understanding of AD pathogenesis and to possibly guide development of new therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Chromatin", "DNA methylation", "Epigenomics", "Histone"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Program in Translational Neuropsychiatric Genomics and Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, NRB 168, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Program in Translational Neuropsychiatric Genomics and Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, NRB 168, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. pdejager@partners.org."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2016Oct"}, {"PMID": "27423266", "Title": "Uncovering the Role of the Methylome in Dementia and Neurodegeneration.", "Abstract": "Our understanding of the epigenome has advanced dramatically over the past decade, particularly in terms of DNA methylation, a modification found throughout the genome.

Due to absence of clinically effective treatment options in inoperable situations and resistance to chemotherapeutics, a critical need exists to identify novel therapeutic targets. We analyzed LPS genomic landscape using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM), recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was noted as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2 (MIR15A, MIR16-1). Significantly and recurrently mutated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) included PLEC (27%), MXRA5 (21%), FAT3 (24%), NF1 (20%), MDC1 (10%), TP53 (7%) and CHEK2 (6%). Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis.

important regulator of immune responses in autoimmune diseases. The recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) is a transcriptional repressor, but converts into a transcriptional activator upon activation of the canonical Notch pathway. Genome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identified a susceptibility locus, rs874040(CC), which implicated the RBPJ gene. Here, chromatin state mapping generated using the chromHMM algorithm reveals strong enhancer regions containing DNase I hypersensitive sites overlapping the rs874040 linkage disequilibrium block in human memory, but not in na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells. The rs874040 overlapping this chromatin state was associated with increased RBPJ expression in stimulated memory CD4(+) T cells from healthy subjects homozygous for the risk allele (CC) compared with memory CD4(+) T cells bearing the protective allele (GG). Transcriptomic analysis of rs874040(CC) memory T cells showed a repression of canonical Notch target genes IL (interleukin)-9, IL-17 and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 in the basal state. Interestingly, activation of the Notch pathway using soluble Notch ligand, Jagged2-Fc, induced IL-9 and IL-17A while delta-like 4Fc, another Notch ligand, induced higher IFN\u03b3 expression in the rs874040(CC) memory CD4(+) T cells compared with their rs874040(GG) counterparts. In RA, RBPJ expression is elevated in memory T cells from RA patients compared with control subjects, and this was associated with induced inflammatory cytokines IL-9, IL-17A and IFN\u03b3 in response to Notch ligation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that the rs874040(CC) allele skews memory T cells toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype involving Notch signaling, thus increasing the susceptibility to develop RA.",

For a deeper understanding, it is crucial to accurately compare DNA methylation patterns between groups of samples representing different conditions. A widely used method to investigate DNA methylation in the CpG context is bisulfite sequencing, which produces data on the single-nucleotide scale. While there are benefits to analyzing CpG sites on a basepair level, there are both biological and statistical reasons to test entire genomic regions for differential methylation. However, the analysis of DNA methylation is hampered by the lack of best practice standards. Here, we compared multiple approaches for testing predefined genomic regions for differential DNA methylation in bisulfite sequencing data. Nine methods were evaluated: BiSeq, COHCAP, Goeman's Global Test, Limma, methylKit/eDMR, RADMeth and three log-linear regression approaches with different distribution assumptions. We applied these methods to simulated data and determined their sensitivity and specificity. This revealed performance differences, which were also seen when applied to real data. Methods that first test single CpG sites and then test regions based on transformed CpG-wise P-values performed better than methods that summarize methylation levels or raw reads. Interestingly, smoothing of methylation levels had a negligible impact.

Moreover, corresponding deletions on 5q35.3 present in 6% of cases led to haploinsufficient DDX41 expression. DDX41 lesions caused altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing.

How tumor aggressiveness is affected by DNA methylation of specific loci is largely unexplored. In genome-wide DNA methylation analyses, we identified the KCa 3.1 channel gene (KCNN4) promoter to be hypomethylated in an aggressive non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line and in patient samples. Accordingly, KCa 3.1 expression was increased in more aggressive NSCLC cells. Both findings were strong predictors for poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Increased KCa 3.1 expression was associated with aggressive features of NSCLC cells. Proliferation and migration of pro-metastatic NSCLC cells depended on KCa 3.1 activity. Mechanistically, elevated KCa 3.1 expression hyperpolarized the membrane potential, thereby augmenting the driving force for Ca(2+) influx. KCa 3.1 blockade strongly reduced the growth of xenografted NSCLC cells in mice as measured by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Thus, loss of DNA methylation of the KCNN4 promoter and increased KCa 3.1 channel expression and function are mechanistically linked to poor survival of NSCLC patients.", "Keywords": ["KCa3.1", "aggressiveness", "lung cancer"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Animals", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Female", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Prognosis", "Promoter Regions, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Etmar", "Last Name": "Bulk", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiology II, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Sophie", "Last Name": "Ay", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cellular Physiology, EA 4667, SFR CAP-SANTE (FED4231), UFR Sciences, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, 80039, France."}, {"First Name": "Mehdi", "Last Name": "Hammadi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cellular Physiology, EA 4667, SFR CAP-SANTE (FED4231), UFR Sciences, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, 80039, France."}, {"First Name": "Halima", "Last Name": "Ouadid-Ahidouch", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cellular Physiology, EA 4667, SFR CAP-SANTE (FED4231), UFR Sciences, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, 80039, France."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Schelhaas", "Affiliation": "European Institute for Molecular Imaging (EIMI), University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Antje", "Last Name": "Hascher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Rohde", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nils H", "Last Name": "Thoennissen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Rainer", "Last Name": "Wiewrodt", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Marra", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Niels-Stensen Clinics, Ostercappeln, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ludger", "Last Name": "Hillejan", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Niels-Stensen Clinics, Ostercappeln, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andreas H", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "European Institute for Molecular Imaging (EIMI), University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Dugas", "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Wolfgang E", "Last Name": "Berdel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "M\u00fcller-Tidow", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Albrecht", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiology II, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Journal": "International journal of cancer", "PubDate": "2015Sep15"}, {"PMID": "25066732", "Title": "A new workflow for whole-genome sequencing of single human cells.", "Abstract": "Unbiased amplification of the whole-genome amplification (WGA) of single cells is crucial to study cancer evolution and genetic heterogeneity, but is challenging due to the high complexity of the human genome.

Amplicons were designed targeting RUNX1, CEBPA, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, EZH2, and TP53 using different PCR amplification strategies and Roche GS FLX Titanium and Illumina MiSeq sequencing platforms. Thirty-three patients with leukemia were selected as an exemplary cohort representing heterogeneous cancer specimens. Both standard two-primer amplification and four-primer microfluidics PCRs yielded highly linear characteristics in detecting molecular alterations in series of dilution experiments. By fitting a linear mixed-effects model to the logarithmized data, a slope \u03b2 of -1.000 (95% CI, \u00b10.046) was obtained for two-primer assays and of -0.998 (95% CI, \u00b10.105) was obtained for four-primer assays, which represented a near-perfect decrease of the mutation load. Furthermore, data are presented on technical precision, limit of detection, and occurrence of small subclones in TP53- and RUNX1-mutated patients to identify clonal disease progression and residual disease. We demonstrate that, depending on the local sequence context for each amplicon, the limit of detection of the assay cannot be lower than a range of 0.25% to 3.5%.

ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage in LSCs caused clinically relevant genomic instability in CML-CP-like mice, such as TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations (E255K, T315I, H396P), deletions in Ikzf1 and Trp53, and additions in Zfp423 and Idh1. Despite inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase, imatinib did not downregulate ROS and oxidative DNA damage in TKI-refractory LSCs to the levels detected in normal cells, and CML-CP-like mice treated with imatinib continued to accumulate clinically relevant genetic aberrations. Inhibition of class I p21-activated protein kinases by IPA3 downregulated ROS in TKI-naive and TKI-treated LSCs.

Cells from APL patients showed increased genome-wide DNA methylation with higher variability than healthy CD34(+) cells, promyelocytes, and remission BM cells. A core set of differentially methylated regions in APL was identified. Age at diagnosis, Sanz score, and Flt3-mutation status characterized methylation subtypes. Transcription factor-binding sites (eg, the c-myc-binding sites) were associated with low methylation. However, SUZ12- and REST-binding sites identified in embryonic stem cells were preferentially DNA hypermethylated in APL cells. Unexpectedly, PML-RAR\u03b1-binding sites were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation in APL cells. Consistent with this, myeloid cells from preleukemic PML-RAR\u03b1 knock-in mice did not show altered DNA methylation and the expression of PML-RAR\u03b1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells prevented differentiation without affecting DNA methylation. Treatment of APL blasts with all-trans retinoic acid also did not result in immediate DNA methylation changes.
