Although effective in many cases, the supervised approach requires extensive labeling and often produces outputs that are unreliable for downstream analyses. Here, we introduce 'Lightning Pose', an efficient pose estimation package with three algorithmic contributions. First, in addition to training on a few labeled video frames, we use many unlabeled videos and penalize the network whenever its predictions violate motion continuity, multiple-view geometry and posture plausibility (semi-supervised learning). Second, we introduce a network architecture that resolves occlusions by predicting pose on any given frame using surrounding unlabeled frames. Third, we refine the pose predictions post hoc by combining ensembling and Kalman smoothing. Together, these components render pose trajectories more accurate and scientifically usable. We released a cloud application that allows users to label data, train networks and process new videos directly from the browser.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Biderman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. db3236@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Whiteway", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. m.whiteway@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Cole", "Last Name": "Hurwitz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Greenspan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Lightning.ai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ankit", "Last Name": "Vishnubhotla", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Federico", "Last Name": "Pedraja", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dillon", "Last Name": "Noone", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Schartner", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Julia M", "Last Name": "Huntenburg", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anup", "Last Name": "Khanal", "Affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guido T", "Last Name": "Meijer", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul", "Last Name": "Noel", "Affiliation": "New York University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Pan-Vazquez", "Affiliation": "Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karolina Z", "Last Name": "Socha", "Affiliation": "University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anne E", "Last Name": "Urai", "Affiliation": "Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "International Brain Laboratory", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel B", "Last Name": "Sawtell", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liam", "Last Name": "Paninski", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature methods", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38812955", "Title": "Randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app designed to reduce unhealthy alcohol consumption.", "Abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol use is common and causes tremendous harm.

Methods: Participants were randomized to be told that the items about cannabis use came from a crime survey versus from a health survey. In addition, the sample was recruited using a representative online sampling method and compared to published rates of self-reported cannabis use collected as part of the Crime Survey for England and Wales. Results: There was no significant difference (p\u2009>\u20090.05) in the proportion endorsing cannabis use between those told the items came from a crime survey versus a health survey. However, self-reported rates of cannabis use collected as part of the online panel (51.3% ever use; 11.9% past year; age range 18-64\u2009years) appeared higher than those reported based on results from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (37.2% ever and 5.8% past year; age range 18-59\u2009years).

Our approach allows for significantly reduced optical sampling and acquisition times whilst also avoiding the need for fitting to complex models of lasers under optical feedback in post-processing. We investigate theoretically the applicability of this method under different levels of optical feedback, different laser parameters, and for different sampling conditions.

Finally we demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional nanoscale imaging of the out-of-plane field supported by individual micro-resonators at THz frequencies.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has been adopted to sustainably manage this polyphagous species with a reduced reliance on chemical pesticides. At present, control measures are aimed at the adult stages of the fly, with no IPM tools available to target larvae once they exit the fruit and pupate in the soil. The use of entomopathogenic fungi may provide a biologically-based control method for these soil-dwelling life stages. The effectiveness of fungal isolates of Metarhizium and Beauveria species were screened under laboratory conditions against Queensland fruit fly. In bioassays, 16 isolates were screened for pathogenicity following exposure of third-instar larvae to inoculum-treated vermiculite used as a pupation substrate. The best performing Metarhizium sp. isolate achieved an average percentage mortality of 93%, whereas the best performing Beauveria isolate was less efficient, with an average mortality of 36%. Susceptibility to infection during different development stages was investigated using selected fungal isolates, with the aim of assessing all soil-dwelling life stages from third-instar larvae to final pupal stages and emerging adults. Overall, the third larval instar was the most susceptible stage, with average mortalities between 51-98% depending on the isolate tested. Moreover, adult mortality was significantly higher when exposed to inoculum during pupal eclosion, with mortalities between 56-76% observed within the first nine days post-emergence. The effect of temperature and inoculum concentration on insect mortality were assessed independently with candidate isolates to determine the optimum temperature range for fungal biological control activity and the rate required for application in field conditions.

Method: A partial sample of a recently completed online depression intervention trial was divided into two groups: those with no risk of suicide versus those with some risk. The two groups were compared for baseline demographic and clinical measures, as well as intervention uptake and treatment success across 6 months. Results: Overall, individuals with less risk of suicide at baseline reported significantly less severe clinical symptoms. Both groups interacted with the intervention at the same rate, but specific use of modules was different. Finally, the impact of intervention usage on outcomes over time did not vary by group. Limitations: While different suicide risk exclusion criteria can change recruited sample characteristics, it remains unclear how these differences impact intervention uptake and success.

Giant pine scale (GPS), Marchalina hellenica Gennadius (Hemiptera: Marchalinidae), is a phloem feeding scale insect endemic to the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, where it primarily feeds on Pinus halepensis and other Pinaceae. In 2014, GPS was detected in the southeast of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, infesting the novel host Pinus radiata. An eradication program was unsuccessful, and with this insect now established within the state, containment and management efforts are underway to stop its spread; however, there remains a need to understand the insect's phenology and behaviour in Australia to better inform control efforts. We documented the annual life cycle and seasonal fluctuations in activity of GPS in Australia over a 32 month period at two contrasting field sites. Onset and duration of life stages were comparable to seasons in Mediterranean conspecifics, although the results imply the timing of GPS life stage progression is broadening or accelerating. GPS density was higher in Australia compared to Mediterranean reports, possibly due to the absence of key natural predators, such as the silver fly, Neoleucopis kartliana Tanasijtshuk (Diptera, Chamaemyiidae). Insect density and honeydew production in the Australian GPS population studied varied among locations and between generations. Although insect activity was well explained by climate, conditions recorded inside infested bark fissures often provided the weakest explanation of GPS activity. Our findings suggest that GPS activity is strongly influenced by climate, and this may in part be related to changes in host quality. An improved understanding of how our changing climate is influencing the phenology of phloem feeding insects such as GPS will help with predictions as to where these insects are likely to flourish and assist with management programs for pest species.", "Keywords": ["climate drivers", "honeydew", "insect density", "phloem-feeders", "seasonal phenology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Duncan D", "Last Name": "Jaroslow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Environment and Evolution, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "School of Applied Systems Biology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David I", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria, Biosecurity and Agricultural Services, Cranbourne, VIC 3977, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Martin J", "Last Name": "Steinbauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Environment and Evolution, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia."}], "Journal": "Insects", "PubDate": "2023Mar21"}, {"PMID": "36881679", "Title": "Volatiles produced by symbiotic yeasts improve trap catches of Carpophilus davidsoni (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae): an important pest of stone fruits in Australia.", "Abstract": "Carpophilus davidsoni (Dobson) is an important pest of Australian stone fruit. Current management practices for this beetle include the use of a trap that contains an attractant lure comprised of aggregation pheromones and a 'co-attractant' mixture of volatiles from fruit juice fermented using Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hansen). We explored whether volatiles from yeasts Pichia kluyveri (Bedford) and Hanseniaspora guilliermondii (Pijper), which are closely associated with C. davidsoni in nature, might improve the effectiveness of the co-attractant. Field trials using live yeast cultures revealed that P. kluyveri trapped higher numbers of C. davidsoni compared to H. guilliermondii, and comparative GC-MS of volatile emissions of the two yeasts led to the selection of isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate for further investigation. In subsequent field trials, trap catches of C. davidsoni were significantly increased when 2-phenylethyl acetate was added to the co-attractant, compared to when isoamyl acetate was added, or both isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate. We also tested different concentrations of ethyl acetate in the co-attractant (the only ester in the original lure) and found contrasting results in cage bioassays and field trails. Our study demonstrates how exploring volatile emissions from microbes that are ecologically associated with insect pests can result in more potent lures for use in integrated pest management strategies.

Waveguides, owing to their tight spatial confinement of the electromagnetic fields and the longer interaction distance, are promising platforms with which to study small volumes of such systems. The efficient input of sub-ps THz pulses into waveguides is challenging owing to the wide bandwidth of the THz signal. Here, we propose a sensing chip comprised of a pair of back-to-back Vivaldi antennas feeding into, and out from, a 90\u00b0 bent slotline waveguide to overcome this problem. The effective operating bandwidth of the sensing chip ranges from 0.2 to 1.15 THz, and the free-space to on-chip coupling efficiency is as high as 51% at 0.44 THz. Over the entire band, the THz signal is \u223c42\u2005dB above the noise level at room temperature, with a peak of \u223c73\u2005dB above the noise. In order to demonstrate the use of the chip, we have measured the characteristic fingerprint of \u03b1-lactose monohydrate, and its sharp absorption peak at \u223c0.53 THz was successfully observed, demonstrating the promise of our technique.

Recognizing this, the Canadian Low-Risk Gambling Guidelines were developed using data from 8 countries to establish the relationship between gambling behaviour and harm. The guidelines include recommended limits on gambling spending as a percentage of income, gambling frequency, and number of types of games played. However, the developers of the LRGG's did not include UK data in their analysis. This study analyzes data from Health Survey England to assess the applicability of the Canadian Low-Risk Gambling Guidelines to gamblers in England. Using HSE data from 2016 to 2018, we generated risk curves for the relationship between 2 dimensions of gambling behaviour-frequency of gambling sessions and number of types of games played-and gambling harm. We defined harm as a score of 1 or above on the Problem Gambling Severity Index. HSE does not include questions on gambling spending, therefore this was not assessed. The relationship observed between frequency and types of gambling and harm among HSE respondents was similar to the risk curves generated for the development of the Canadian LRGG's.

Developing an odour lure that can attract mated female flies under field conditions has presented a major challenge to chemical ecologists around the globe. We have designed a new lure to attract female Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, based on the knowledge that this pest tephritid is attracted not only to odours from ripening fruits, but also to odours of symbiotic (gut-associated) yeasts on which the larvae feed. Initial field trials screened four volatile mixtures, each containing a base mix of three, short-chain \"fruit ripening\" esters and differing in the addition of long-chain \"fruity\" esters and / or alcohols produced by live yeasts. Results demonstrated that the lure formulated from short-chain esters and live yeast alcohols attracted the most female flies, with significantly higher catches than an odourless control trap, and a protein-baited trap. As electrophysiological studies exploring peripheral responses in tephritids to alcohols associated with fermentation have not been extensively investigated, we conducted this work on both the antennae and maxillary palps, and discovered that three yeast alcohols were detected by both sensory organs. Performance trials conducted in pome fruit and stone fruit orchards evaluated the six-component blend of short-chain ester and live yeast alcohol lure against a commercially available synthetic fruit-odour lure and a protein-based lure. In the apple orchard, the new lure caught significantly more female flies, and in particular mated females, compared to the commercially available lures. In the stone fruit orchard, while the new lure again caught the most mated female flies compared to the other lures, differences were not significant. The visual stimulus (trap design) used had a significant effect on capture, with a Ladd trap (red sphere on a yellow panel) being considerably more effective than the other traps. We discuss the implications of this study, including why the degree of effectiveness of the new lure might have differed among the test orchards (citrus, apple, stonefruit), and why yeast odours might increase attractiveness to \"ripening fruit\" volatile blends under field conditions.", "Keywords": ["Bactrocera tryoni", "Female lure", "Mass trapping", "Pest management"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Animals", "Odorants", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Tephritidae", "Reproduction", "Fruit", "Insect Control", "Pheromones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Henneken", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre for AgriBioscience, 5 Ring Rd, Bundoora, VIC, 3083, Australia. jessi.henneken@agriculture.vic.gov.au."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Farnier", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre for AgriBioscience, 5 Ring Rd, Bundoora, VIC, 3083, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John Paul", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre for AgriBioscience, 5 Ring Rd, Bundoora, VIC, 3083, Australia."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical ecology", "PubDate": "2022Dec"}, {"PMID": "36216998", "Title": "Flexible neural control of motor units.", "Abstract": "Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle.

Although this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. In this study, we developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings, in a rhesus macaque, even during rapidly changing forces. Patterns of MU activity were surprisingly behavior-dependent and could be accurately described only by assuming multiple drives. Consistent with flexible descending control, microstimulation of neighboring cortical sites recruited different MUs. Furthermore, the cortical population response displayed sufficient degrees of freedom to potentially exert fine-grained control.

Such analyses require the identification of gene markers for semi-stable transition states. However, there are nontrivial challenges such as unexplainable stochasticity, variable population sizes, and alternative trajectory constructions. By advancing current tipping-point theory-based models with feature selection, network decomposition, accurate estimation of correlations, and optimization, we developed BioTIP to overcome these challenges. BioTIP identifies a small group of genes, called critical transition signal (CTS), to characterize regulated stochasticity during semi-stable transitions. Although methods rooted in different theories converged at the same transition events in two benchmark datasets, BioTIP is unique in inferring lineage-determining transcription factors governing critical transition. Applying BioTIP to mouse gastrulation data, we identify multiple CTSs from one dataset and validated their significance in another independent dataset. We detect the established regulator Etv2 whose expression change drives the haemato-endothelial bifurcation, and its targets together in CTS across three datasets. After comparing to three current methods using six datasets, we show that BioTIP is accurate, user-friendly, independent of pseudo-temporal trajectory, and captures significantly interconnected and reproducible CTSs. We expect BioTIP to provide great insight into dynamic regulations of lineage-determining factors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Gastrula", "Genetic Markers", "Mice", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinan H", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of Chicago,\u00a0Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, The University of Chicago, Chicago IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuxi", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of Chicago,\u00a0Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhezhen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of Chicago,\u00a0Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivan P", "Last Name": "Moskowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of Chicago,\u00a0Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of Chicago,\u00a0Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2022Sep09"}, {"PMID": "35621264", "Title": "Motor cortex activity across movement speeds is predicted by network-level strategies for generating muscle activity.", "Abstract": "Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.", "Keywords": ["dynamical systems", "motor cortex", "movement", "neural networks", "neuroscience", "rhesus macaque", "speed", "tangling"], "MeSH terms": ["Learning", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Muscles", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shreya", "Last Name": "Saxena", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, United States."}, {"First Name": "Abigail A", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022May27"}, {"PMID": "35565717", "Title": "Time for Revival of Bone Biopsy with Histomorphometric Analysis in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Moving from Skepticism to Pragmatism.", "Abstract": "Bone Biopsy (BB) with histomorphometric analysis still represents the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of different forms of renal osteodystrophy. Bone biopsy is the only technique able to provide comprehensive information on all bone parameters, measuring static and dynamic parameters of turnover, cortical and trabecular microarchitecture, and mineralization defects. In nephrological practice, bone biopsy yields relevant indications to support therapeutic choices in CKD, heavily impacting the management and prognosis of uremic patients. Unfortunately, the use of bone biopsy has decreased; a lack of expertise in performing and interpreting, perceived procedure invasiveness and pain, and reimbursement issues have all contributed to this decline. Nevertheless, both bone biomarkers and instrumental images cannot be considered reliable surrogates for histological findings, being insufficiently accurate to properly evaluate underlying mineral and bone disorders. This is a multidisciplinary position paper from the Nephrology and Osteoporosis Italian Scientific Societies with the purpose of restating the role of bone biopsy in CKD patient management and of providing strong solutions to allow diffusion of this technique in Italy, but potentially also in other countries. The Italian approach through the optimization and standardization of bone biopsy procedure, the construction of the Italian Hub and Spoke network, and a request for adjustment and national homogenization of reimbursement to the Italian Health Ministry has led the way to implement bone biopsy and to improve CKD patient management and prognosis.", "Keywords": ["CKD-MBD", "bone biopsy",

Quantity-frequency measures can detect consumption that exceeds levels in the current Australian guidelines (Level B). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most effective screening tool and is recommended for use in primary care and hospital settings. For screening in the general community, the AUDIT-C is a suitable alternative (Level A). Indirect biological markers should be used as an adjunct to screening (Level A), and direct measures of alcohol in breath and/or blood can be useful markers of recent use (Level B). Assessment Assessment should include evaluation of alcohol use and its effects, physical examination, clinical investigations and collateral history taking (Level C). Assessment for alcohol-related physical problems, mental health problems and social support should be undertaken routinely (GPP). Where there are concerns regarding the safety of the patient or others, specialist consultation is recommended (Level C). Assessment should lead to a clear, mutually acceptable treatment plan which specifies interventions to meet the patient's needs (Level D). Sustained abstinence is the optimal outcome for most patients with alcohol dependence (Level C). Chapter 3: Caring for and managing patients with alcohol problems: interventions, treatments, relapse prevention, aftercare, and long term follow-up Brief interventions Brief motivational interviewing interventions are more effective than no treatment for people who consume alcohol at risky levels (Level A). Their effectiveness compared with standard care or alternative psychosocial interventions varies by treatment setting. They are most effective in primary care settings (Level A). Psychosocial interventions Cognitive behaviour therapy should be a first-line psychosocial intervention for alcohol dependence. Its clinical benefit is enhanced when it is combined with pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence or an additional psychosocial intervention (eg, motivational interviewing) (Level A). Motivational interviewing is effective in the short term and in patients with less severe alcohol dependence (Level A). Residential rehabilitation may be of benefit to patients who have moderate-to-severe alcohol dependence and require a structured residential treatment setting (Level D). Alcohol withdrawal management Most cases of withdrawal can be managed in an ambulatory setting with appropriate support (Level B). Tapering diazepam regimens (Level A) with daily staged supply from a pharmacy or clinic are recommended (GPP). Pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence Acamprosate is recommended to help maintain abstinence from alcohol (Level A). Naltrexone is recommended for prevention of relapse to heavy drinking (Level A). Disulfiram is only recommended in close supervision settings where patients are motivated for abstinence (Level A). Some evidence for off-label therapies baclofen and topiramate exists, but their side effect profiles are complex and neither should be a first-line medication (Level B). Peer support programs Peer-led support programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART Recovery are effective at maintaining abstinence or reductions in drinking (Level A). Relapse prevention, aftercare and long-term follow-up Return to problematic drinking is common and aftercare should focus on addressing factors that contribute to relapse (GPP). A harm-minimisation approach should be considered for patients who are unable to reduce their drinking (GPP). Chapter 4: Providing appropriate treatment and care to people with alcohol problems: a summary for key specific populations Gender-specific issues Screen women and men for domestic abuse (Level C). Consider child protection assessments for caregivers with alcohol use disorder (GPP). Explore contraceptive options with women of reproductive age who regularly consume alcohol (Level B). Pregnant and breastfeeding women Advise pregnant and breastfeeding women that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption (Level B). Pregnant women who are alcohol dependent should be admitted to hospital for treatment in an appropriate maternity unit that has an addiction specialist (GPP). Young people Perform a comprehensive HEEADSSS assessment for young people with alcohol problems (Level B). Treatment should focus on tangible benefits of reducing drinking through psychotherapy and engagement of family and peer networks (Level B). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples Collaborate with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health workers, organisations and communities, and seek guidance on patient engagement approaches (GPP). Use validated screening tools and consider integrated mainstream and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander-specific approaches to care (Level B). Culturally and linguistically diverse groups Use an appropriate method, such as the \"teach-back\" technique, to assess the need for language and health literacy support (Level C). Engage with culture-specific agencies as this can improve treatment access and success (Level C). Sexually diverse and gender diverse populations Be mindful that sexually diverse and gender diverse populations experience lower levels of satisfaction, connection and treatment completion (Level C). Seek to incorporate LGBTQ-specific treatment and agencies (Level C). Older people All new patients aged over 50 years should be screened for harmful alcohol use (Level D). Consider alcohol as a possible cause for older patients presenting with unexplained physical or psychological symptoms (Level D). Consider shorter acting benzodiazepines for withdrawal management (Level D). Cognitive impairment Cognitive impairment may impair engagement with treatment (Level A). Perform cognitive screening for patients who have alcohol problems and refer them for neuropsychological assessment if significant impairment is suspected (Level A).", "Keywords": ["Alcohol-related

Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon -- whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity -- and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion.

In this study, we develop a multi-locus non-destructive metabarcoding protocol that allows sensitive detection of agricultural pests, and subsequent confirmation using traditional diagnostic techniques. We validate this protocol for the detection of tomato potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) and Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia) within mock communities and field survey traps.

While our multi-locus approach allowed independent validation of target detection, lack of reference sequences for 18S and 12S restricted its usefulness for estimating diversity in field samples.

Renal osteodystrophy, which describes an alteration of bone morphology, is an important component of this systemic disorder and may explain the elevated risk of fracture which adversely affects morbidity and mortality. The most common form of renal osteodystrophy is high-turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa), which is induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). During the past decade, there has been considerable advances in the management of SHPT, with the introduction of the calcimimetic agents, the optimized use of nutritional and active vitamin D, and the accumulated experience with surgical parathyroidectomy.

Numerical simulations show that the propagation loss of the proposed waveguide can be lower than that of classic hollow metallic rectangular waveguides at terahertz frequencies, benefiting from a significant reduction in Ohmic loss. To facilitate fabrication and characterization, a proof-of-concept 20 to 45\u2005GHz waveguide is demonstrated, which verifies the properties and advantages of the proposed waveguide.

However, it is not a uniform disease and includes several genetic subtypes with different prognoses. ccRCC is also characterized by distinctive metabolic reprogramming. Tobacco smoking (TS) is an established risk factor for ccRCC, with unknown effects on tumor pathobiology.METHODSWe investigated the landscape of ccRCCs and paired normal kidney tissues using integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic, and metallomic approaches in a cohort of white males who were long-term current smokers (LTS) or were never smokers (NS).RESULTSAll 3 Omics domains consistently identified a distinct metabolic subtype of ccRCCs in LTS, characterized by activation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) coupled with reprogramming of the malate-aspartate shuttle and metabolism of aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, and histidine. Cadmium, copper, and inorganic arsenic accumulated in LTS tumors, showing redistribution among intracellular pools, including relocation of copper into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. A gene expression signature based on the LTS metabolic subtype provided prognostic stratification of The Cancer Genome Atlas ccRCC tumors that was independent of genomic alterations.CONCLUSIONThe work identified the TS-related metabolic subtype of ccRCC with vulnerabilities that can be exploited for precision medicine approaches targeting metabolic pathways. The results provided rationale for the development of metabolic biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic applications using evaluation of OXPHOS status. The metallomic analysis revealed the role of disrupted metal homeostasis in ccRCC, highlighting the importance of studying effects of metals from e-cigarettes and environmental exposures.FUNDINGDepartment of Defense, Veteran Administration, NIH, ACS, and University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Metabolism", "Oncology"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma,

Supplemental inputs, such as amino acids and trace metals in the media, are reported to affect cell metabolism and glycosylation; quantifying their effects is essential for effective process development. We aim to present and validate, through a commercially relevant cell culture process, a technique for modeling such effects efficiently. While existing models can predict mAb production or glycosylation dynamics under specific process configurations, adapting them to new processes remains challenging, because it involves modifying the model structure and often requires some mechanistic understanding. Here, a modular modeling technique for adapting an existing model for a fed-batch Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture process without structural modifications or mechanistic insight is presented.

A sample of 321 participants were recruited from Amazon's mTurk crowdsourcing platform for a randomized controlled trial investigating an online gambling intervention. Data from this study was used to examine the influence of socially desirable responding on gambling self-report measures over time. At baseline, self-deception (SD), a factor of socially desirable responding, was significantly higher among males than females and among those with household incomes greater than $20,000 per year. Controlling for demographic variability, mixed effects models examining the relationship between socially desirable responding factors [SD and impression management (IM)] and time were conducted. Among males, there were significant interactions between IM with the NORC DSM-IV screen for gambling problems (NODS) and the gambling symptom assessment scale (G-SAS) scores respectively, over time. In other words, males with higher IM scores, demonstrated less change in NODS and G-SAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up compared to males with lower IM scores. There were no significant interactions in any models among females or among the full sample.

We explore this challenge through experimental taphonomy of nuclei in a living eukaryote and microscale physical and chemical characterization of putative nuclei in embryo-like fossils from the early Ediacaran Weng'an Biota. The fossil nuclei exhibit diverse preservational modes that differ in shape, presence or absence of an inner body and the chemistry of the associated mineralization. The nuclei are not directly fossilized; rather, they manifest as external moulds. Experimental taphonomy of epidermal cells from the common onion (Allium cepa) demonstrates that nuclei are more decay resistant than their host cells, generally maintaining their physical dimensions for weeks to months post-mortem, though under some experimental conditions they exhibit shrinkage and/or become shrouded in microbial biofilms. The fossil and experimental evidence may be rationalized in a single taphonomic pathway of selective mineralization of the cell cytoplasm, preserving an external mould of the nucleus that is itself resistant to both decay and mineral replication.

The current study examined the utility of brief screeners comprised of the AUDIT consumption items for distinguishing lower-severity patients from high severity patients in a cohort of individuals self-referring to specialty alcohol treatment. Participants were adults seeking treatment for alcohol problems (N\u00a0=\u00a0853) at a large public psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada, who completed the full 10-item AUDIT as part of an initial telephone screening with hospital staff. Results of receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that both the AUDIT-C and the AUDIT-3 demonstrated adequate accuracy (area under the curve; AUC\u00a0>\u00a00.85) for distinguishing lower-severity patients (defined as those in AUDIT zones I, II, and III) from high-severity patients (defined as those in AUDIT zone IV).

Molecular analysis of yeasts isolated from the gut of C. davidsoni (prefers ripe fruits) and C. hemipterus (prefers overripe and rotting fruits) revealed that the predominant species were Pichia kluyveri and Hanseniaspora guilliermondii. In olfactory attraction and oviposition trials, adult beetles preferred H. guilliermondii over P. kluyveri, and follow up GC-MS analysis revealed unambiguous differences between the odour profiles of these yeasts. In contrast to behavioural trials, larval feeding assays showed that fruit substrates inoculated with P. kluyveri yielded significantly faster development times, higher pupal mass, and a greater number of adult beetles, compared to H. guilliermondii\u00a0-\u00a0in other words, the lesser preferred yeast (by foraging adults) was more suitable for larval survival. Moreover, whilst larvae of both species survived to adulthood when fed solely on P. kluyveri (i.e. without a fruit substrate), only larvae of C. davidsoni could develop on H. guilliermondii; and only C. davidsoni reached adulthood feeding on a yeast-free fruit substrate.

Most cases occur within 1 to 10 days after starting the drug. We publish a case that occurred on the general medical ward of a patient who had been on cefepime therapy for 4 weeks prior to admission. The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge of this serious condition to general internists as our patient was being managed on the general medical ward. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old female on prolonged intravenous antibiotics for sacral and pelvic osteomyelitis presented with acute encephalopathy and aphasia in the setting of an acute kidney injury. Due to the acute focal neurologic deficit, she was initially admitted as a stroke alert. After a negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was pursued and showed nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). NCSE was likely a result of cefepime therapy in the setting of an acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity should be suspected in any patient on cefepime therapy who develops acute changes in mental status, myoclonus, or evidence of seizures. Risk factors for the disease include older age, renal dysfunction, critical illness, and inappropriate dosing based upon renal function. A high index of suspicion is required and delays in diagnosis are common as there are frequently multiple possible causes for altered mental status in systemically ill patients requiring treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Aged", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Anticonvulsants", "Aphasia", "Brain Diseases", "Cefepime", "Female", "Humans", "Levetiracetam", "Lorazepam", "Osteomyelitis", "Status Epilepticus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine V", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Allyn", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO, USA."}], "Journal": "The American journal of case reports", "PubDate": "2020Mar09"}, {"PMID": "32066490", "Title": "Smartphone-based secondary prevention intervention for university students with unhealthy alcohol use identified by screening: study protocol of a parallel group randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol use is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young people, including university students.

In the terahertz-frequency range, the quantum-cascade laser (QCL) is a high-power source with the potential for high-frequency modulation. However, conventional electronic modulation is limited fundamentally by parasitic device impedance, and so alternative physical processes must be exploited to modulate the QCL gain on ultrafast timescales. Here, we demonstrate an alternative mechanism to modulate the emission from a QCL device, whereby optically-generated acoustic phonon pulses are used to perturb the QCL bandstructure, enabling fast amplitude modulation that can be controlled using the QCL drive current or strain pulse amplitude, to a maximum modulation depth of 6% in our experiment. We show that this modulation can be explained using perturbation theory analysis.

This socially desirable responding bias should be considered when using self-reports in predictive models since it introduces error. Methods: A total of 1711 participants were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform for two randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of brief online interventions for hazardous alcohol use. At baseline, participants completed the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR). Four measures of alcohol use were collected at baseline and follow-up: number of drinks consumed in a typical week, on one occasion, consequences experienced, and amount of perceived risk of injury or illness from alcohol use. Results: As expected, individuals scoring high on the BIDR subscales reported less alcohol use and related behaviors (p\u2009<\u20090.05); however, repeating the analyses for each gender showed no difference for females asked direct questions about the frequency of their alcohol use. Mixed-effects models investigating the interaction of socially desirable responding bias over time on alcohol-related measures showed some significant differences in the amount of change reported depending on BIDR scores. Participants with higher self-deceptive enhancement scores reported less change over time in their ratings of risk of illness or injury (p\u2009=\u20090.001) compared to lower-scoring participants. Likewise, high-scoring participants reported less change in the number of consequences experienced due to alcohol use over time on both BIDR subscales. Neither direct measure of alcohol use seemed affected by BIDR scores over time. A different pattern was found in males and females analyzed separately. Conclusions: These findings suggest that researchers should consider including measures of socially desirable responding bias in longitudinal studies involving self-reported alcohol use, particularly when modeling alcohol-related measures using rating scales across time. In addition, separate gender analyses may be appropriate. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03008928. Registered 30 December 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03060135.

However, the animal embryo interpretation of the main components of the biota has been the subject of controversy [2, 3]. Here, we describe the development of Caveasphaera, which varies in morphology from lensoid to a hollow spheroidal cage [4] to a solid spheroid [5] but has largely evaded description and interpretation. Caveasphaera is demonstrably cellular and develops within an envelope by cell division and migration, first defining the spheroidal perimeter via anastomosing cell masses that thicken and ingress as strands of cells that detach and subsequently aggregate in a polar region. Concomitantly, the overall diameter increases as does the volume of the cell mass, but after an initial phase of reductive palinotomy, the volume of individual cells remains the same through development. The process of cell ingression, detachment, and polar aggregation is analogous to gastrulation; together with evidence of functional cell adhesion and development within an envelope, this is suggestive of a holozoan affinity.

Two modes of delivery were compared: with or without the presence of a research assistant (RA) to make patients aware of the device's presence and help users. Using the device was optional. Methods: The devices were placed in 10 participating primary care practices waiting rooms for 6\u2009weeks, and were accessible on a voluntary basis. Number of appointments by each practice during the course of the study was recorded. Access to the electronic brief intervention was voluntary among those who screened positive.

Results: During the study, there were 7270 appointments and 1511 individuals used the device (20.8%). Mean age of users was 45.3 (19.5), and 57.9% screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use.

While the recent development of standardized molecular diagnostics has partly alleviated this requirement, the single specimen per reaction nature of these methods does not readily scale to the sheer number of insects trapped in surveillance programmes. Consequently, target lists are often restricted to a few high-priority pests, allowing unanticipated species to avoid detection and potentially establish populations. DNA metabarcoding has recently emerged as a method for conducting simultaneous, multi-species identification of complex mixed communities and may lend itself ideally to rapid diagnostics of bulk insect trap samples. Moreover, the high-throughput nature of recent sequencing platforms could enable the multiplexing of hundreds of diverse trap samples on a single flow cell, thereby providing the means to dramatically scale up insect surveillance in terms of both the quantity of traps that can be processed concurrently and number of pest species that can be targeted. In this review of the metabarcoding literature, we explore how DNA metabarcoding could be tailored to the detection of invasive insects in a surveillance context and highlight the unique technical and regulatory challenges that must be considered when implementing high-throughput sequencing technologies into sensitive diagnostic applications.", "Keywords": ["alien species", "bioinformatics", "biosecurity", "biosurveillance", "controls", "early detection", "non-destructive", "quality assurance", "reference database", "validation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Computational Biology", "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic", "Databases, Genetic", "Genetic Markers", "Genome, Insect", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Insecta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Piper", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Batovska", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Noel O I", "Last Name": "Cogan", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John Paul", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Brendan C", "Last Name": "Rodoni", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mark J", "Last Name": "Blacket", "Affiliation": "Agriculture Victoria Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora 3083, VIC, Australia."}], "Journal": "GigaScience", "PubDate": "2019Aug01"}, {"PMID": "31339840", "Title": "Opioid Utilization and Perception of Pain Control in Hospitalized Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study of 11 Sites in 8 Countries.", "Abstract": "Hospitalized patients are frequently treated with opioids for pain control, and receipt of opioids at hospital discharge may increase the risk of future chronic opioid use.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Prescriptions", "Drug Utilization", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Internationality", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Pain Measurement", "Patient Satisfaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marisha", "Last Name": "Burden", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Keniston", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Mary Anderson", "Last Name": "Wallace", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Jason W", "Last Name": "Busse", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Department of Health, Evidence and Impact;

Self-directed treatments provide individuals with information and support to initiate a recovery program without attending formal treatment. In this study, an online version of a previously evaluated telephone-based intervention package is compared to a brief online normative feedback intervention called Check Your Gambling. In a randomized controlled trial design, participants with gambling problems who were not interested in formal treatment (N\u2009=\u2009181) were recruited through media announcements. After a baseline telephone assessment, participants were assigned to have access to either the brief Check Your Gambling, or the extended self-management tools intervention. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months post baseline by blinded interviewers. Participant nominated collaterals were contacted to validate self-reported gambling involvement. The follow-up rate at 12\u00a0months was 78%. Participants in both conditions showed significant reductions in days of gambling and problem severity but no differences between conditions were found, contrary to the primary hypothesis. Lack of previous treatment for gambling and higher baseline self-efficacy predicted fewer days of gambling in both conditions. Self-efficacy increased over time but did not appear to mediate changes in gambling. Participants who were most engaged in the extended online program showed better outcomes. Those with low engagement showed a slower trajectory of change but equivalent improvements by 12\u00a0months. The extended online intervention was not associated with better outcomes than the brief Check Your Gambling intervention.

We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5' untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors.

The onslaught of damage caused by ischaemia and reperfusion, occurring during an acute myocardial infarction and the subsequent reperfusion therapy, can wipe out upwards of a billion cardiomyocytes. A similar program of cell death can cause the irreversible loss of neurons in ischaemic stroke. Similar pathways of lethal cell injury can contribute to other pathologies such as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure caused by cancer therapy. Consequently, strategies designed to protect the heart from lethal cell injury have the potential to be applicable across all three pathologies. The investigators meeting at the 10th Hatter Cardiovascular Institute workshop examined the parallels between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), ischaemic stroke, and other pathologies that cause the loss of cardiomyocytes including cancer therapeutic cardiotoxicity. They examined the prospects for protection by remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) in each scenario, and evaluated impasses and novel opportunities for cellular protection, with the future landscape for RIC in the clinical setting to be determined by the outcome of the large ERIC-PPCI/CONDI2 study. It was agreed that the way forward must include measures to improve experimental methodologies, such that they better reflect the clinical scenario and to judiciously select combinations of therapies targeting specific pathways of cellular death and injury.", "Keywords": ["Anthracycline cardiotoxicity", "Cardioprotection", "Ischaemic stroke", "Myocardial ischaemia", "Neuroprotection", "Reperfusion"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cardiology", "Cytoprotection", "Humans", "Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial", "Medical Oncology", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sean M", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sapna", "Last Name": "Arjun", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Maryna V", "Last Name": "Basalay", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Robert M", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniel I", "Last Name": "Bromage", "Affiliation": "School of Cardiovascular Medicine and Sciences, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence, James Black Centre, 125 Coldharbour Lane, London, SE5 9NU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Hans Erik", "Last Name": "B\u00f8tker", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens Boulevard 99, 8200, Aarhus N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Richard D", "Last Name": "Carr", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Centre for Nephrology, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Arjun K", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Heusch", "Affiliation": "West German Heart and Vascular Center, Institute for Pathophysiology, University of Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Borja", "Last Name": "Ibanez", "Affiliation": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Petra", "Last Name": "Kleinbongard", "Affiliation": "West German Heart and Vascular Center, Institute for Pathophysiology, University of Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sandrine", "Last Name": "Lecour", "Affiliation": "Cardioprotection Group, Hatter Institute for Cardiovascular Research in Africa, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Maddock", "Affiliation": "Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University, Priory Street, Coventry, CV1 5FB, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Ovize", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1060, CarMeN Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon and Service d'explorations Fonctionnelles Cardiovasculaires Groupement Hospitalier Est, 59 Boulevard Pinel, 69500, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Malcolm", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Marlene", "Last Name": "Wiart", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1060, CarMeN Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon and Service d'explorations Fonctionnelles Cardiovasculaires Groupement Hospitalier Est, 59 Boulevard Pinel, 69500, Bron, France."}, {"First Name": "Derek M", "Last Name": "Yellon", "Affiliation": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 67 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK.

A putative neural substrate of motor preparation occurs when a delay separates instruction and execution cues. When readiness is sustained during the delay, sustained neural activity is observed in motor and premotor areas. Yet whether delay-period activity reflects an essential preparatory stage is controversial. In particular, it has remained ambiguous whether delay-period-like activity appears before non-delayed movements. To overcome that ambiguity, we leveraged a recently developed analysis method that parses population responses into putatively preparatory and movement-related components. We examined cortical responses when reaches were initiated after an imposed delay, at a self-chosen time, or reactively with low latency and no delay.

Here, we report coherent measurements of the ultrafast switch-on dynamics, mode competition and frequency selection in a monolithic frequency-tuneable laser using coherent time-domain sampling of the laser emission. This approach allows us to observe hopping between lasing modes on picosecond-timescales and the temporal evolution of transient multi-mode emission into steady-state single mode emission.

Using the fruit fly parasitoid Diachasmimorpha krausii we tested this hypothesis in a series of associative learning experiments which involved the parasitoid, two host fruits (tomatoes and nectarine), and one host fly (Bactrocera tryoni). In sequential Y-tube olfactometer studies, large field-cage studies, and then open field studies, na\u00efve wasps showed a consistent preference for nectarines over tomatoes. The preference for nectarines was retained, but not significantly increased, for wasps which had prior training exposure to nectarines. However, and again consistently at all three spatial scales, prior experience on tomatoes led to significantly increased attraction to this fruit by tomato-trained wasps, including those liberated freely in the environment.

Using the Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) as our model tephritid species, we identified yeast species present in the gut of wild-collected larvae and found two genera, Hanseniaspora and Pichia, were the dominant isolates. In behavioural trials using adult female B. tryoni, a fruit-agar substrate inoculated with Pichia kluyveri resulted in odour emissions that increased the attraction of flies, whereas inoculation with Hanseniaspora uvarum, produced odours that strongly deterred flies, and both yeasts led to decreased oviposition. Larval development trials showed that the fruit-agar substrate inoculated with the 'deterrent odour' yeast species, H. uvarum, resulted in significantly faster larval development and a greater number of adult flies, compared to a substrate inoculated with the 'attractive odour' yeast species, P. kluyveri, and a yeast free control substrate. GC-MS analysis of volatiles emitted by H. uvarum and P. kluyveri inoculated substrates revealed significant quantitative differences in ethyl-, isoamyl-, isobutyl-, and phenethyl- acetates, which may be responsible for the yeast-specific olfactory responses of adult flies. We discuss how our seemingly counterintuitive finding that female B. tryoni flies avoid a beneficial yeast fits well with our understanding of female choice of oviposition sites, and how the contrasting behavioural effects of H. uvarum and P. kluyveri raises interesting questions regarding the role of yeast-specific volatiles as cues to insect vectors.

Rapid optogenetic silencing and electrical stimulation indicated that short-latency pathways linking motor cortex with spinal motor neurons are selectively activated during one behavior. Analysis of motor cortical activity revealed a dramatic change between behaviors in the coordination of firing patterns across neurons that could account for this differential influence.

We demonstrate the sensitivity of this technique by measuring a homologous alcohol series across the 0.1-0.8 THz frequency range.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Swithenbank", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Burnett", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Lianhe H", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Alexander Giles", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Edmund H", "Last Name": "Linfield", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Christopher D", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and \u2021School of Chemistry, University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "Journal": "Analytical chemistry", "PubDate": "2017Aug01"}, {"PMID": "28521035", "Title": "Beyond Quitting: Any Additional Impact of Mailing Free Nicotine Patches to Current Smokers?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Nicotine", "Pharmaceutical Services", "Postal Service", "Smoking", "Tobacco Use Cessation Devices", "Tobacco Use Disorder"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Vladyslav", "Last Name": "Kushnir", "Affiliation": "Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Selby", "Affiliation": "Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rachel F", "Last Name": "Tyndale", "Affiliation": "Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Laurie", "Last Name": "Zawertailo", "Affiliation": "Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Scott T", "Last Name": "Leatherdale", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and Health Systems, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada."}], "Journal": "Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco", "PubDate": "2018Apr02"}, {"PMID": "28486752", "Title": "Exosomes contribute to endothelial integrity and acute chest syndrome risk: Preliminary findings.", "Abstract": "Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of death among children with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

High-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) is the most frequent, aggressive, extracranial solid tumour in childhood. Using HR-NB as a platform, we performed a network analysis of transcriptome data and presented a c-Myc subnetwork enriched for genes previously reported as ESC-like cancer signatures. A subsequent drug-gene interaction analysis identified a pharmacogenomic agent that preferentially interacted with this HR-NB-specific, ESC-like signature. This agent, Roniciclib (BAY 1000394), inhibited neuroblastoma cell growth and induced apoptosis in vitro. It also repressed the expression of the oncogene c-Myc and the neural ESC marker CDK2 in vitro, which was accompanied by altered expression of the c-Myc-targeted cell cycle regulators CCND1, CDKN1A and CDKN2D in a time-dependent manner. Further investigation into this HR-NB-specific ESC-like signature in 295 and 243 independent patients revealed and validated the general prognostic index of CDK2 and CDKN3 compared with CDKN2D and CDKN1B. These findings highlight the very potent therapeutic benefits of Roniciclib in HR-NB through the targeting of c-Myc-regulated, ESC-like tumorigenesis.

Such coupled cavity lasers comprise a lasing cavity and a tuning cavity which are optically coupled through a narrow air slit and are operated above and below the lasing threshold current, respectively. The emission frequency of these devices is determined by the Vernier resonance of longitudinal modes in the lasing and the tuning cavities, and can be tuned by applying an index perturbation in the tuning cavity. The spectral coverage of the coupled cavity devices have been increased by reducing the repetition frequency of the Vernier resonance and increasing the ratio of the free spectral ranges of the two cavities. A continuous tuning of the coupled cavity modes has been realized through an index perturbation of the lasing cavity itself by using wide electrical heating pulses at the tuning cavity and exploiting thermal conduction through the monolithic substrate. Single mode emission and discrete frequency tuning over a bandwidth of 100 GHz and a quasi-continuous frequency coverage of 7 GHz at 2.25 THz is demonstrated. An improvement in the side mode suppression and a continuous spectral coverage of 3 GHz is achieved without any degradation of output power by integrating a \u03c0-phase shifted photonic lattice in the laser cavity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Iman", "Last Name": "Kundu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Valavanis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lianhe", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edmund H", "Last Name": "Linfield", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "A Giles", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Optics express", "PubDate": "2017Jan09"}, {"PMID": "28039798", "Title": "Mailed distribution of free nicotine patches without behavioral support: Predictors of use and cessation.", "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that the mailed distribution of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), usually as part of smokers' helplines, can been effective in increasing the odds of cessation on a population level.

However, it is very challenging to detect and quantify mTOR signaling noninvasively in clinically relevant animal models of disease or man. We hypothesized that a nuclear imaging tool measuring intracellular mTOR activity could address this unmet need.Experimental Design: Although the biochemical activity of mTOR is not directly amenable to nuclear imaging probe development, we show that the transferrin receptor can be used to indirectly measure intracellular changes in mTOR activity.Results: After verifying that the uptake of radiolabeled transferrin (the soluble ligand of the transferrin receptor) is stimulated by active mTORC1 in vitro, we showed that 89Zr-labeled transferrin (Tf) can measure mTORC1 signaling dynamics in normal and cancerous mouse tissues with PET. Finally, we show that 89Zr-Tf can detect the upregulation of mTORC1 by tumor cells to escape the antitumor effects of a standard-of-care antiandrogen, which is to our knowledge the first example of applying PET to interrogate the biology of treatment resistant cancer.Conclusions: In summary, we have developed the first quantitative assay to provide a comprehensive measurement of mTOR signaling dynamics in vivo, in specific normal tissues, and during tumor development in genetically engineered animal models using a nuclear imaging tool that is readily translatable to man.

Modern clock analyses do not predict the presence of the crown-representatives of most animal phyla in the Neoproterozoic. Furthermore, despite challenges provided by incomplete preservation, a paucity of phylogenetically informative characters, and uncertain expectations of the anatomy of early animals, a number of Neoproterozoic fossils can reasonably be interpreted as metazoans.

One often wishes to compute quantitative summaries of such structure-a basic example is the frequency spectrum-and compare with model-based predictions. The advent of large-scale population recordings affords the opportunity to do so in new ways, with the hope of distinguishing between potential explanations for why responses vary with time. We introduce a method that assesses a basic but previously unexplored form of population-level structure: when data contain responses across multiple neurons, conditions, and times, they are naturally expressed as a third-order tensor. We examined tensor structure for multiple datasets from primary visual cortex (V1) and primary motor cortex (M1). All V1 datasets were 'simplest' (there were relatively few degrees of freedom) along the neuron mode, while all M1 datasets were simplest along the condition mode. These differences could not be inferred from surface-level response features. Formal considerations suggest why tensor structure might differ across modes. For idealized linear models, structure is simplest across the neuron mode when responses reflect external variables, and simplest across the condition mode when responses reflect population dynamics. This same pattern was present for existing models that seek to explain motor cortex responses. Critically, only dynamical models displayed tensor structure that agreed with the empirical M1 data. These results illustrate that tensor structure is a basic feature of the data. For M1 the tensor structure was compatible with only a subset of existing models.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Computer Simulation", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Haplorhini", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Nerve Net", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey S", "Last Name": "Seely", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew T", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Program,Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen I", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Krishna V", "Last Name": "Shenoy", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Program,Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016Nov"}, {"PMID": "27807345", "Title": "Reorganization between preparatory and movement population responses in motor cortex.", "Abstract": "Neural populations can change the computation they perform on very short timescales. Although such flexibility is common, the underlying computational strategies at the population level remain unknown. To address this gap, we examined population responses in motor cortex during reach preparation and movement. We found that there exist exclusive and orthogonal population-level subspaces dedicated to preparatory and movement computations. This orthogonality yielded a reorganization in response correlations: the set of neurons with shared response properties changed completely between preparation and movement. Thus, the same neural population acts, at different times, as two separate circuits with very different properties. This finding is not predicted by existing motor cortical models, which predict overlapping preparation-related and movement-related subspaces.

Here, we describe and validate a new method for rearing the parasitoid wasp, Diachasmimorpha kraussii, which attacks some of the world's worst fruit fly pests and is an internationally used biological control agent. Our method differs from standard culturing approaches by presenting adult wasps with host-infested artificial media within a \"culturing bag,\" which mimics a natural (fruit) oviposition substrate. In laboratory trials using wild collected D. kraussii, the culturing bag method was compared to the use of host-infested nectarines, and a commonly used laboratory method of presenting host-infested artificial media within Petri dishes. The culturing bag method proved to be a significant improvement on both methods, combining the advantages of high host survival in artificial media with parasitism levels that were the equivalent to those recorded using host-infested fruits. In our field study, culturing bags infested with the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, and hung in a mixed peach and nectarine orchard proved to be effective \"artificial fruits\" attracting wild D. kraussii for oviposition. Significantly more adult wasps were reared from the culturing bags compared to field collected fruits. This was shown to be due to higher fruit fly larval density in the bags, as similar percentage parasitism rates were found between the culturing bags and ripe fruits. We discuss how this cheap, time-efficient method could be applied to collecting and monitoring wild D. kraussii populations in orchards, and assist in maintaining genetic variability in parasitoid laboratory cultures.", "Keywords": ["Bactrocera", "Tephritidae", "biological control", "fruit fly", "mass rearing", "natural enemies", "wasp"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Culture Techniques", "Female", "Male", "Pest Control, Biological", "Tephritidae", "Wasps"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ayad", "Last Name": "Masry", "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Environmental and Biological Sciences School, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Furlong", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, the University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Anthony R", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Environmental and Biological Sciences School, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John Paul", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Environmental and Biological Sciences School, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "Journal": "Insect science", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "27586434", "Title": "Do Fruit Ripening Volatiles Enable Resource Specialism in Polyphagous Fruit Flies?", "Abstract": "Frugivorous tephritid fruit flies have lineages with high levels of host generalism. These insects use olfaction to locate fruits, but how they are able to recognize the odors of so many different host species is poorly understood. We used a series of behavioral experiments to investigate the role of fruit ripening volatiles as host cues in the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), a polyphagous pest in Australia. Odors of mature guava (Psidium guajava) attracted female and male flies more strongly than three other ripening stages and guava pulp. We analyzed volatiles from guava odor and selected eleven compounds, all of which elicited an electrophysiological response in the antenna of female flies. Three of these, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and ethyl propionate, were released at the highest rates from the most attractive ripening stage. In behavioral trials, these three esters were not attractive individually, whereas a combination was necessary and sufficient in attracting female flies. The three-component blend was as attractive as the entire 11-component blend, which without these key volatiles was not attractive. Moreover, injecting low ranking hosts (squash and cucumber) with the three volatiles increased attraction in ovipositing female flies. These fruit flies are classed as generalists, but like many polyphagous insects they could be regarded as resource specialists, preferring specific plant reproductive stages with predictable odor cues. Exploring olfaction from this perspective could improve our understanding of host choice in polyphagous insects, and the selection of volatiles to be used as attractants in insect pest management.", "Keywords": ["Bactrocera tryoni", "Host plant", "Olfaction", "Pest management", "Polyphagous"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Fruit", "Insect Control", "Male", "Odorants", "Oviposition", "Psidium", "Smell", "Tephritidae", "Volatile Organic Compounds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John Paul", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport & Resources, Biosciences Research, AgriBio Centre, 5 Ring Road, Bundoora, VIC, 3083, Australia. paul.cunningham@ecodev.vic.gov.au."}, {"First Name": "Mikael A", "Last Name": "Carlsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, 106 91, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Tommaso F", "Last Name": "Villa", "Affiliation": "Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point, Brisbane, QLD, 4001, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Teun", "Last Name": "Dekker", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Protection Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural Science, Alnarp, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Anthony R", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point, Brisbane, QLD, 4001, Australia."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical ecology", "PubDate": "2016Sep"}, {"PMID": "27549786", "Title": "Investigating Patterns of Participation in an Online Support Group for Problem Drinking: a Social Network Analysis.", "Abstract": "This study contributes to emerging literature on online health networks by modeling communication patterns between members of a moderated online support group for problem drinking.

In practice, the decoder is often learned by updating its parameters while the user performs a task. When the user's intention is not directly observable, recent methods have demonstrated value in training the decoder against a surrogate for the user's intended movement. Here we show that training a decoder in this way is a novel variant of an imitation learning problem, where an oracle or expert is employed for supervised training in lieu of direct observations, which are not available. Specifically, we describe how a generic imitation learning meta-algorithm, dataset aggregation (DAgger), can be adapted to train a generic brain-computer interface. By deriving existing learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces in this framework, we provide a novel analysis of regret (an important metric of learning efficacy) for brain-computer interfaces. This analysis allows us to characterize the space of algorithmic variants and bounds on their regret rates. Existing approaches for decoder learning have been performed in the cursor control setting, but the available design principles for these decoders are such that it has been impossible to scale them to naturalistic settings. Leveraging our findings, we then offer an algorithm that combines imitation learning with optimal control, which should allow for training of arbitrary effectors for which optimal control can generate goal-oriented control. We demonstrate this novel and general BCI algorithm with simulated neuroprosthetic control of a 26 degree-of-freedom model of an arm, a sophisticated and realistic end effector.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Arm", "Brain-Computer Interfaces", "Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Learning", "Robotics", "Supervised Machine Learning", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Josh", "Last Name": "Merel", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Carlson", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Liam", "Last Name": "Paninski", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "27189346", "Title": "Pauci Immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient with T-cell lymphoma and argyria.", "Abstract": "Silver is a transition metal, toxic when ingested in significant amounts, causing argyria (skin deposition) and argyrosis (eye deposition).

The aim of this study was to examine gender differences within a sample of problem gamblers motivated to quit with or without formal treatment, and further, to explore the interactions between gender, shame and guilt-proneness, and autonomous versus controlled reasons for change. Motivation for change and self-conscious emotional traits were analyzed for 207 adult problem gamblers with an interest in quitting or reducing their gambling (96.6\u00a0% not receiving treatment).

Controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, general linear models revealed that autonomous motivation for change was associated with higher guilt-proneness, greater problem gambling severity, and the preparation stage of change; whereas controlled forms of motivation were significantly associated with higher shame-proneness and greater problem gambling severity.

However, these GP advances have not been well extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests three novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional inputs, for models with additive and multiplicative kernels. First we present a new method for inference in additive GPs, showing a novel connection between the classic backfitting method and the Bayesian framework. We extend this model using two advances: a variant of projection pursuit regression, and a Laplace approximation for non-Gaussian observations. Lastly, for multiplicative kernel structure, we present a novel method for GPs with inputs on a multidimensional grid. We illustrate the power of these three advances on several data sets, achieving performance equal to or very close to the naive GP at orders of magnitude less cost.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elad", "Last Name": "Gilboa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yunus", "Last Name": "Saat\u00e7i", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "PubDate": "2015Feb"}, {"PMID": "26322701", "Title": "Surgery Versus Nonsurgical Treatment of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Decompression, Surgical", "Female", "Humans", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Male", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Spinal Stenosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Robertson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William R", "Last Name": "Sears", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annals of internal medicine", "PubDate": "2015Sep01"}, {"PMID": "26306050", "Title": "DEVELOPMENTAL PALEOBIOLOGY OF THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.", "Abstract": "Studies of the development of organisms can reveal crucial information on homology of structures. Developmental data are not peculiar to living organisms, and they are routinely preserved in the mineralized tissues that comprise the vertebrate skeleton, allowing us to obtain direct insight into the developmental evolution of this most formative of vertebrate innovations. The pattern of developmental processes is recorded in fossils as successive stages inferred from the gross morphology of multiple specimens and, more reliably and routinely, through the ontogenetic stages of development seen in the skeletal histology of individuals. Traditional techniques are destructive and restricted to a 2-D plane with the third dimension inferred. Effective non-invasive methods of visualizing paleohistology to reconstruct developmental stages of the skeleton are necessary. In a brief survey of paleohistological techniques we discuss the pros and cons of these methods. The use of tomographic methods to reconstruct development of organs is exemplified by the study of the placoderm dentition. Testing evidence for the presence of teeth in placoderms, the first jawed vertebrates, we compare the methods that have been used. These include inferring the development from morphology, and using serial sectioning, microCT or synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to reconstruct growth stages and directions of growth. The ensuing developmental interpretations are biased by the methods and degree of inference. The most direct and reliable method is using SRXTM data to trace sclerochronology.

An important prediction of neural dynamical models is that previously observed neural activity is informative of noisy yet-to-be-observed activity on single-trials, and may thus have a denoising effect. To investigate this prediction, we built and characterized dynamical models of single-trial motor cortical activity. We find these models capture salient dynamical features of the neural population and are informative of future neural activity on single trials. To assess how neural dynamics may beneficially denoise single-trial neural activity, we incorporate neural dynamics into a brain-machine interface (BMI). In online experiments, we find that a neural dynamical BMI achieves substantially higher performance than its non-dynamical counterpart.

Some of the most promising candidates for Precambrian animals occur in the Weng'an biota of South China, including a suite of tubular fossils assigned to Sinocyclocyclicus, Ramitubus, Crassitubus and Quadratitubus, that have been interpreted as soft-bodied eumetazoans comparable to tabulate corals. Here, we present new insights into the anatomy, original composition and phylogenetic affinities of these taxa based on data from synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy, ptychographic nanotomography, scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. The patterns of deformation observed suggest that the cross walls of Sinocyclocyclicus and Quadratitubus were more rigid than those of Ramitubus and Crassitubus. Ramitubus and Crassitubus specimens preserve enigmatic cellular clusters at terminal positions in the tubes. Specimens of Sinocyclocyclicus and Ramitubus have biological features that might be cellular tissue or subcellular structures filling the spaces between the cross walls. These observations are incompatible with a cnidarian interpretation, in which the spaces between cross walls are abandoned parts of the former living positions of the polyp.

Often it is assumed that single-neuron responses reflect a preference for a particular movement or movement variable. It may be further assumed that movement is generated by (or at least accompanied by) a growing population-level preference for the relevant movement. This view has been attractive because it provides a canonical form for the single neuron, a link between preparatory and movement activity, a way of interpreting the population response, and a platform for designing analyses and couching hypotheses. However, this traditional view yields predictions that are at odds with basic features of the data.

The therapeutic use of calcimimetic agents, together with a better understanding of the pivotal role of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the physiological regulation of parathyroid gland function, substantially advanced the management of hyperparathyroidism in dialysis practice. Calcimimetics bind selectively to the CaSR receptor in parathyroid tissue and enhance the inhibitory effect of extracellular calcium ions on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, thereby reducing PTH levels even when serum calcium concentrations are normal or low. The availability of calcimimetic agents for clinical use has opened a new era in the management of patients with SHPT. Indeed, calcimimetic compounds have been shown to reduce PTH levels and to lower serum calcium concentrations in all forms of hyperparathyroidism, including primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and parathyroid carcinoma. Such findings underscore the critical importance of the CaSR as a therapeutic target in this family of clinical disorders.

Small to moderate effect sizes have been reported for interventions targeting depression, anxiety and alcohol use, and smoking interventions have shown large effects. The addition of human support to depression and anxiety interventions has generally resulted in larger treatments effects, but this trend has not been observed in trials of interventions targeting alcohol use. There is some evidence that online interventions can be as effective as face-to-face therapies, at least for anxiety disorders.

Whereas the majority of nonpest heliothinae specialize on a single plant family, genus, or species, pest species are highly polyphagous, with populations often escalating in size as they move from one crop species to another. Here, we examine the current literature on heliothine host-selection behavior with the aim of providing a knowledge base for research scientists and pest managers. We review the host relations of pest heliothines, with a particular focus on Helicoverpa armigera (H\u00fcbner), the most economically damaging of all heliothine species. We then consider the important question of what constitutes a host plant in these moths, and some of the problems that arise when trying to determine host plant status from empirical studies on host use. The top six host plant families in the two main Australian pest species (H. armigera and Helicoverpa punctigera Wallengren) are the same and the top three (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Malvaceae) are ranked the same (in terms of the number of host species on which eggs or larvae have been identified), suggesting that these species may use similar cues to identify their hosts. In contrast, for the two key pest heliothines in the Americas, the Fabaceae contains approximately 1/3 of hosts for both. For Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), the remaining hosts are more evenly distributed, with Solanaceae next, followed by Poaceae, Asteraceae, Malvaceae, and Rosaceae. For Heliothis virescens (F.), the next highest five families are Malvaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, Convolvulaceae, and Scrophulariaceae. Again there is considerable overlap in host use at generic and even species level. H. armigera is the most widely distributed and recorded from 68 plant families worldwide, but only 14 families are recorded as a containing a host in all geographic areas. A few crop hosts are used throughout the range as expected, but in some cases there are anomalies, perhaps because host plant relation studies are not comparable. Studies on the attraction of heliothines to plant odors are examined in the context of our current understanding of insect olfaction, with the aim of better understanding the connection between odor perception and host choice. Finally, we discuss research into sustainable management of pest heliothines using knowledge of heliothine behavior and ecology. A coordinated international research effort is needed to advance our knowledge on host relations in widely distributed polyphagous species instead of the localized, piecemeal approaches to understanding these insects that has been the norm to date.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Food Chain", "Food Preferences", "Insect Control", "Larva", "Learning", "Moths", "Smell", "Species Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John Paul", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myron P", "Last Name": "Zalucki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of economic entomology", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}, {"PMID": "24977908", "Title": "Discrete Vernier tuning in terahertz quantum cascade lasers using coupled cavities.", "Abstract": "Discrete Vernier frequency tuning of terahertz quantum cascade lasers is demonstrated using a device comprising a two-section coupled-cavity.

The resulting thermally-induced shift in the longitudinal cavity modes of the tuning section is engineered to produce either a controllable blue shift or red shift of the emission frequency. This discrete Vernier frequency tuning far exceeds the tuning achievable from standard ridge lasers, and does not lead to any corresponding change in emitted power.

Current polarization imaging employ four different pixelated polarization filters, commonly referred to as division of focal plane polarization sensors. The sensors capture only partial information of the true scene, leading to a loss of spatial resolution as well as inaccuracy of the captured polarization information. Interpolation is a standard technique to recover the missing information and increase the accuracy of the captured polarization information. Here we focus specifically on Gaussian process regression as a way to perform a statistical image interpolation, where estimates of sensor noise are used to improve the accuracy of the estimated pixel information. We further exploit the inherent grid structure of this data to create a fast exact algorithm that operates in \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd(N(3/2)) (vs. the naive \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd (N\u00b3)), thus making the Gaussian process method computationally tractable for image data. This modeling advance and the enabling computational advance combine to produce significant improvements over previously published interpolation methods for polarimeters, which is most pronounced in cases of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

How these key cellular processes, such as metabolism and protein synthesis, crosstalk to fuel cancer cell growth is unknown. Here, we uncover the mechanism by which the Myc oncogene coordinates the production of the two most abundant classes of cellular macromolecules, proteins, and nucleic acids in cancer cells. We find that a single rate-limiting enzyme, phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2), promotes increased nucleotide biosynthesis in Myc-transformed cells. Remarkably, Prps2 couples protein and nucleotide biosynthesis through a specialized cis-regulatory element within the Prps2 5' UTR, which is controlled by the oncogene and translation initiation factor eIF4E downstream Myc activation. We demonstrate with a Prps2 knockout mouse that the nexus between protein and nucleotide biosynthesis controlled by PRPS2 is crucial for Myc-driven tumorigenesis. Together, these studies identify a translationally anchored anabolic circuit critical for cancer cell survival and an unexpected vulnerability for \"undruggable\" oncogenes, such as Myc.

Specific dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in liver is sufficient to cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; this is seen by a selective inability of insulin to suppress glucose production while remaining insulin-sensitive to de novo lipid biosynthesis. We have previously shown that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) controls diabetic-linked glucose and lipid metabolism gene sets in skeletal muscle, but whether liver YY1-targeted metabolic genes impact a diabetic phenotype is unknown. Here we show that decreased genetic dosage of YY1 in liver causes insulin resistance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dyslipidemia. Indeed, YY1 liver-specific heterozygous mice exhibit blunted activation of hepatic insulin signaling in response to insulin. Mechanistically, YY1, through direct recruitment to promoters, functions as a suppressor of genes encoding for metabolic enzymes of the gluconeogenic and lipogenic pathways and as an activator of genes linked to fatty acid oxidation.

The high mortality associated with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic epithelium justifies the broadest possible search for new biomarkers that can facilitate early detection or monitor treatment efficacy. Protein glycosylation is altered in many cancers, leading many to propose that glycoproteomic changes may provide suitable biomarkers. In order to assess this possibility for pancreatic cancer, we have performed an in-depth LC-MS/MS analysis of the proteome and MS(n)-based characterization of the N-linked glycome of a small set of pancreatic ductal fluid obtained from normal, pancreatitis, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Our results identify a set of seven proteins that were consistently increased in cancer ductal fluid compared to normal (AMYP, PRSS1, GP2-1, CCDC132, REG1A, REG1B, and REG3A) and one protein that was consistently decreased (LIPR2). These proteins are all directly or indirectly associated with the secretory pathway in normal pancreatic cells. Validation of these changes in abundance by Western blotting revealed increased REG protein glycoform diversity in cancer. Characterization of the total N-linked glycome of normal, IPMN, and adenocarcinoma ductal fluid clustered samples into three discrete groups based on the prevalence of six dominant glycans. Within each group, the profiles of less prevalent glycans were able to distinguish normal from cancer on this small set of samples. Our results emphasize that individual variation in protein glycosylation must be considered when assessing the value of a glycoproteomic marker, but also indicate that glycosylation diversity across human subjects can be reduced to simpler clusters of individuals whose N-linked glycans share structural features.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Body Fluids", "Carbohydrate Metabolism", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase", "Glycomics", "Humans", "Pancreas", "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins", "Proteome", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mindy", "Last Name": "Porterfield", "Affiliation": "Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, \u2021Chemistry Department, and \u00a7Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Georgia , Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Haiyong", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuhiro", "Last Name": "Aoki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel D", "Last Name": "Von Hoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Demeure", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Tiemeyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lance", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of proteome research", "PubDate": "2014Feb07"}, {"PMID": "24314204", "Title": "Exploratory randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a waiting list control design.", "Abstract": "Employing waiting list control designs in psychological and behavioral intervention research may artificially inflate intervention effect estimates.

From these calculations, we find that each spectrum is dominated by three translatory modes involving asymmetric motion of the ammonium cation and bromine counterion, although the overall number of active modes increases with increasing molecular size. The experimentally observed absorption is not completely described by the infrared active phonon modes alone.

Here we tested that hypothesis using antibody-lectin sandwich arrays in broad screens of protein glycoforms and in targeted studies of candidate markers. We profiled 16 different glycoforms of proteins captured by 72 different antibodies in cyst fluid from mucinous and nonmucinous cysts (n = 22), and we then tested a three-marker panel in 22 addition samples and 22 blinded samples. Glycan alterations were not widespread among the proteins and were mainly confined to MUC5AC and endorepellin. Specific glycoforms of these proteins, defined by reactivity with wheat germ agglutinin and a blood group H antibody, were significantly elevated in mucinous cysts, whereas the core protein levels were not significantly elevated. A three-marker panel based on these glycoforms distinguished mucinous from nonmucinous cysts with 93% accuracy (89% sensitivity, 100% specificity) in a prevalidation sample set (n = 44) and with 91% accuracy (87% sensitivity, 100% specificity) in independent, blinded samples (n = 22). Targeted lectin measurements and mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the higher wheat germ agglutinin and blood group H reactivity was due to oligosaccharides terminating in GlcNAc or N-acetyl-lactosamine with occasional \u03b11,2-linked fucose.

This outcome has facilitated new advances in disease-specific transplant regimens that seek to amplify the antitumor effects of the allograft, while reducing transplant-related mortality. However, disease relapse remains the preeminent challenge to the success of transplantation as a modality for successful treatment of high-risk disease.

We have interrogated the putative therapeutic targets associated with the transcription factor Grainy head-like 2 (GRHL2), a critical epithelial regulatory factor. We demonstrate the possibility to define the molecular functions of critical genes in terms of their personalized expression profiles, allowing appropriate functional conclusions to be derived. A novel methodology, relative expression analysis with gene-set pairs (RXA-GSP), is designed to explore the potential clinical utility of cancer-biology discovery. Observing that Grhl2-overexpression leads to increased metastatic potential in vitro, we established a model assuming Grhl2-induced or -inhibited genes confer poor or favorable prognosis respectively for cancer metastasis. Training on public gene expression profiles of 995 breast cancer patients, this method prioritized one gene-set pair (GRHL2, CDH2, FN1, CITED2, MKI67 versus CTNNB1 and CTNNA3) from all 2717 possible gene-set pairs (GSPs). The identified GSP significantly dichotomized 295 independent patients for metastasis-free survival (log-rank tested p\u200a=\u200a0.002; severe empirical p\u200a=\u200a0.035). It also showed evidence of clinical prognostication in another independent 388 patients collected from three studies (log-rank tested p\u200a=\u200a3.3e-6). This GSP is independent of most traditional prognostic indicators, and is only significantly associated with the histological grade of breast cancer (p\u200a=\u200a0.0017), a GRHL2-associated clinical character (p\u200a=\u200a6.8e-6, Spearman correlation), suggesting that this GSP is reflective of GRHL2-mediated events. Furthermore, a literature review indicates the therapeutic potential of the identified genes. This research demonstrates a novel strategy to integrate both biological experiments and clinical gene expression profiles for extracting and elucidating the genomic impact of a novel factor, GRHL2, and its associated gene-sets on the breast cancer prognosis. Importantly, the RXA-GSP method helps to individualize breast cancer treatment.

Haploinsufficiency of the highly conserved ortholog, cut, led to hemocyte overgrowth and tumor formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Similarly, haploinsufficiency of CUX1 gave human hematopoietic cells a significant engraftment advantage on transplantation into immunodeficient mice.
