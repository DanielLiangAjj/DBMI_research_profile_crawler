We previously uncovered a role for the GckIII pathway in Drosophila melanogaster tracheal (respiratory) tube morphology. The trachea form a network of branched epithelial tubes essential for oxygen transport, and are structurally analogous to branched tubular organs in vertebrates, such as the vascular system. In the absence of GckIII pathway function, aberrant dilations form in tracheal tubes characterized by mislocalized junctional and apical proteins, suggesting that the pathway is important in maintaining tube integrity in development. Here, we observed a genetic interaction between trc and Cerebral cavernous malformations 3 (Ccm3), the Drosophila ortholog of a human vascular disease gene, supporting our hypothesis that the GckIII pathway functions downstream of Ccm3 in trachea, and potentially in the vertebrate cerebral vasculature. However, how GckIII pathway signaling is regulated and the mechanisms that underpin its function in tracheal development are unknown. We undertook biochemical and genetic approaches to identify proteins that interact with Trc, the most downstream GckIII pathway kinase. We found that known GckIII and NDR scaffold proteins are likely to control GckIII pathway signaling in tracheal development, consistent with their conserved roles in Hippo-like modules. Furthermore, we show genetic interactions between trc and multiple enzymes in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting a potential function of the GckIII pathway in integrating cellular energy requirements with maintenance of tube integrity.", "Keywords": ["CCM3", "NDR", "hippo-like", "metabolism", "trachea"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Germinal Center Kinases", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sayantanee", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA 02125, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexey", "Last Name": "Veraksa", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA 02125, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amin", "Last Name": "Ghabrial", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kieran F", "Last Name": "Harvey", "Affiliation": "Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Carole", "Last Name": "Poon", "Affiliation": "Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia."}], "Journal": "G3 (Bethesda, Md.)", "PubDate": "2023Mar09"}, {"PMID": "36111596", "Title": "Regulation of Archease by the mTOR-vATPase axis.", "Abstract": "Larval terminal cells of the Drosophila tracheal system generate extensive branched tubes, requiring a huge increase in apical membrane.

We show that the steady-state subcellular localization of Archease is principally nuclear and dependent upon TOR-vATPase activity. In tracheal cells mutant for Rheb or vATPase loci, Archease localization shifted dramatically from nucleus to cytoplasm.

We find that Ich regulates seamless tubulogenesis via its role in promoting the formation of a mature apical extracellular matrix (aECM) lining the lumen of the seamless tubes. We determined that ich encodes a zinc finger protein (CG11966) that acts, as a transcriptional activator required for the expression of multiple aECM factors, including a novel membrane-anchored trypsin protease (CG8213).

In the Drosophila tracheal system, mutations in oak gall (okg) and conjoined (cnj) confer identical defects, including late onset blockage near the terminal cell-stalk cell junction and the ectopic extension of autocellular, seamed tubes into the terminal cell. We determined that okg and cnj encode the E and G subunits of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and showed that both the V0 and V1 domains are required for terminal cell morphogenesis. Remarkably, the ectopic seamed tubes running along vATPase-deficient terminal cells belonged to the neighboring stalk cells. All vATPase-deficient tracheal cells had reduced apical domains and terminal cells displayed mislocalized apical proteins. Consistent with recent reports that the mTOR and vATPase pathways intersect, we found that mTOR pathway mutants phenocopied okg and cnj. Furthermore, terminal cells depleted for the apical determinants Par6 or aPKC had identical ectopic seamed tube defects.

We show that braided encodes Syntaxin7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab5, Vps45, and Rabenosyn-5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping seamless tube lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided seamless tube cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed seamless tube cyst formation and restored terminal branching.
