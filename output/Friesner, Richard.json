However, before FEP can be deployed prospectively, it must demonstrate retrospective recapitulation of known experimental data where the subtle details of the atomic ligand-receptor model are consequential. An open question is whether AlphaFold models can serve as useful initial models for FEP in the regime where there exists a congeneric series of known chemical matter but where no experimental structures are available either of the target or of close homologues. As AlphaFold structures are provided without a bound ligand, we employ induced fit docking to refine the AlphaFold models in the presence of one or more congeneric ligands. In this work, we first validate the performance of our latest induced fit docking technology, IFD-MD, on a retrospective set of public experimental GPCR structures with 95% of cross-docks producing a pose with a ligand RMSD \u2264 2.5 \u00c5 in the top two predictions. We then apply IFD-MD and FEP on AlphaFold models of the somatostatin receptor family of GPCRs. We use AlphaFold models produced prior to the availability of any experimental structure from this family.

Contrary to empirical scoring functions, absolute protein-ligand binding free-energy perturbation (ABFEP) provides a theoretically more rigorous and accurate description of protein-ligand binding thermodynamics and could, in principle, greatly improve the hit rates in virtual screening. In this work, we describe an implementation of an accurate and reliable ABFEP method in FEP+. We validated the ABFEP method on eight congeneric compound series binding to eight protein receptors including both neutral and charged ligands. For ligands with net charges, the alchemical ion approach is adopted to avoid artifacts in electrostatic potential energy calculations. The calculated binding free energies correlate with experimental results with a weighted average of R2 = 0.55 for the entire dataset. We also observe an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1 kcal/mol after shifting the zero-point of the simulation data to match the average experimental values. Through ABFEP calculations using apo versus holo protein structures, we demonstrated that the protein conformational and protonation state changes between the apo and holo proteins are the main physical factors contributing to the protein reorganization free energy manifested by the overestimation of raw ABFEP calculated binding free energies using the holo structures of the proteins. Furthermore, we performed ABFEP calculations in three virtual screening applications for hit enrichment. ABFEP greatly improves the hit rates as compared to docking scores or other methods like metadynamics. The good performance of ABFEP in rank ordering compounds demonstrated in this work confirms it as a useful tool to improve the hit rates in virtual screening, thus facilitating hit discovery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Ligands", "Protein Binding", "Entropy", "Proteins", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven V", "Last Name": "Jerome", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 10201 Wateridge Circle, Suite 220, San Diego, California 92121, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mayako", "Last Name": "Michino", "Affiliation": "Tri-Institutional Therapeutics Discovery Institute, 413 E. 69th Street, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eelke B", "Last Name": "Lenselink", "Affiliation": "Galapagos NV, Generaal De Wittelaan L11 A3, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Huggins", "Affiliation": "Tri-Institutional Therapeutics Discovery Institute, 413 E. 69th Street, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Beautrait", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeremie", "Last Name": "Vendome", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lingle", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 1540 Broadway, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10036, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "PubDate": "2023May22"}, {"PMID": "37061483", "Title": "On the potentially transformative role of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo in quantum chemistry: A highly accurate method for transition metals and beyond.", "Abstract": "Approximate solutions to the ab initio electronic structure problem have been a focus of theoretical and computational chemistry research for much of the past century, with the goal of predicting relevant energy differences to within \"chemical accuracy\" (1 kcal/mol). For small organic molecules, or in general, for weakly correlated main group chemistry, a hierarchy of single-reference wave function methods has been rigorously established, spanning perturbation theory and the coupled cluster (CC) formalism. For these systems, CC with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples is known to achieve chemical accuracy, albeit at O(N7) computational cost. In addition, a hierarchy of density functional approximations of increasing formal sophistication, known as Jacob's ladder, has been shown to systematically reduce average errors over large datasets representing weakly correlated chemistry. However, the accuracy of such computational models is less clear in the increasingly important frontiers of chemical space including transition metals and f-block compounds, in which strong correlation can play an important role in reactivity. A stochastic method, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), has been shown to be capable of producing chemically accurate predictions even for challenging molecular systems beyond the main group, with relatively low O(N3 - N4) cost and near-perfect parallel efficiency. Herein, we present our perspectives on the past, present, and future of the ph-AFQMC method. We focus on its potential in transition metal quantum chemistry to be a highly accurate, systematically improvable method that can reliably probe strongly correlated systems in biology and chemical catalysis and provide reference thermochemical values (for future development of density functionals or interatomic potentials) when experiments are either noisy or absent.

Prediction of shifts, and therefore interpretation of shifts, particularly for the frequently measured amidic 15 N sites, remains a tall challenge. We demonstrate that protein 15 N chemical shift prediction from QM/MM predictions can be improved if conformational variation is included via MD sampling, focusing on the antibiotic target, E. coli Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Variations of up to 25 ppm in predicted 15 N chemical shifts are observed over the trajectory. For solution shifts the average of fluctuations on the low picosecond timescale results in a superior prediction to a single optimal conformation. For low temperature solid state measurements, the histogram of predicted shifts for locally minimized snapshots with specific solvent arrangements sampled from the trajectory explains the heterogeneous linewidths; in other words, the conformations and associated solvent are 'frozen out' at low temperatures and result in inhomogeneously broadened NMR peaks. We identified conformational degrees of freedom that contribute to chemical shift variation. Backbone torsion angles show high amplitude fluctuations during the trajectory on the low picosecond timescale. For a number of residues, including I60, \u03c8 varies by up to 60\u00ba within a conformational basin during the MD simulations, despite the fact that I60 (and other sites studied) are in a secondary structure element and remain well folded during the trajectory. Fluctuations in \u03c8 appear to be compensated by other degrees of freedom in the protein, including \u03c6 of the succeeding residue, resulting in \"rocking\" of the amide plane with changes in hydrogen bonding interactions.

Focusing on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion, the S0 to T1 energy gap, known as the triplet energy, is difficult to measure experimentally for most molecules of interest. Ab initio predictions can provide a useful alternative, however low-scaling electronic structure methods such as the Kohn-Sham and time-dependent variants of Density Functional Theory (DFT) rely heavily on the fraction of exact exchange chosen for a given functional, and tend to be unreliable when strong electronic correlation is present. Here, we use auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), a scalable electronic structure method capable of accurately describing even strongly correlated molecules, to predict the triplet energies for a series of candidate annihilators for TTA upconversion, including 9,10 substituted anthracenes and substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) and benzoselenodiazole (BSeD) compounds. We compare our results to predictions from a number of commonly used DFT functionals, as well as DLPNO-CCSD(T0), a localized approximation to coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. Together with S1 estimates from absorption/emission spectra, which are well-reproduced by TD-DFT calculations employing the range-corrected hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP, we provide predictions regarding the thermodynamic feasibility of upconversion by requiring (a) the measured T1 of the sensitizer exceeds that of the calculated T1 of the candidate annihilator, and (b) twice the T1 of the annihilator exceeds its S1 energetic value. We demonstrate a successful example of in silico discovery of a novel annihilator, phenyl-substituted BTD, and present experimental validation via low temperature phosphorescence and the presence of upconverted blue light emission when coupled to a platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) sensitizer. The BTD framework thus represents a new class of annihilators for TTA upconversion. Its chemical functionalization, guided by the computational tools utilized herein, provides a promising route towards high energy (violet to near-UV) emission.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John L", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Churchill", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "Steffen", "Last Name": "Jockusch", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "Evan J", "Last Name": "Arthur", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger Inc 120 West 45th Street New York NY 1003 USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew B", "Last Name": "Pun", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "Shiwei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute 162 5th Avenue New York NY 10010 USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "Luis M", "Last Name": "Campos", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Reichman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Shee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University 3000 Broadway New York NY 10027 USA jshee@berkeley.edu."}], "Journal": "Chemical science", "PubDate": "2020Nov17"}, {"PMID": "34096718", "Title": "OPLS4: Improving Force Field Accuracy on Challenging Regimes of Chemical Space.", "Abstract": "We report on the development and validation of the OPLS4 force field.

Our coupled cluster and auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo calculations predict multiple stable isoprene-ozone van der Waals complexes for trans-isoprene in the gas phase with moderate association energies. These results indicate that long-range dynamics in the isoprene-ozone entrance channel can impact the overall reaction in the troposphere and provide the spectroscopic information necessary to extend the microwave characterization of isoprene ozonolysis to prereactive complexes. At the air-water interface, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cycloaddition reaction between ozone and trans-isoprene follows a stepwise mechanism, which is quite distinct from our proposed gas-phase mechanism and occurs on a femtosecond time scale. The stepwise nature of isoprene ozonolysis on the aqueous surface is more consistent with the DeMore mechanism than with the Criegee mechanism suggested by the gas-phase calculations, suggesting that the reaction media may play an important role in the reaction.

Progress has been hindered by a scarcity of high-quality gas-phase experimental data, while exact ab initio predictions are usually computationally unaffordable because of the large size of the relevant complexes. In this work, we present a data set of 34 tetrahedral, square planar, and octahedral 3d metal-containing complexes with gas-phase ligand-dissociation energies that have reported uncertainties of \u22642 kcal/mol. We perform all-electron phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) calculations utilizing multideterminant trial wave functions selected by a black box procedure. We compare the results with those from the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP, B97, M06, PBE0, \u03c9B97X-V, and DSD-PBEP86/2013 functionals and a localized orbital variant of the coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (DLPNO-CCSD(T)).

The reasonable performance of a number of DFT functionals is in stark contrast to the much poorer accuracy previously demonstrated for diatomic species, suggesting a moderation in electron correlation because of ligand coordination in most cases.

The only essential inputs required from the user are the structures of the separated reactants and products. The seamless workflow combining computational technologies from the fields of cheminformatics, molecular mechanics, and quantum chemistry automatically finds the most probable correspondence between the atoms in the reactants and the products, generates a transition state guess, launches a transition state search through a combined approach involving the relaxing string method and the quadratic synchronous transit, and finally validates the transition state via the analysis of the reactive chemical bonds and imaginary vibrational frequencies as well as by the intrinsic reaction coordinate method.

Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies is therefore of central importance in computational chemistry and computer aided drug design. Multiple recent improvements in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling methods, and simulation setup have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein-ligands binding free energies, and position free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small molecule drug discovery. In this Account, we outline the relevant methodological advances, including the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Temperting) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with convential FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, the OPLS3 force field, and the advanced simulation setup that constitute our FEP+ approach, followed by the presentation of extensive comparisons with experiment, demonstrating sufficient accuracy in potency prediction (better than 1 kcal/mol) to substantially impact lead optimization campaigns. The limitations of the current FEP+ implementation and best practices in drug discovery applications are also discussed followed by the future methodology development plans to address those limitations. We then report results from a recent drug discovery project, in which several thousand FEP+ calculations were successfully deployed to simultaneously optimize potency, selectivity, and solubility, illustrating the power of the approach to solve challenging drug design problems. The capabilities of free energy calculations to accurately predict potency and selectivity have led to the advance of ongoing drug discovery projects, in challenging situations where alternative approaches would have great difficulties. The ability to effectively carry out projects evaluating tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of proposed drug candidates, is potentially transformative in enabling hard to drug targets to be attacked, and in facilitating the development of superior compounds, in various dimensions, for a wide range of targets. More effective integration of FEP+ calculations into the drug discovery process will ensure that the results are deployed in an optimal fashion for yielding the best possible compounds entering the clinic; this is where the greatest payoff is in the exploitation of computer driven design capabilities. A key conclusion from the work described is the surprisingly robust and accurate results that are attainable within the conventional classical simulation, fixed charge paradigm. No doubt there are individual cases that would benefit from a more sophisticated energy model or dynamical treatment, and properties other than protein-ligand binding energies may be more sensitive to these approximations.

The computational cost of performing these calculations has to date been relatively high, impeding many important applications of these approaches. Here we present a correlated sampling methodology for AFQMC which relies on error cancellation to dramatically accelerate the calculation of energy differences of relevance to chemical transformations. In particular, we show that our correlated sampling-based AFQMC approach is capable of calculating redox properties, deprotonation free energies, and hydrogen abstraction energies in an efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy. We validate the computational protocol by calculating the ionization potentials and electron affinities of the atoms contained in the G2 test set and then proceed to utilize a composite method, which treats fixed-geometry processes with correlated sampling-based AFQMC and relaxation energies via MP2, to compute the ionization potential, deprotonation free energy, and the O-H bond disocciation energy of methanol, all to within chemical accuracy. We show that the efficiency of correlated sampling relative to uncorrelated calculations increases with system and basis set size and that correlated sampling greatly reduces the required number of random walkers to achieve a target statistical error.

Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein-ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is critical not only in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein-ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Drug Discovery", "Ligands", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Proteins", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lingle", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuqing", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Byungchan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "David N", "Last Name": "LeBard", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Wandschneider", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mike", "Last Name": "Beachy", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University , 3000 Broadway, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical theory and computation", "PubDate": "2017Jan10"}, {"PMID": "27908641", "Title": "Free Energy Perturbation Calculation of Relative Binding Free Energy between Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies and the gp120 Glycoprotein of HIV-1.", "Abstract": "Direct calculation of relative binding affinities between antibodies and antigens is a long-sought goal.

Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2=0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction.

The greatest challenges in docking occur when the receptor significantly reorganizes upon small molecule binding, thereby requiring an induced fit docking (IFD) approach in which the receptor is allowed to move in order to bind to the ligand optimally. IFD methods have had some success but suffer from a lack of reliability. Complementing IFD with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is a straightforward solution in principle but not in practice due to the severe time scale limitations of MD. Here we introduce a metadynamics plus IFD strategy for accurate and reliable prediction of the structures of protein-ligand complexes at a practically useful computational cost. Our strategy allows treating this problem in full atomistic detail and in a computationally efficient manner and enhances the predictive power of IFD methods. We significantly increase the accuracy of the underlying IFD protocol across a large data set comprising 42 different ligand-receptor systems.

WScore also contains a detailed model for localized ligand and protein strain energy and integrates an MM-GBSA scoring component with these terms to assess delocalized strain of the complex. Ensemble docking is used to take into account induced fit effects on the receptor conformation, and protein reorganization free energies are assigned via fitting to experimental data.

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005).

The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein-ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Ligands", "Models, Molecular", "Peptides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Proteins", "Quantum Theory", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Harder", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wolfgang", "Last Name": "Damm", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jon", "Last Name": "Maple", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chuanjie", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Reboul", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jin Yu", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lingle", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dmitry", "Last Name": "Lupyan", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Markus K", "Last Name": "Dahlgren", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Knight", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph W", "Last Name": "Kaus", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Krilov", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "William L", "Last Name": "Jorgensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University , New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger, Inc., 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University , 3000 Broadway, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical theory and computation", "PubDate": "2016Jan12"}, {"PMID": "26457994", "Title": "Accurate Binding Free Energy Predictions in Fragment Optimization.", "Abstract": "Predicting protein-ligand binding free energies is a central aim of computational structure-based drug design (SBDD)--improved accuracy in binding free energy predictions could significantly reduce costs and accelerate project timelines in lead discovery and optimization.

Accurately predicting the relative binding free energy changes of modifications to ligands is especially valuable in the field of fragment-based drug design, since fragment screens tend to deliver initial hits of low binding affinity that require multiple rounds of synthesis to gain the requisite potency for a project. In this study, we show that a free energy perturbation protocol, FEP+, which was previously validated on drug-like lead compounds, is suitable for the calculation of relative binding strengths of fragment-sized compounds as well. We study several pharmaceutically relevant targets with a total of more than 90 fragments and find that the FEP+ methodology, which uses explicit solvent molecular dynamics and physics-based scoring with no parameters adjusted, can accurately predict relative fragment binding affinities.

From the QM/MM calculation, a barrier height of 17.5 kcal/mol was obtained, while the experimental value was known to be less than or equal to 10 kcal/mol. This process was repeated using the D3 correction for hybrid DFT in order to investigate whether the inadequate treatment of dispersion interaction was responsible for the overestimation of the barrier. While the D3 correction does reduce the computed barrier to 13.3 kcal/mol, it was still in disagreement with experiment. After application of a series of transition metal optimized localized orbital corrections (DBLOC) and without any refitting of parameters, the barrier was further reduced to 10.0 kcal/mol, which was consistent with the experimental results. The DBLOC method to C\uf8ffH bond activation in methane monooxygenase (MMO) was also applied, as a second, independent test. The barrier in MMO was known, by experiment, to be 15.4 kcal/mol.

In addition, these methods can be ambiguous in their determination of state S for particular materials and, for a given material, the spectral methods can be ambiguous when using particular peaks. Using first-principles Raman theory, we have discovered a simple, non-resonance, polarized Raman method for determining the state S that requires no information a priori and will work unambiguously for any material using any vibrational mode. Similar to the concept behind \"magic angle spinning\" in NMR, we have found that for a special set of incident/analyzed polarizations and scattering angle, the dependence of the Raman modulation depth M on the sample composition-and, for crystalline regions, the unit cell orientation-falls out completely, leaving dependence on only whether the region is crystalline (M = 1) or isotropic (M = 0). Further, upon scanning between homogeneous regions or domains within a heterogeneous sample, our signal M is a clear detector of the region boundaries, so that when combined with methods for determining the orientations of the crystalline domains, our method can be used to completely characterize the molecular structure of an entire heterogeneous sample to a very high certainty. Interestingly, our method can also be used to determine when a given mode is vibrationally degenerate. While simulations on realistic terthiophene systems are included to illustrate our findings, our method should apply to any type of material, including thin films, molecular crystals, and semiconductors.

The combination of a single scale factor with the DBLOC (localized orbital corrections for first row transition metals) corrections (and thus a single adjustable parameter in all) improves the mean unsigned error from 5.7 pKa units (with no parameters) to 0.9 pKa units (maximum error 2.2 pKa units), which is close to chemical accuracy for this type of system. These results provide further encouragement with regard to the ability of the B3LYP-DBLOC model to provide accurate and robust results for DFT calculations on transition metal containing species.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Steven V", "Last Name": "Jerome", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Thomas F", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

We have developed a novel knowledge based approach to model the CDR loops, using a combination of sequence similarity, geometry matching, and the clustering of database structures. The homology models are further optimized with a physics-based energy function (VSGB2.0), which improves the model quality significantly. H3 loop modeling remains the most challenging task. Our ab initio loop prediction performs well for the H3 loop in the crystal structure context, and allows improved results when refining the H3 loops in the context of homology models. For the 10 human and mouse derived antibodies in this assessment, the average RMSDs for the homology model Fv and framework regions are 1.19 \u00c5 and 0.74 \u00c5, respectively. The average RMSDs for five non-H3 CDR loops range from 0.61 \u00c5 to 1.05 \u00c5, and the H3 loop average RMSD is 2.91 \u00c5 using our knowledge-based loop prediction approach. The ab initio H3 loop predictions yield an average RMSD of 1.28 \u00c5 when performed in the context of the crystal structure and 2.67 \u00c5 in the context of the homology modeled structure.

Our calculations indicate that protons react with TiO2 to form covalent O-H bonds. This is in contrast to the reaction of Li(+) with TiO2, in which case the alkali metal is more accurately described as a simple coordinating cation. The covalent O-H bonding leads both to deeper electron trap states and to significantly higher barriers for the diffusion of carriers.

In particular, back-calculated chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of the populations of residual secondary structure elements and helix capping interactions, while spin-relaxation calculations are sensitive to a combination of dynamic and structural factors. Back calculated chemical shift and spin-relaxation data can be used to evaluate the populations of specific interactions in disordered states and identify regions of the phase space that are inconsistent with experimental measurements. The structural interactions that favor and disfavor helical conformations in the disordered basic region of the GCN4 bZip domain were analyzed in order to assess the implications of the structure and dynamics of the apo form for the DNA binding mechanism.

Further, as loop prediction advances to success with larger loops, the exclusion of loops containing secondary structure becomes awkward. Here, we extend the applicability of the Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP) to loops up to 17 residues in length that contain either helical or hairpin segments. In general, PLOP hierarchically samples conformational space and ranks candidate loops with a high-quality molecular mechanics force field. For loops identified to possess \u03b1-helical segments, we employ an alternative dihedral library composed of (\u03d5,\u03c8) angles commonly found in helices. The alternative library is searched over a user-specified range of residues that define the helical bounds. The source of these helical bounds can be from popular secondary structure prediction software or from analysis of past loop predictions where a propensity to form a helix is observed. Due to the maturity of our energy model, the lowest energy loop across all experiments can be selected with an accuracy of sub-\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m RMSD in 80% of cases, 1.0 to 1.5 \u00c5 RMSD in 14% of cases, and poorer than 1.5 \u00c5 RMSD in 6% of cases. The effectiveness of our current methods in predicting hairpin-containing loops is explored with hairpins up to 13 residues in length and again reaching an accuracy of sub-\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m RMSD in 83% of cases, 1.0 to 1.5 \u00c5 RMSD in 10% of cases, and poorer than 1.5 \u00c5 RMSD in 7% of cases. Finally, we explore the effect of an imprecise surrounding environment, in which side chains, but not the backbone, are initially in perturbed geometries. In these cases, loops perturbed to 3\u00c5 RMSD from the native environment were restored to their native conformation with sub-\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m RMSD.", "Keywords": ["all-atom force field", "conformational sampling", "hairpin prediction", "helix prediction", "homology modeling", "loop prediction", "loop refinement", "secondary structure prediction"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward B", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Colleen S", "Last Name": "Murrett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suwen", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dahlia A", "Last Name": "Goldfeld", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Bylund", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical theory and computation", "PubDate": "2013Mar12"}, {"PMID": "23688933", "Title": "Computational methods for high resolution prediction and refinement of protein structures.", "Abstract": "We review advances in implicit solvation and sampling algorithms which have resulted in enhanced capabilities in predicting and refining localized protein structures (e.g. loop regions) to high resolution.

Choices for many parameters of the simulations, such as buffer volume, water model, or salt concentration, have only minor influences on the resulting order parameters. In contrast, seemingly minor conformational differences in starting structures, such as orientations of sidechain hydroxyl groups, resulting from applying different protonation algorithms to the same structure, have major effects on backbone dynamics. Some, but not all, of these effects are mitigated by increased sampling in simulations. Most discrepancies between simulated and experimental results occur for residues located at the ends of secondary structures and involve large amplitude nanosecond timescale transitions between distinct conformational substates. These transitions result in autocorrelation functions for bond vector reorientation that do not converge when calculated over individual simulation blocks, typically of length similar to the overall rotational diffusion time. A test for convergence before averaging the order parameters from different blocks results in better agreement between order parameters calculated from different sets of simulations and with NMR-derived order parameters. Thus, MD-derived order parameters are more strongly affected by transitions between conformational substates than by fluctuations within individual substates themselves, while conformational differences in the starting structures affect the frequency and scale of such transitions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Computational Biology", "Glycine", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Reproducibility of Results", "Streptococcus", "Time Factors", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Zeiske", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kate A", "Last Name": "Stafford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arthur G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proteins", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "22965891", "Title": "Loop prediction for a GPCR homology model: algorithms and results.", "Abstract": "We present loop structure prediction results of the intracellular and extracellular loops of four G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): bovine rhodopsin (bRh), the turkey \u03b21-adrenergic (\u03b21Ar), the human \u03b22-adrenergic (\u03b22Ar) and the human A2a adenosine receptor (A2Ar) in perturbed environments.
