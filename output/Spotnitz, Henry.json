Far-UVC technology is an emerging disinfection method that directly kills microorganisms using light. In contrast with conventional UV sterilization, far-UVC light has antimicrobial capabilities without apparent harm to mammalian cells. This study examines the application of 224 nm far-UVC light delivered from a laser using an optical diffuser towards the goal of protecting against bacterial invasion around skin penetrating devices. Delivery of far-UVC using a laser and optical fibers enables exposure to unique geometries that would otherwise be shielded when using a lamp. Testing of the bactericidal potential of diffusing the far-UVC laser output over a large area was tested and yielded qualitative area killing results. The killing of MRSA using this method was also examined using an in vitro survival assay. Results followed a classic log-linear disinfection model with a rate constant of k = 0.51 cm2/mJ, which corresponds to an inactivation cross section of D90 = 4.5 mJ/cm2.

The authors hypothesized that resynchronization with optimized temporary multisite pacing postoperatively would be safe, feasible, and effective. Pacing was assessed in the intensive care unit within the first 24 h after surgery. Two unipolar atrial pacing leads and four bipolar ventricular pacing leads were placed at standardized sites intraoperatively. Pacing was optimized to maximize mean arterial pressure. The protocol tested 11 combinations of the 4 different ventricular lead sites, 6 atrioventricular delays (50-150 ms), and 14 intraventricular delays. Optimal pacing settings were thus determined and ultimately compared in four configurations: bipolar, unipolar, single-site atrioventricular pacing, and intrinsic rhythm. Each patient was his or her own control, and all pacing comparisons were implemented in random sequence. Single-ventricle palliation was performed for 17 children ages 0-21 years. Pacing increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) versus intrinsic rhythm, with the following configurations: bipolar multisite pacing increased MAP by 2.2 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.2 \u00b1 2.4 mmHg; p = 0.013) and unipolar multisite pacing increased MAP by 2.8 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg; p = 0.002). Atrioventricular single-site pacing increased MAP by 2.1 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.1 \u00b1 2.5 mmHg: p = 0.02, insignificant difference under Bonferroni correction). The echocardiographic fractional area change in nine patients increased significantly only with unipolar pacing (32 \u00b1 3.1 to 36 \u00b1 4.2 %; p = 0.02). No study-related adverse events occurred.

This system is neutral to the measurement technology used, but focuses on little-discussed quantitative physiological requirements. We then present a rational roadmap for reliable cost-effective development and evaluation of schemes. A widely recommended approach for AV optimisation is to visually select the ideal pattern of transmitral Doppler flow. Alternatively, one could measure a variable (such as Doppler velocity time integral) and \"pick the highest\". More complex would be to make measurements across a range of settings and \"fit a curve\". In this report we provide clinicians with a critical approach to address any recommendations presented to them, as they may be many, indistinct and conflicting. We present a neutral scientific analysis of each scheme, and equip the reader with simple tools for critical evaluation. Optimisation protocols should deliver: (a) singularity, with only one region of optimality rather than several; (b) blinded test-retest reproducibility; (c) plausibility; (d) concordance between independent methods; and (e) transparency, with all steps open to scrutiny. This simple information is still not available for many optimisation schemes. Clinicians developing the habit of asking about each property in turn will find it easier to win now down the broad range of protocols currently promoted.
