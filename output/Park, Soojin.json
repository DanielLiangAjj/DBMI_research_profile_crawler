However, identifying its harmful thresholds and controlling ICP remain challenging in terms of improving outcomes. Evidence suggests that an individualized approach is necessary for establishing tolerance limits for ICP, incorporating factors such as ICP waveform (ICPW) or pulse morphology along with additional data provided by other invasive (e.g., brain oximetry) and noninvasive monitoring (NIM) methods (e.g., transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter ultrasound, and pupillometry). This study aims to assess current ICP monitoring practices among experienced clinicians and explore whether guidelines should incorporate ancillary parameters from NIM and ICPW in future updates.", "Keywords": ["Cerebral perfusion pressure", "Individualized care", "Intracranial compliance", "Intracranial pressure", "Intracranial pressure waveform", "Neurocritical care"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "S\u00e9rgio", "Last Name": "Brasil", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, School of Medicine University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Av.

An update for the intensivist.", "Abstract": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a rare yet profoundly debilitating condition associated with high global case fatality and morbidity rates. The key determinants of functional outcome include early brain injury, rebleeding of the ruptured aneurysm and delayed cerebral ischaemia. The only effective way to reduce the risk of rebleeding is to secure the ruptured aneurysm quickly. Prompt diagnosis, transfer to specialized centers, and meticulous management in the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly improved the prognosis of aSAH. Recently, multimodality monitoring with specific interventions to correct pathophysiological imbalances has been proposed. Vigilance extends beyond intracranial concerns to encompass systemic respiratory and haemodynamic monitoring, as derangements in these systems can precipitate secondary brain damage. Challenges persist in treating aSAH patients, exacerbated by a paucity of robust clinical evidence, with many interventions showing no benefit when tested in rigorous clinical trials. Given the growing body of literature in this field and the issuance of contemporary guidelines, our objective is to furnish an updated review of essential principles of ICU management for this patient population. Our review will discuss the epidemiology, initial stabilization, treatment strategies, long-term prognostic factors, the identification and management of post-aSAH complications.

We now experience a unique situation of having indices clinically available before definitive evidence of benefit or practice guidelines, in a moment when high rates of institutional variability exist both in the application of monitoring as well as in monitoring-guided treatments. Responses from 47 international clinicians, experts in this field, were collected with polling and discussion of the results. The clinical use of CCA in critical illness was not universal among experts, with 34% not using it. Of those who use a CCA index in clinical practice, 64% use intracranial pressure-based Pressure Reactivity index\u00a0(PRx). There seems to exist a considerable trust in the physiologic plausibility of CCA to guide individual arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure therapy and provide benefit, regardless of the difficulty of proving this. A total of 59% feel the need for phase II and III prospective studies but would continue to use CCA information in their practice even if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show clear clinical benefit. There was nearly universal interest to participate in an RCT, with agreement that the research community must together determine end points and interventions to reduce wasted effort and time, and that investigations should include the following: the most appropriate way of inclusion of CCA into the clinical workflow; whether CCA-guided interventions should be prophylactic, proactive; or reactive; and whether a CCA-centric (unimodal) or a multimodal monitoring-integrated tiered therapy approach should be adopted. Pediatric and neonatal populations were highlighted as having urgent need and even more plausibility than adults. On the whole, the initiative was enthusiastically embraced by the experts, with the general feeling that a strong push should be now made by the community to convert the plausible benefits of CCA monitoring, already implemented in some centers, into a more standardized and RCT-validated clinical reality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Homeostasis", "Critical Care", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Intracranial Pressure", "Neurophysiological Monitoring", "Anesthesia", "Monitoring, Physiologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erta", "Last Name": "Beqiri", "Affiliation": "Brain Physics Laboratory, Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Smielewski", "Affiliation": "Brain Physics Laboratory, Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. ps10011@cam.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Marcel", "Last Name": "Aries", "Affiliation": "School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, University Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "CLINICCA (CLINical use of Information on Continuous monitoring of Cerebral Autoregulation)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurocritical care", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "37704934", "Title": "Common Data Elements for Disorders of Consciousness: Recommendations from the Working Group on Physiology and Big Data.", "Abstract": "The implementation of multimodality monitoring in the clinical management of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) results in physiological measurements that can be collected in a continuous and regular fashion or even at waveform resolution.

CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown. By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively. Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients [ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006], but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz [odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9] and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection. These data may allow screening for CMD based on widely available structural MRI and resting EEG.", "Keywords": ["MRI", "cognitive motor dissociation", "electroencephalography", "imaging", "structural injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain Injuries", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prosencephalon", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Consciousness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Franzova", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Doyle", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justine M", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Egbebike", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Athina", "Last Name": "Vrosgou", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerina C", "Last Name": "Carmona", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Grobois", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Heinonen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Velazquez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ian Jerome", "Last Name": "Gonzales", "Affiliation": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Egawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2023Nov02"}, {"PMID": "37546936", "Title": "ABO Blood Type and Thromboembolic Complications after Intracerebral Hemorrhage: an exploratory analysis.", "Abstract": "Non-O blood types are known to be associated with thromboembolic complications (TECs) in population-based studies.

The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for automatically identifying segments of intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform data from external ventricular drainage (EVD) recordings during intermittent drainage and closure.Methods. The proposed method uses time-frequency analysis through wavelets to distinguish periods of ICP waveform in EVD data. By comparing the frequency compositions of the ICP signals (when the EVD system is clamped) and the artifacts (when the system is open), the algorithm can detect short, uninterrupted segments of ICP waveform from the longer periods of non-measurement data. The method involves applying a wavelet transform, calculating the absolute power in a specific range, using Otsu thresholding to automatically identify a threshold, and performing a morphological operation to remove small segments. Two investigators manually graded the same randomly selected one-hour segments of the resulting processed data. Performance metrics were calculated as a percentage.Results. The study analyzed data from 229 patients who had EVD placed following subarachnoid hemorrhage between June 2006 and December 2012. Of these, 155 (67.7%) were female and 62 (27%) developed delayed cerebral ischemia. A total of 45 150 h of data were segmented. 2044 one-hour segments were randomly selected and evaluated by two investigators (MM and DN). Of those, the evaluators agreed on the classification of 1556 one-hour segments. The algorithm was able to correctly identify 86% (1338 h) of ICP waveform data. 8.2% (128 h) of the time the algorithm either partially or fully failed to segment the ICP waveform. 5.4% (84 h) of data, artifacts were mistakenly identified as ICP waveforms (false positives).Conclusion. The proposed algorithm automates the identification of valid ICP waveform segments of waveform in EVD data and thus enables the inclusion in real-time data analysis for decision support.

We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]).

However, literature and guidelines have focused on unimodal signals in a specific form of acute brain injury. Integrating unimodal signals in multiple signal monitoring is the next step for clinical studies and patient care. As such, we aimed to investigate the recent application of MMM in studies of adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and hypoxic ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest (HIBI). We identified continuous or daily updated monitoring modalities and summarized the monitoring setting, study setting, and clinical characteristics. In addition, we discussed clinical outcome in intervention studies. We identified 112 MMM studies, including 11 modalities, over the last 7\u00a0years (2015-2022). Fifty-eight studies (52%) applied only two modalities. Most frequently combined were ICP monitoring (92 studies (82%)) together with PbtO2 (63 studies (56%). Most studies included patients with TBI (59 studies) or SAH (53 studies). The enrollment period of 34 studies (30%) took more than 5\u00a0years, whereas the median sample size was only 36 patients (q1- q3, 20-74). We classified studies as either observational (68 studies) or interventional (44 studies). The interventions were subclassified as systemic (24 studies), cerebral (10 studies), and interventions guided by MMM (11 studies). We identified 20 different systemic or cerebral interventions. Nine (9/11, 82%) of the MMM-guided studies included clinical outcome as an endpoint. In 78% (7/9) of these MMM-guided intervention studies, a significant improvement in outcome was demonstrated in favor of interventions guided by MMM. Clinical outcome may be improved with interventions guided by MMM. This strengthens the belief in this application, but further interdisciplinary collaborations are needed to overcome the heterogeneity, as illustrated in the present review. Future research should focus on increasing sample sizes, improved data collection, refining definitions of secondary injuries, and standardized interventions.

Incidence has decreased over past decades, possibly in part related to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and management of hypertension. Approximately a quarter of patients with SAH die before hospital admission; overall outcomes are improved in those admitted to hospital, but with elevated risk of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae such as depression. The disease continues to have a major public health impact as the mean age of onset is in the mid-fifties, leading to many years of reduced quality of life. The clinical presentation varies, but severe, sudden onset of headache is the most common symptom, variably associated with meningismus, transient or prolonged unconsciousness, and focal neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies and paresis. Diagnosis is made by CT scan of the head possibly followed by lumbar puncture. Aneurysms are commonly the underlying vascular cause of spontaneous SAH and are diagnosed by angiography. Emergent therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing the risk of rebleeding (ie, preventing hypertension and correcting coagulopathies) and, most crucially, early aneurysm treatment using coil embolisation or clipping. Management of the disease is best delivered in specialised intensive care units and high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team. Increasingly, early brain injury presenting as global cerebral oedema is recognised as a potential treatment target but, currently, disease management is largely focused on addressing secondary complications such as hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischaemia related to microvascular dysfunction and large vessel vasospasm, and medical complications such as stunned myocardium and hospital acquired infections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Intracranial Aneurysm", "Quality of Life", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.

While risk factors for COVID-19 have been described, COVID-19 endotypes have not been elucidated. Objectives: We sought to identify and describe COVID-19 endotypes of hospitalized patients. Methods: Consensus clustering (using the ensemble method) of patient age and laboratory values during admission identified endotypes. We analyzed data from 528 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to telemetry capable beds at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and discharged between March 12 to July 15, 2020. Results: Four unique endotypes were identified and described by laboratory values, demographics, outcomes, and treatments. Endotypes 1 and 2 were comprised of low numbers of intubated patients (1 and 6%) and exhibited low mortality (1 and 6%), whereas endotypes 3 and 4 included high numbers of intubated patients (72 and 85%) with elevated mortality (21 and 43%). Endotypes 2 and 4 had the most comorbidities. Endotype 1 patients had low levels of inflammatory markers (ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH), low infectious markers (WBC, procalcitonin), and low degree of coagulopathy (PTT, PT), while endotype 4 had higher levels of those markers. Conclusions: Four unique endotypes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified, which segregated patients based on inflammatory markers, infectious markers, evidence of end-organ dysfunction, comorbidities, and outcomes. High comorbidities did not associate with poor outcome endotypes. Further work is needed to validate these endotypes in other cohorts and to study endotype differences to treatment responses.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "cluster analysis", "endotype", "machine

"COVID-19 presentations range from mild to moderate through severe disease but also manifest with persistent illness or viral recrudescence. We hypothesized that the spectrum of COVID-19 disease manifestations was a consequence of SARS-CoV-2-mediated delay in the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) response, including dampened type I interferon signaling, thereby shifting the balance of the immune response to be dominated by damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling. To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease trajectories termed \"patient archetypes\", whose temporal dynamics are reflected in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The model also accounts for responses to corticosteroid therapy and predicts that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular memory will be protective, including from severe COVID-19 disease.

Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise.

Recent reports suggest that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity may be altered during changes in ICP. Our study aimed to assess ANS activity during RIH and the causal relationship between rising in ICP and autonomic activity. We reviewed retrospectively 24 multicenter (Cambridge, Tromso, Berlin) patients in whom RIH developed as a pre-terminal event after acute brain injury (ABI). They were monitored with ICP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and electrocardiography (ECG) using ICM+ software. Parameters reflecting autonomic activity were computed in time and frequency domain through the measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Our results demonstrated that a rise in ICP was associated to a significant rise in HRV and BRS with a higher significance level in the high-frequency HRV (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This increase was followed by a significant decrease in HRV and BRS above the upper-breakpoint of ICP where ICP pulse-amplitude starts to decrease whereas the mean ICP continues to rise. Temporality measured with a Granger test suggests a causal relationship from ICP to ANS. The above results suggest that a rise in ICP interacts with ANS activity, mainly interfacing with the parasympathetic-system. The ANS seems to react to the rise in ICP with a response possibly focused on maintaining the cerebrovascular homeostasis. This happens until the critical threshold of ICP is reached above which the ANS variables collapse, probably because of low perfusion of the brain and the central autonomic network.", "Keywords": ["Granger causality", "autonomic nervous system", "refractory intracranial hypertension", "upper breakpoint of ICP"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Baroreflex", "Brain Injuries", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Intracranial Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Fedriga", "Affiliation": "Brain Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Physics Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andras", "Last Name": "Czigler", "Affiliation": "Brain Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Physics Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Nasr", "Affiliation": "Unit\u00e8 de Neurologie Vasculaire, CHU de Toulouse, Universit\u00e8 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."}, {"First Name": "Frederick A", "Last Name": "Zeiler", "Affiliation": "Division of Anaesthesia, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Division of Hospitalist and Critical Care Neurology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Donnelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Auckland, Aukland, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Vasilios", "Last Name": "Papaioannou", "Affiliation": "University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Intensive Care Unit, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Shirin K", "Last Name": "Frisvold", "Affiliation": "Department of Intensive Care, University Hospital of North Norway, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Charite Hospital, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Rasulo", "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Spedali Civili University Hospital, Brescia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Sykora", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, St. John's Hospital Vienna, Medical Faculty, Sigmund Freud University, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Smielewski", "Affiliation": "Brain Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Physics Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Czosnyka", "Affiliation": "Brain Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Physics Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "PubDate": "2021Jun15"}, {"PMID": "33193007", "Title": "The Association Between Peri-Hemorrhagic Metabolites and Cerebral Hemodynamics in Comatose Patients With Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: An International Multicenter Pilot Study Analysis.", "Abstract": "Background and Objective: Cerebral microdialysis (CMD) enables monitoring brain tissue metabolism and risk factors for secondary brain injury such as an imbalance of consumption, altered utilization, and delivery of oxygen and glucose, frequently present following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) with hemodynamic variables [mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebrovascular pressure reactivity (PRx)] and metabolic variables (glutamate, glucose, and glycerol), within the cerebral peri-hemorrhagic region, with the hypothesis that there may be an association between these variables, leading to a worsening of outcome in comatose SICH patients. Methods: This is an international multicenter cohort study regarding a retrospective dataset analysis of non-consecutive comatose patients with supratentorial SICH undergoing invasive multimodality neuromonitoring admitted to neurocritical care units pertaining to three different centers. Patients with SICH were included if they had an indication for invasive ICP and CMD monitoring, were >18 years of age, and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of \u22648. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the analysis. A total monitoring time of 1,558 h was analyzed, with a mean (SD) monitoring time of 70.72 h (66.25) per patient. Moreover, 21 out of the 22 patients (95%) had disturbed cerebrovascular autoregulation during the observation period. When considering a dichotomized LPR for a threshold level of 25 or 40, there was a statistically significant difference in all the measured variables (PRx, glucose, glutamate), but not glycerol. When dichotomized PRx was considered as the dependent variable, only LPR was related to autoregulation. A lower PRx was associated with a higher survival [27.9% (23.1%) vs. 56.0% (31.3%), p = 0.03]. Conclusions: According to our results, disturbed autoregulation in comatose SICH patients is common.

Gaps exist in patient assessment, outcome prognostication, and treatment directed specifically at improving consciousness and cognitive recovery. In 2019, the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS)\u00a0launched the Curing Coma Campaign in order to address the \"grand challenge\" of improving the management of patients with coma and decreased consciousness. One of the first steps was to bring together a Scientific Advisory Council including coma scientists, neurointensivists, neurorehabilitationists, and implementation experts in order to address the current scientific landscape and begin to develop a framework on how to move forward. This manuscript describes the proceedings of the first Curing Coma Campaign Scientific Advisory Council meeting which occurred in conjunction with the NCS Annual Meeting in October 2019 in Vancouver. Specifically, three major pillars were identified which should be considered: endotyping of coma and disorders of consciousness, biomarkers, and proof-of-concept clinical trials. Each is summarized with regard to current approach, benefits to the patient, family, and clinicians, and next steps. Integration of these three pillars will be essential to the success of the Curing Coma Campaign as will expanding the \"curing coma community\" to ensure broad participation of clinicians, scientists, and patient advocates with the goal of identifying and implementing treatments to fundamentally improve the outcome of patients.", "Keywords": ["Biomarker", "Coma", "Consciousness", "Endotype",

We describe a medically-refractory case of CVST in a 35-year-old woman later found to have JAK2 mutation and essential thrombocytosis. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Forty-hours of continuous-tPA in addition to systemic intravenous-heparin led to complete radiographic and clinical resolution of CVST. Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially. Our findings were speculative and hypothesis generating as to whether this explained medical treatment failure.

The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome. METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up. RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment. Further study is needed to determine the long-term functional significance of UEAV.", "Keywords": ["ACA = anterior cerebral artery", "APACHE-II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II", "CI = confidence interval", "CTA = CT angiography", "DCI = delayed cerebral ischemia", "DSA = digital subtraction angiography", "HR = hazard ratio", "ICA = internal carotid artery", "MAP = mean arterial pressure", "MCA = middle cerebral artery", "OR = odd ratio", "PCoA = posterior communicating artery", "SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage", "UEAV = ultra-early angiographic vasospasm", "cerebral infarction", "cerebral vasospasm", "delayed cerebral ischemia", "functional recovery", "mRS = modified Rankin Scale", "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "vascular disorders"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Cerebral Infarction", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Infarction", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Vasospasm, Intracranial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Shouri", "Last Name": "Lahiri", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Witsch", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Peter", "Last Name": "Frey", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Neha", "Last Name": "Dangayach", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Falo", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Stephan A", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Philip M", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center; and."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PubDate": "2017May"}, {"PMID": "27165893", "Title": "Brain Oxygen Relationship to Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Depends on Tip Location and Time Window: Can Brain O2 Be an Adjunctive Modality for Determining Optimal CPP?", "Abstract": "Controversy exists regarding the brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) monitor's optimal tip location and what it actually measures.
