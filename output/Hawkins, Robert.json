[{"PMID": "38951520", "Title": "Shared functional specialization in transformer-based language models and the human brain.", "Abstract": "When processing language, the brain is thought to deploy specialized computations to construct meaning from complex linguistic structures. Recently, artificial neural networks based on the Transformer architecture have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Transformers integrate contextual information across words via structured circuit computations. Prior work has focused on the internal representations (\"embeddings\") generated by these circuits. In this paper, we instead analyze the circuit computations directly: we deconstruct these computations into the functionally-specialized \"transformations\" that integrate contextual information across words. Using functional MRI data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic stories, we first verify that the transformations account for considerable variance in brain activity across the cortical language network. We then demonstrate that the emergent computations performed by individual, functionally-specialized \"attention heads\" differentially predict brain activity in specific cortical regions. These heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers and context lengths in a low-dimensional cortical space.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Language", "Brain", "Male", "Female", "Adult", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Brain Mapping", "Young Adult", "Models, Neurological", "Natural Language Processing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sreejan", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. sreejank@princeton.edu."}, {"First Name": "Theodore R", "Last Name": "Sumers", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. sumers@princeton.edu."}, {"First Name": "Takateru", "Last Name": "Yamakoshi", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Business School, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 9190401, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Uri", "Last Name": "Hasson", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth A", "Last Name": "Norman", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas L", "Last Name": "Griffiths", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Nastase", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. snastase@princeton.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2024Jun29"}, {"PMID": "38924663", "Title": "Single-neuron analysis of aging-associated changes in learning reveals impairments in transcriptional plasticity.", "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying age-related declines in learning and long-term memory are still not fully understood. To address this gap, our study focused on investigating the transcriptional landscape of a singularly identified motor neuron L7 in Aplysia, which is pivotal in a specific type of nonassociative learning known as sensitization of the siphon-withdraw reflex. Employing total RNAseq analysis on a single isolated L7 motor neuron after short-term or long-term sensitization (LTS) training of Aplysia at 8, 10, and 12\u2009months (representing mature, late mature, and senescent stages), we uncovered aberrant changes in transcriptional plasticity during the aging process. Our findings specifically highlight changes in the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode transcription factors, translation regulators, RNA methylation participants, and contributors to cytoskeletal rearrangements during learning and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Furthermore, our comparative gene expression analysis identified distinct transcriptional alterations in two other neurons, namely the motor neuron L11 and the giant cholinergic neuron R2, whose roles in LTS are not yet fully elucidated. Taken together, our analyses underscore cell type-specific impairments in the expression of key components related to learning and memory within the transcriptome as organisms age, shedding light on the complex molecular mechanisms driving cognitive decline during aging.", "Keywords": ["gene expression", "molecular biology of aging", "neuroscience", "senescence"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kerriann K", "Last Name": "Badal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Sadhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bindu L", "Last Name": "Raveendra", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "McCracken", "Affiliation": "The Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Lozano-Villada", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amol C", "Last Name": "Shetty", "Affiliation": "The Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Gillette", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Aplysia, University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Sciences, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yibo", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dustin", "Last Name": "Stommes", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Aplysia, University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Sciences, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynne A", "Last Name": "Fieber", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Aplysia, University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Sciences, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Schmale", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Aplysia, University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Sciences, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anup", "Last Name": "Mahurkar", "Affiliation": "The Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sathyanarayanan V", "Last Name": "Puthanveettil", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, Jupiter, Florida, USA."}], "Journal": "Aging cell", "PubDate": "2024Jun24"}, {"PMID": "38890088", "Title": "The Association of Oxygen Delivery and Transfusion on Cardiopulmonary Bypass with Acute Kidney Injury.", "Abstract": "To estimate whether the association of transfusion and acute kidney injury (AKI) has a threshold of oxygen delivery below which transfusion is beneficial but above which it is harmful.", "Keywords": ["acute kidney injury", "cardiopulmonary bypass", "oxygen delivery", "red cell transfusion"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Milo", "Last Name": "Engoren", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.

For patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), it is thought that exposure to low oxygen delivery (DO2) contributes to an increased risk of avoidable acute kidney injury. This research is motivated by estimating the threshold of nadir DO2 for CABG patients to help develop an evidence-based guideline for improving cardiac surgery practices. We review several models (sudden-jump model, broken-stick model, and the constrained broken-stick model) that can be adopted to estimate the threshold and discuss modeling assumptions, scientific plausibility, and implications in estimating the threshold. Under each model, various estimation methods are studied and compared. In particular, under a constrained broken-stick model, a modified two-step Newton-Raphson algorithm is introduced. Through comprehensive simulation studies and an application to data on CABG patients from the University of Michigan, we show that the constrained broken-stick model is flexible, more robust, and able to incorporate scientific knowledge to improve efficiency.

Inefficient costimulation in the tumor microenvironment can lead to T cell anergy and exhaustion resulting in poor anti-tumor activity. Here, we describe a chimeric costimulatory antigen receptor (CoStAR) comprised of FR\u03b1-specific scFv linked to CD28 and CD40 intracellular signaling domains. CoStAR signaling alone does not activate T cells, while the combination of TCR and CoStAR signaling enhances T cell activity resulting in less differentiated T cells, and augmentation of T cell effector functions, including cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. CoStAR activity resulted in superior T cell proliferation, even in the absence of exogenous IL-2. Using an in vivo transplantable tumor model, CoStAR was shown to improve T cell survival after transfer, enhanced control of tumor growth, and improved host survival. CoStAR could be reliably engineered into TIL from multiple tumor indications and augmented TIL activity against autologous tumor targets both in vitro and in vivo.

Jeffrey's Nursing Student Retention Student Perception Appraisal-Revised (SPA-R1) has been used extensively to understand factors that impact retention. Psychometric testing of the SPA-R1 contributes to greater confidence in the instrument's reliability and validity. Methods: Item response theory and specifically, the single parameter polytomous Rasch model was used as a framework for fit statistic testing and rating scale diagnostics of the SPA-R1. This was a secondary analysis of a convenience sample of undergraduate prelicensure nursing students. The setting for the previous study was virtual, and the study period was 2022. Results: The model item characteristic curves for the 27 items of the SPA-R1 have similar shapes and are clustered in proximity. Overall, there are three clusters of items evident in the Rasch standardized residual contrast. The Rasch scale diagnostics indicated that the scale appropriately monotonically increases. However, there is a greater than 5 logit distance between does not apply and severely restricts, between severely restricts and moderately restricts, and between does not restrict or support and moderately supports. These large threshold distances indicate that additional steps in the scale may be warranted. The items cover the mid-range of the amount of retention perceptions; however, there are no items that represent the highest magnitude of the perceived amount of influence on retention. Conclusions: This study contributes further evidence to support the validity and reliability of the SPA-R1.

We compared our social inference model against simpler heuristics in three studies of human behaviour in a collective-sensing task.

Yet models of communication have diverged along these lines, formalizing the speaker's objective in terms of either the listener's beliefs or actions. We argue that this divergence lies at the root of a longstanding controversy over the Gricean maxims of truthfulness and relevance. We first bridge the divide by introducing a speaker model which considers both the listener's beliefs (epistemic utility) and their actions (decision-theoretic utility). We show that formalizing truthfulness as an epistemic utility and relevance as a decision-theoretic utility reconciles the tension between them, readily explaining puzzles such as context-dependent standards of truthfulness. We then test a set of novel predictions generated by our model. We introduce a new signaling game which decouples utterances' truthfulness and relevance, then use it to conduct a pair of experiments. Our first experiment demonstrates that participants jointly maximize epistemic and decision-theoretic utility, rather than either alone. Our second experiment shows that when the two conflict, participants make a graded tradeoff rather than prioritizing one over the other. These results demonstrate that human communication cannot be reduced to influencing beliefs or actions alone. Taken together, our work provides a new foundation for grounding rational communication not only in what we believe, but in what those beliefs lead us to do.

In vertebrates, a detailed understanding of their functions as transmitters has been hampered by the complexity of the nervous system. The marine mollusk Aplysia, with a simpler nervous system and many large, identified neurons, presents several advantages for addressing this question and has been used to examine the roles of tens of peptides in behavior. To screen for other peptides that might also play roles in behavior, we observed immunoreactivity in individual neurons in the central nervous system of adult Aplysia with antisera raised against the Aplysia peptide FMRFamide and two mammalian peptides that are also found in Aplysia, cholecystokinin (CCK) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), as well as serotonin (5HT). In addition, we observed staining of individual neurons with antisera raised against mammalian somatostatin (SOM) and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI). However, genomic analysis has shown that these two peptides are not expressed in the Aplysia nervous system, and we have therefore labeled the unknown peptides stained by these two antibodies as XSOM and XPHI There was an area at the anterior end of the cerebral ganglion that had staining by antisera raised against many different transmitters, suggesting that this may be a modulatory region of the nervous system. There was also staining for XSOM and, in some cases, FMRFamide in the bag cell cluster of the abdominal ganglion. In addition, these and other studies have revealed a fairly high degree of colocalization of different neuropeptides in individual neurons, suggesting that the peptides do not just act independently but can also interact in different combinations to produce complex functions. The simple nervous system of Aplysia is advantageous for further testing these ideas.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aplysia", "FMRFamide", "Central Nervous System", "Neuropeptides", "Ganglia", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA rdh1@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lennart", "Last Name": "Brodin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm S-17177, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Elvar", "Last Name": "Theodorsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Division of Clinical Chemistry and Pharmacology, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping S-58185, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "\u00c1kos", "Last Name": "V\u00e9gv\u00e1ri", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm S-17177, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Eric R", "Last Name": "Kandel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Hokfelt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm S-17177, Sweden."}], "Journal": "Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2023May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "37352738", "Title": "Temporal Cluster Analysis of Deep Sternal Wound Infection in a Regional Quality Collaborative.", "Abstract": "Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) is a rare complication associated with high mortality.

Group coordination often brings to mind synchrony and alignment, where all individuals do the same thing (e.g., driving on the right side of the road, marching in lockstep, or playing musical instruments on a regular beat). Yet, effective coordination also typically involves differentiation, where specialized roles emerge for different members (e.g., prep stations in a kitchen or positions on an athletic team). Role specialization poses a challenge for computational models of group coordination, which have largely focused on achieving synchrony. Here, we present the CARMI framework, which characterizes role specialization processes in terms of five core features that we hope will help guide future model development: Communication, Adaptation to feedback, Repulsion, Multi-level planning, and Intention modeling. Although there are many paths to role formation, we suggest that roles emerge when each agent in a group dynamically allocates their behavior toward a shared goal to complement what they expect others to do. In other words, coordination concerns beliefs (who will do what) rather than simple actions.

Persuasion raises a number of challenges for classical accounts of belief updating, as information cannot be taken at face value. How should listeners account for a speaker's \"hidden agenda\" when incorporating new information? Here, we extend recent probabilistic models of recursive social reasoning to allow for persuasive goals and show that our model provides a pragmatic account for why weakly favorable arguments may backfire, a phenomenon known as the weak evidence effect. Critically, this model predicts a systematic relationship between belief updates and expectations about the information source: weak evidence should only backfire when speakers are expected to act under persuasive goals and prefer the strongest evidence. We introduce a simple experimental paradigm called the Stick Contest to measure the extent to which the weak evidence effect depends on speaker expectations, and show that a pragmatic listener model accounts for the empirical data better than alternative models.

Patient discharge to lower-star quality SNFs has been shown to adversely impact surgical outcomes. Recent data has shown that over 20% of patients are discharged to an SNF after CABG, but the link between SNF quality and CABG outcomes has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of SNF quality ratings on postoperative outcomes after CABG. Retrospective cohort review of Medicare patients undergoing CABG and discharged to an SNF between the years 2016-2017. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the star rating of the SNF with receipt of care after discharge (ie, below average, average, above average). Risk-adjusted 30-day to 1-year outcomes of mortality, readmission, and SNF length of stay were calculated and compared using multivariable logistic regression and Poisson models across SNF quality categories. Of the 73,164 Medicare patients in our sample, 15,522 (21.2%) were discharged to an SNF. Patients in below average SNFs were more likely to be younger, Black, Medicare/Medicaid dual eligible, and have more comorbidities. Compared to above average SNFs, patients discharged to below average SNFs experienced higher risk-adjusted 30-day mortality (2.1% vs 1.6%, P<0.02), readmission (21.6% vs 19.3%, P<0.01) and SNF length of stay (17.3d vs 16.5d, P<0.0001). Within 90-days, below average SNFs experienced higher risk-adjusted readmission rates (31.7% vs 30.0%, P<0.004). Outcomes at 1-year were not statistically significant. Medicare beneficiaries discharged to lower quality SNFs experienced worse postoperative outcomes after CABG.

This retrospective analysis reports a single-center experience of nonselected autologous TILs derived from digested tumors for compassionate use treatment of advanced cutaneous melanoma, including after programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibition. Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic cutaneous melanoma and no standard-of-care treatment options underwent tumor resection for TIL product manufacturing. Patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide for 2 days and fludarabine for 5 days, followed by a single TIL infusion and post-TIL high-dose interleukin (IL)-2. Safety assessments included clinically significant adverse events (AEs). Efficacy assessments included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival. Between October 2011 and August 2019, 21 patients underwent treatment (median follow-up time, 52.2 months from TIL infusion). Among all treated patients, median age was 45 years, median number of disease sites was 4, 100% had M1c or M1d disease, and 90% received prior checkpoint inhibitor. Twelve patients received TILs after prior PD-1 inhibition. The safety profile among all treated patients and the prior PD-1 inhibitor subgroup was generally consistent with lymphodepletion and high-dose IL-2. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Among all patients, the ORR was 67%, CR rate was 19%, and the DCR was 86%, which was consistent with that observed in the prior PD-1 inhibitor subgroup (58%, 8%, and 75%, respectively). Median overall survival in all treated patients and the prior PD-1 inhibitor subgroup was 21.3 months. In total, 5 patients (24%) had durable ongoing responses (>30 months post-TIL infusion) at data cutoff, and all patients who achieved CR remained alive and disease free. To further illustrate how TIL therapy may integrate into established treatment paradigms, several case studies of patients treated in this series were included. Overall, these data demonstrate that manufacturing of nonselected autologous TILs from tumor digests is feasible and resulted in high rates of durable response in poor-risk patient populations, which may address significant unmet medical need.", "Keywords": ["PD-1 inhibitor", "T cell", "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes", "checkpoint inhibition", "compassionate use", "immunology", "immunotherapy", "interleukin-2", "melanoma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manon", "Last Name": "Pillai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie, NHS Foundation Trust Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yizhou", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Instil Bio, Inc.

Multiple GnRH isoforms and receptors have been detected outside the HPG-axis across different species. In this review, we focus on the human CNS where GnRH I and II isoforms and a functional GnRH I receptor have been isolated. We first describe the traditional understanding of GnRH within the hypothalamus and the pituitary and current clinical use of GnRH analogues. We then review the location and function of GnRH-producing neurons and receptors located outside the HPG axis. We next review the GnRH I and II neuron location and quantity and GnRH I receptor gene expression throughout the human brain, using the Allen Brain Map Atlas. This analysis demonstrates a wide expression of GnRH throughout the brain, including prominent expression in the basal forebrain and cerebellum.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of high dose IL-2 therapy on cardiopulmonary structure and function. Combined cardiopulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 7 patients in the acute period following IL-2 therapy and repeated in 4 patients in the chronic period. Comparison was made to 10 healthy volunteers. IL-2 therapy was associated with myocardial and pulmonary capillary leak, tissue oedema and cardiomyocyte injury, which resulted in acute significant left ventricular (LV) dilatation, a reduction in LV ejection fraction (EF), an increase in LV mass and a prolongation of QT interval. The acute effects occurred irrespective of symptoms. In the chronic period many of the effects resolved, but LV hypertrophy ensued, driven by focal replacement and diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis and increased cardiomyocyte mass. In conclusion, IL-2 therapy is ubiquitously associated with acute cardiopulmonary inflammation, irrespective of symptoms, which leads to acute LV dilatation and dysfunction, increased LV mass and QT interval prolongation. Most of these effects are reversible but IL-2 therapy is associated with chronic LV hypertrophy, driven by interstitial myocardial fibrosis and increased cardiomyocyte mass.

Yet, language use in a variable and nonstationary social environment requires linguistic representations to be flexible: Old words acquire new ad hoc or partner-specific meanings on the fly. In this article, we introduce continual hierarchical adaptation through inference (CHAI), a hierarchical Bayesian theory of coordination and convention formation that aims to reconcile the long-standing tension between these two basic observations. We argue that the central computational problem of communication is not simply transmission, as in classical formulations, but continual learning and adaptation over multiple timescales. Partner-specific common ground quickly emerges from social inferences within dyadic interactions, while community-wide social conventions are stable priors that have been abstracted away from interactions with multiple partners. We present new empirical data alongside simulations showing how our model provides a computational foundation for several phenomena that have posed a challenge for previous accounts: (a) the convergence to more efficient referring expressions across repeated interaction with the same partner, (b) the gradual transfer of partner-specific common ground to strangers, and (c) the influence of communicative context on which conventions eventually form.

Here we demonstrate that Panx1 on endothelial cells, but not smooth muscle cells, orchestrate a cascade of signaling events to mediate vascular inflammation and remodeling. Mechanistically, Panx1 on endothelial cells acts as a conduit for ATP release that stimulates macrophage activation via P2X7 receptors and mitochondrial DNA release to increase IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1 secretion. Secondly, Panx1 signaling regulates smooth muscle cell-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release and vascular remodeling via P2Y2 receptors.

We found that S6 activation was more common in poor risk NC-RCC tumors and S6/Akt activation was associated with worse PFS and OS outcomes with both everolimus and sunitinib, while c-kit was commonly expressed in chromophobe tumors and associated with improved outcomes with both agents. C-MET was commonly expressed in papillary tumors and was associated with lower rates of radiographic response but did not predict PFS for either agent.

However, studies of long-term facilitation at Aplysia sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses in isolated cell culture suggest two additional features of facilitation. First, that there is also regulation of the number of synaptic contacts between two neurons, which may occur at the level of cell pair-specific branch points in the neuronal arbor. Branch points contain many molecules that are involved in protein synthesis-dependent long-term facilitation including neurotrophins and the RNA binding protein CPEB. Second, the regulation involves homeostatic feedback and tends to keep the total number of contacts between two neurons at a fairly constant level both at rest and following facilitation. That raises the question of how facilitation and homeostasis can coexist. A possible answer is suggested by the findings that they both involve spontaneous transmission and postsynaptic Ca2+, which can have bidirectional effects similar to LTP and LTD in hippocampus. In addition, long-term facilitation can involve a change in the set point of homeostasis, which could be encoded by plasticity molecules such as CPEB and/or PKM.

Yet adults routinely engage in effortful processes when needed. How, then, should speakers and listeners allocate their resources to achieve successful communication? We begin with the observation that the shared goal of communication induces a natural division of labor: The resources one agent chooses to allocate toward perspective-taking should depend on their expectations about the other's allocation. We formalize this idea in a resource-rational model augmenting recent probabilistic weighting accounts with a mechanism for (costly) control over the degree of perspective-taking. In a series of simulations, we first derive an intermediate degree of perspective weighting as an optimal trade-off between expected costs and benefits of perspective-taking. We then present two behavioral experiments testing novel predictions of our model. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the presence or absence of occlusions in a director-matcher task. We found that speakers spontaneously modulated the informativeness of their descriptions to account for \"known unknowns\" in their partner's private view, reflecting a higher degree of speaker perspective-taking than previously acknowledged. In Experiment 2, we then compared the scripted utterances used by confederates in prior work with those produced in interactions with unscripted directors. We found that confederates were systematically less informative than listeners would initially expect given the presence of occlusions, but listeners used violations to adaptively make fewer errors over time. Taken together, our work suggests that people are not simply \"mindblind\"; they use contextually appropriate expectations to navigate the division of labor with their partner. We discuss how a resource-rational framework may provide a more deeply explanatory foundation for understanding flexible perspective-taking under processing constraints.", "Keywords": ["Communication", "Pragmatics", "Resource rationality", "Theory of mind"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Communication", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University."}, {"First Name": "Hyowon", "Last Name": "Gweon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University."}, {"First Name": "Noah D", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University."}], "Journal": "Cognitive science", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33676759", "Title": "Longitudinal analysis of National Institutes of Health funding for academic thoracic surgeons.", "Abstract": "National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for academic (noncardiac) thoracic surgeons at the top-140 NIH-funded institutes in the United States was assessed.

A total of 96 AABL PLWH were recruited from a larger study of PLWH with non-suppressed HIV viral load. They engaged in structured assessments focused on knowledge, testing, trust in information sources, and potential emotional, social, and behavioral impacts. Twenty-six of these participants were randomly selected for in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants were mostly men (64%), African American/Black (75%), and had lived with HIV for 17 years, on average (SD=9 years). Quantitative results revealed high levels of concern about and the adoption of recommended COVID-19 prevention recommendations. HIV care visits were commonly canceled but, overall, engagement in HIV care and antiretroviral therapy use were not seriously disrupted. Trust in local sources of information was higher than trust in various federal sources. Qualitative findings complemented and enriched quantitative results and provided a multifaceted description of both risk factors (e.g., phones/internet access were inadequate for some forms of telehealth) and resilience (e.g., \"hustling\" for food supplies).

No studies have previously reported angiographically confirmed CR rates post-CABG. This study's aim was to assess the impact upon long-term outcomes of CR versus incomplete revascularization (IR), confirmed by coronary angiography 1 year after CABG. Randomized On/Off Bypass Study patients who returned for protocol-specified 1-year post-CABG coronary angiograms were included. Patients with a widely patent graft supplying the major diseased artery within each diseased coronary territory were considered to have CR. Outcomes were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization) over the 4 years after angiography. Of the 1,276 patients, 756 (59%) had CR and 520 (41%) had IR. MACE was 13% CR versus 26% IR, p <0.001. This difference was driven by fewer repeat revascularizations (5% CR vs 18% IR; p <0.001). There were no differences in mortality (7.1% CR vs 8.1% IR, p\u202f=\u202f0.13) or myocardial infarction (4% in both). Adjusted multivariable models confirmed CR was associated with reduced MACE (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.58, p <0.01), but had no impact on mortality. In conclusion, CR confirmed by post-CABG angiography was associated with improved MACE but not mortality.

We conducted a prespecified analysis of the randomised, phase 3 IMmotion151 trial in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic RCC to assess the effectiveness of atezolizumab\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab versus sunitinib in a subgroup of patients with sarcomatoid features. Patients whose tumour had any component of sarcomatoid features were included and received atezolizumab\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab (n\u2009=\u200968) or sunitinib (n\u2009=\u200974). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group receiving atezolizumab\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab overall (8.3 vs 5.3 mo; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.79) and in the subset of patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (8.6 vs 5.6 mo; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.77). More patients receiving atezolizumab\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab achieved an objective response (49% vs 14%), including complete responses (10% vs 3%), and reported greater symptom improvements versus sunitinib. Safety was consistent with the known profiles of each drug and with that reported in the overall safety-evaluable population of IMmotion151. This analysis supports enhanced activity of atezolizumab\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab in patients with sRCC. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at patients with a specific type of kidney cancer (tumours with sarcomatoid features) that has been hard to treat. A treatment with two drugs (atezolizumab and bevacizumab) appeared to help patients live longer without the disease getting worse than another drug (sunitinib) that is often used. Patients who took the two drugs also said they were better able to carry out their everyday activities than patients who took sunitinib. The combination of these two drugs may work better in patients with this type of advanced kidney cancer.", "Keywords": ["IMmotion151", "RCC", "atezolizumab", "bevacizumab", "metastatic renal cell carcinoma", "sRCC", "sarcomatoid"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bevacizumab", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Sunitinib"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian I", "Last Name": "Rini", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

Whilst the recent successes of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for haematological malignancies are widely known, they have yet to show great success in solid cancers. However, immune cells transduced with T-cell receptors have been shown to traffic to and exert anti-cancer effects on solid tumour cells with some great successes. In this review, we explore the field of transgenic T-cell receptor immunotherapy, highlighting some of the key clinical trials which have paved the way for this type of cellular immunotherapy. Some trials have shown amazing clinical results, including long-term remissions and minimal toxicity, and can be looked at as an exemplar for this adoptive cell therapy. There have also been key trials where unexpected, fatal, off-tumour toxicity has occurred, and these trials have also been instrumental in shaping safer clinical trials, particularly regarding preclinical testing. In addition to previous trials, we analysed the current clinical trial space for T-cell receptor T-cell therapy, showing which trials are dominating in the clinic and which targets are being prioritised by researchers around the world.

In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively).

We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference.

Crucially, we relax the assumption that informativeness is computed with respect to a deterministic Boolean semantics, in favor of a nondeterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a large number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the basic asymmetry in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light on the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully overinformative, reference is usefully redundant.

We have addressed this question by comparing mechanisms of a nonassociative form of learning, sensitization, and an associative form of learning, classical conditioning of the siphon-withdrawal reflex of hermaphroditic Aplysia In an analog of differential conditioning, action potentials in one siphon sensory neuron (SN) were paired with shock to the pedal nerves, producing activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation, and action potentials in another SN were unpaired with the shock as a control. The difference between paired and unpaired training is a measure of associative plasticity. Before and after this training, we voltage clamped each SN and measured the outward current during depolarizing pulses. There was a significantly greater decrease in the net outward current in the paired SN than in the unpaired SN. We obtained similar results when we substituted the depolarizing voltage clamp pulse for action potentials during training. We then bathed the ganglion in serotonin as a measure of nonassociative plasticity. The current that was modulated differentially (paired-unpaired) had time and voltage dependencies similar to the current that was modulated by serotonin (I s). These results suggest that an associative form of plasticity, activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation underlying conditioning, involves enhanced modulation of the same ionic current as a nonassociative form, normal presynaptic facilitation underlying sensitization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Aplysia", "Association Learning", "Behavior, Animal", "Central Nervous System Sensitization", "Conditioning, Classical", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Reflex", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Serotonin", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric R", "Last Name": "Kandel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2019Nov"}, {"PMID": "31609510", "Title": "Primary graft dysfunction after heart transplantation: Outcomes and resource utilization.", "Abstract": "A unified definition of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after heart transplantation was adopted in 2014, with moderate and severe PGD defined as a need for mechanical circulatory support.

However, in many cases learning-related plasticity also involves changes in the excitability of neurons. These findings have raised questions about the relative importance of these two types of mechanisms to behavioral learning, and also about the extent to which they involve shared or unique molecular mechanisms. We have taken a reductionist approach to these questions by addressing them in a simple model organism, Aplysia californica. Studies of a semi-intact Aplysia siphon withdrawal preparation suggest that classical conditioning involves an increase in the evoked firing of sensory neurons (SNs) as well as facilitation of the monosynaptic PSP to motor neurons (MNs). Furthermore, these two mechanisms may act cooperatively at the cellular level: increased SN firing produces more PSPs, each of which is facilitated, leading to a multiplicative increase in depolarization of the MN and siphon withdrawal. The changes in SN firing and the monosynaptic PSP also share several mechanisms at the molecular level, suggesting that they may both be due in part to a decrease in K+ current that causes an increase in SN excitability as well as an increase in SN spike width and thus increased transmitter release. However, changes in the monosynaptic PSP also involve additional mechanisms that are not shared and may affect different aspects of synaptic transmission as well. Studies of operant conditioning of feeding suggest that it involves similar mechanisms as classical conditioning of siphon withdrawal. In particular, for both types of associative learning adenylyl cyclase appears to serve as a molecular coincidence detector that leads to increased activation of PKA and changes in excitability of key neurons in the neural circuit. Furthermore, in both cases those changes in excitability make an important contribution to the behavioral learning.", "Keywords": ["Aplysia", "Classical conditioning", "Excitability", "Learning", "Operant conditioning"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aplysia", "Association Learning", "Conditioning, Classical", "Conditioning, Operant", "Motor Neurons", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Signal Transduction", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, United States; Division of Systems Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, United States.

The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between patients receiving treatment for MAA. Records were obtained and patients with MAA were stratified by intervention: endovascular repair, open surgery, and medical therapy. Primary outcomes were aneurysm-related mortality and survival. Risk-adjusted associations with mortality were assessed using time-to-event analysis. Thirty-eight patients were identified (median age, 67). Twenty-one underwent endovascular repair,10 had open surgery and 7 received medical therapy alone. Overall mortality was 47% (n = 18), with 94% aneurysm related. Median survival was significantly longer in the endovascular group (747.0 [161-1249]) vs open surgery and medical therapy (507.5 [34-806] and 66 [13-146] days, respectively; P = .02). The endovascular group had significantly fewer perioperative complications (43% vs 80%, P < .01). However, 4 endovascular patients experienced reinfection versus no open surgery patients. Mortality risk factors included medical therapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.3, P < .01) and aneurysm size (HR: 1.4 per 1-cm increase in diameter, P = .03).

Commutable whole blood certified reference materials (CRMs) are needed in the measurement of HbA1c for method validation and/or as quality controls. Methods We developed three levels of hemolyzed whole blood CRMs for HbA1c. The certified values were determined using liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-IDMS/MS) where two \"signature\" hexapeptides of HbA1c and hemoglobin A0 (HbA0) were used as the calibration standards. The concentrations of the hexapeptide solutions were determined by amino acid analysis by the LC-IDMS/MS method using amino acid CRMs as the calibration standards. The commutability study was conducted by measuring 25 patient specimens and the whole blood CRMs by both LC-IDMS/MS method and various routine methods using six different clinical analyzers. Results The certified values were determined to be 35.1\u00b12.0, 50.3\u00b11.9 and 65.8\u00b12.6 mmol/mol, respectively. These CRMs showed good commutability on five of the six clinical analyzers but showed poor commutability on one of the clinical analyzers that used similar method as two other analyzers where good commutability was observed. Conclusions With certified target values based on metrological traceability and good commutability on most of the clinical analyzers, the developed whole blood CRMs can be used for method validation or as quality control materials in the measurement of HbA1c. The commutability study results also underscored the need of commutability testing of clinical CRMs using various clinical analyzers.", "Keywords": ["certified reference material", "commutability", "diabetes", "hemoglobin A1c", "isotope dilution mass spectrometry"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Chemical Analysis", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Protein Stability", "Reference Standards", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Lingkai", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Yong", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Qinde", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, 1 Science Park Road, #01-05/06, The Capricorn, Singapore Science Park II, Singapore 117528, Singapore, Phone: +65 67751605 ext 102, Fax: +65 67751398."}, {"First Name": "Tang Lin", "Last Name": "Teo", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Tong Kooi", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Chemical Metrology Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Tze Ping", "Last Name": "Loh", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Sunil Kumar", "Last Name": "Sethi", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Moh Sim", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Shelia Marie Delos Santos", "Last Name": "Cosio", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Clement K M", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Johnson Weng Sung", "Last Name": "Setoh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Sok Fong Maria", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Laboratory Department, Mount Alvernia Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Grace Lay Lay", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Laboratory - Headquarter, National Healthcare Group Diagnostics, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Hafash", "Last Name": "Khalid", "Affiliation": "Laboratory - Woodlands Polyclinic, National Healthcare Group Diagnostics, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Sharine", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Laboratory - Bukit Batok Polyclinic, National Healthcare Group Diagnostics, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Choong-Weng", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Mee-Yin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Chin Pin", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Pallavi Ravikiran", "Last Name": "Chincholkar", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Bih-Yann", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}], "Journal": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "PubDate": "2019Apr24"}, {"PMID": "30522867", "Title": "The Emergence of Social Norms and Conventions.", "Abstract": "The utility of our actions frequently depends upon the beliefs and behavior of other agents.

Validation of retroviral transduction, and confirmation of the ability of CAR T cells to kill target lymphoma cells ex vivo, through the use of flow cytometry, luminometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is also described.

Although most patients achieve an initial complete response with first-line treatment, recurrence occurs in more than 80% of cases. Thus, there is a clear unmet need for novel second-line treatments. EOC is frequently infiltrated with T lymphocytes, the presence of which has been shown to be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) using ex vivo-expanded tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has shown remarkable efficacy in other immunogenic tumours, and may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for EOC. In this preclinical study, we investigated the efficacy of using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 magnetic beads and IL-2 to expand TILs from freshly resected ovarian tumours. TILs were expanded for up to 3\u00a0weeks, and then subjected to a rapid-expansion protocol (REP) using irradiated feeder cells. Tumours were collected from 45 patients with EOC and TILs were successfully expanded from 89.7% of biopsies. Expanded CD4+\u2009and CD8+\u2009subsets demonstrated features associated with memory phenotypes, and had significantly higher expression of key activation and functional markers than unexpanded TILs.

Larger studies have shown \u223c90% complete remission rates against chemoresistant and/or refractory CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma. Effective CAR T\u00a0cell therapy is highly dependent on lymphodepleting preconditioning, which is achieved through chemotherapy or radiotherapy that carries with it significant toxicities. These can exclude patients of low performance status. In order to overcome the need for preconditioning, we constructed fully mouse first and second generation anti-murine CD19 CARs with or without interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion. To test these CARs, we established a mouse model to reflect the human situation without preconditioning. Murine second generation CAR T\u00a0cells expressing IL-12 were capable of eradicating established B cell lymphoma with a long-term survival rate of \u223c25%. We believe this to be the first study in a truly lymphoreplete model. We provide evidence that IL-12-expressing CAR T\u00a0cells not only directly kill target CD19+ cells, but also recruit host immune cells to an anti-cancer immune response. This finding is critical because lymphodepletion regimens required for the success of current CAR T\u00a0cell technology eliminate host immune cells whose anti-cancer activity could otherwise be harnessed by strategies such as IL-12-secreting CAR T\u00a0cells.", "Keywords": ["B cell malignancies", "CD19 CAR T\u00a0cells", "IL-12", "TRUCKs", "adoptive cellular therapy", "chimeric antigen receptor", "immunotherapy", "lymphoma", "pre-conditioning"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gray", "Last Name": "Kueberuwa", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester M20 4QL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Milena", "Last Name": "Kalaitsidou", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester M20 4QL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Eleanor", "Last Name": "Cheadle", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester M20 4QL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Robert Edward", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester M20 4QL, UK."}, {"First Name": "David Edward", "Last Name": "Gilham", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester M20 4QL, UK."}], "Journal": "Molecular therapy oncolytics", "PubDate": "2018Mar30"}, {"PMID": "29361300", "Title": "Cardiothoracic surgery training grants provide protected research time vital to the development of academic surgeons.", "Abstract": "The Ruth L.

Three cohorts of patients received increasing doses of CEACAM5+-specific CAR T cells after fludarabine pre-conditioning plus systemic IL2 support post T cell infusion. Patients in cohort 4 received increased intensity pre-conditioning (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine), systemic IL2 support and CAR T cells. No objective clinical responses were observed. CAR T cell engraftment in patients within cohort 4 was significantly higher. However, engraftment was short-lived with a rapid decline of systemic CAR T cells within 14\u00a0days. Patients in cohort 4 had transient, acute respiratory toxicity which, in combination with lack of prolonged CAR T cell persistence, resulted in the premature closure of the trial. Elevated levels of systemic IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 implied that the CEACAM5-specific T cells had undergone immune activation in vivo but only in patients receiving high-intensity pre-conditioning. Expression of CEACAM5 on lung epithelium may have resulted in this transient toxicity. Raised levels of serum cytokines including IL-6 in these patients implicate cytokine release as one of several potential factors exacerbating the observed respiratory toxicity. Whilst improved CAR designs and T cell production methods could improve the systemic persistence and activity, methods to control CAR T 'on-target, off-tissue' toxicity are required to enable a clinical impact of this approach in solid malignancies.", "Keywords": ["CEA", "Chimeric antigen receptor", "Persistence", "T cells", "Toxicity"], "MeSH terms": ["Abdominal Pain", "Adult", "Aged", "Anemia", "Carcinoembryonic Antigen", "Cohort Studies", "Cyclophosphamide", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Female", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-6", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myeloablative Agonists", "Neoplasms", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes", "Treatment Outcome", "Vidarabine", "Vomiting"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fiona C", "Last Name": "Thistlethwaite", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK. fiona.thistlethwaite@christie.nhs.uk."}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Gilham", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ryan D", "Last Name": "Guest", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dominic G", "Last Name": "Rothwell", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Manon", "Last Name": "Pillai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Deborah J", "Last Name": "Burt", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andrea J", "Last Name": "Byatte", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Kirillova", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Juan W", "Last Name": "Valle", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Surinder K", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kerry A", "Last Name": "Chester", "Affiliation": "University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nigel B", "Last Name": "Westwood", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E R", "Last Name": "Halford", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Nabarro", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Stem Cells and Immunotherapy, National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) Liverpool Centre, Speke, Liverpool, UK."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK."}], "Journal": "Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII", "PubDate": "2017Nov"}, {"PMID": "28655549", "Title": "Lower extremity bypass for critical limb ischemia decreases major adverse limb events with equivalent cardiac risk compared with endovascular intervention.", "Abstract": "Lower extremity bypass (LEB) has traditionally been the \"gold standard\" in the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).

Here, we explore a communication scheme that relaxes the assumption that information travels exclusively through optimally short paths. The scheme assumes that communication between a pair of brain regions may take place through a path ensemble comprising the k-shortest paths between those regions. To explore this approach, we map path ensembles in a set of anatomical brain networks derived from diffusion imaging and tractography. We show that while considering optimally short paths excludes a significant fraction of network connections from participating in communication, considering k-shortest path ensembles allows all connections in the network to contribute. Path ensembles enable us to assess the resilience of communication pathways between brain regions, by measuring the number of alternative, disjoint paths within the ensemble, and to compare generalized measures of path length and betweenness centrality to those that result when considering only the single shortest path between node pairs. Furthermore, we find a significant correlation, indicative of a trade-off, between communication efficiency and resilience of communication pathways in structural brain networks. Finally, we use k-shortest path ensembles to demonstrate hemispherical lateralization of efficiency and resilience.", "Keywords": ["Communication efficiency", "Communication resilience", "Connectomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Connectome", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Pathways", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Avena-Koenigsberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bratislav", "Last Name": "Mi\u0161i\u0107", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert X D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Griffa", "Affiliation": "Signal Processing Lab., Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Patric", "Last Name": "Hagmann", "Affiliation": "Signal Processing Lab., Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Joaqu\u00edn", "Last Name": "Go\u00f1i", "Affiliation": "School of Industrial Engineering and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA. jgonicor@purdue.edu."}, {"First Name": "Olaf", "Last Name": "Sporns", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA. osporns@indiana.edu."}], "Journal": "Brain structure & function", "PubDate": "2017Jan"}, {"PMID": "27238083", "Title": "Premature Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Degeneration Associated with Allergy to Galactose-Alpha-1,3-Galactose.", "Abstract": "We present the cases of two patients with bioprosthetic aortic valves who developed an allergy to alpha-gal.

Using Stone's (2012) policy analysis framework, this article explores how A-H limits welfare, liberty, and security among adolescents due to the poor empirical outcomes of AOE policy.

We experimentally investigate two factors contributing to the formation of conventions in a game of impure coordination: the continuity of interaction within each round of play (simultaneous vs. real-time) and the stakes of the interaction (high vs. low differences between payoffs). To maximize efficiency and fairness in this game, players must coordinate on one of two equally advantageous equilibria. In agreement with other studies manipulating continuity of interaction, we find that players who were allowed to interact continuously within rounds achieved outcomes with greater efficiency and fairness than players who were forced to make simultaneous decisions. However, the stability of equilibria in the real-time condition varied systematically and dramatically with stakes: players converged on more stable patterns of behavior when stakes are high. To account for this result, we present a novel analysis of the dynamics of continuous interaction and signaling within rounds. We discuss this previously unconsidered interaction between within-trial and across-trial dynamics as a form of social canalization. When stakes are low in a real-time environment, players can satisfactorily coordinate 'on the fly', but when stakes are high there is increased pressure to establish and adhere to shared expectations that persist across rounds.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cooperative Behavior", "Decision Theory", "Game Theory", "Games, Experimental", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert X D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert L", "Last Name": "Goldstone", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26951309", "Title": "Randomized Open-Label Phase II Trial of Apitolisib (GDC-0980), a Novel Inhibitor of the PI3K/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway, Versus Everolimus in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.", "Abstract": "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare dual inhibition of PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by apitolisib (GDC-0980) against single inhibition of mTORC1 by everolimus in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Disease-Free Survival", "Everolimus", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Middle Aged", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrimidines", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Powles", "Affiliation": "Thomas Powles, Queen Mary University of London, London; Christy Ralph, University of Leeds, Leeds; Janet E.

False-positives lead to unnecessary biopsies with attendant morbidities. This is the first prospective validation study of %p2PSA and the Prostate Health Index (PHI) in Asian men presenting with a total PSA between 4.0 and 10 ng ml-1 . We studied 157 Asian men between 50 and 75 years old, with normal per rectal prostate examinations, undergoing their first prostate biopsy, using a standardized biopsy protocol, for PSA levels of 4-10 ng ml-1 . Thirty (19.1%) were found to have prostate cancer on biopsy. Statistically significant differences between patients with and without prostate cancer were found for total PSA, p2PSA, %p2PSA, and PHI. The areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for total PSA, %fPSA, %p2PSA, and PHI were 0.479, 0.420, 0.695, and 0.794, respectively. PHI predicts prostatic biopsies results best. At a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity (95% CI) of PHI was 58.3%, more than triple the specificity of total PSA at 17.3%, potentially avoiding 77 (49%) unnecessary biopsies. Similar to studies in mainly Caucasian populations, we have prospectively shown that %p2PSA and PHI greatly outperform total and free to total PSA ratio, in the detection of prostate cancer at first biopsy. Higher PHI levels also correspond to increasing the risk of detecting GS \u22657 cancers.

Here, we characterized the HCN gene organization, channel properties, distribution, and involvement in associative and nonassociative forms of learning in Aplysia californica. Aplysia has only one HCN gene, which codes for a channel that has many similarities to the mammalian HCN channel. The cloned acHCN gene was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, which displayed a hyperpolarization-induced inward current that was enhanced by cGMP as well as cAMP. Similarly to its homologs in other animals, acHCN is permeable to K(+) and Na(+) ions, and is selectively blocked by Cs(+) and ZD7288. We found that acHCN is predominantly expressed in inter- and motor neurons, including LFS siphon motor neurons, and therefore tested whether HCN channels are involved in simple forms of learning of the siphon-withdrawal reflex in a semiintact preparation. ZD7288 (100 \u03bcM) significantly reduced an associative form of learning (classical conditioning) but had no effect on two nonassociative forms of learning (intermediate-term sensitization and unpaired training) or baseline responses. The HCN current is enhanced by nitric oxide (NO), which may explain the postsynaptic role of NO during conditioning. HCN current in turn enhances the NMDA-like current in the motor neurons, suggesting that HCN channels contribute to conditioning through this pathway.", "Keywords": ["Aplysia", "HCN channels", "NMDA", "learning and memory", "nitric oxide"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Conditioning, Classical", "Cyclic AMP", "Cyclic GMP", "Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels", "Female", "Ion Transport", "Membrane Potentials", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Motor Neurons", "Nitric Oxide", "Oocytes", "Potassium", "Pyrimidines", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Sodium", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qizong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Pavlo", "Last Name": "Kuzyk", "Affiliation": "Whitney Laboratory for Marine Biosciences, University of Florida, St. Augustine, FL 32080;"}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Antonov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Caleb J", "Last Name": "Bostwick", "Affiliation": "Whitney Laboratory for Marine Biosciences, University of Florida, St. Augustine, FL 32080; Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610;"}, {"First Name": "Andrea B", "Last Name": "Kohn", "Affiliation": "Whitney Laboratory for Marine Biosciences, University of Florida, St. Augustine, FL 32080;"}, {"First Name": "Leonid L", "Last Name": "Moroz", "Affiliation": "Whitney Laboratory for Marine Biosciences, University of Florida, St. Augustine, FL 32080; Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610; rdh1@columbia.edu moroz@whitney.ufl.edu."}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Division of Neurobiology and Behavior, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032 rdh1@columbia.edu moroz@whitney.ufl.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2015Dec29"}, {"PMID": "26652520", "Title": "Invited Commentary.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Humans", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, PO Box 800709, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0709."}, {"First Name": "Gorav", "Last Name": "Ailawadi", "Affiliation": "Division of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, PO Box 800709, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0709.

Measuring emergent features with the capacity coefficient.", "Abstract": "While there is widespread agreement among vision researchers on the importance of some local aspects of visual stimuli, such as hue and intensity, there is no general consensus on a full set of basic sources of information used in perceptual tasks or how they are processed. Gestalt theories place particular value on emergent features, which are based on the higher-order relationships among elements of a stimulus rather than local properties. Thus, arbitrating between different accounts of features is an important step in arbitrating between local and Gestalt theories of perception in general. In this paper, we present the capacity coefficient from Systems Factorial Technology (SFT) as a quantitative approach for formalizing and rigorously testing predictions made by local and Gestalt theories of features. As a simple, easily controlled domain for testing this approach, we focus on the local feature of location and the emergent features of Orientation and Proximity in a pair of dots. We introduce a redundant-target change detection task to compare our capacity measure on (1) trials where the configuration of the dots changed along with their location against (2) trials where the amount of local location change was exactly the same, but there was no change in the configuration. Our results, in conjunction with our modeling tools, favor the Gestalt account of emergent features. We conclude by suggesting several candidate information-processing models that incorporate emergent features, which follow from our approach.", "Keywords": ["Perceptual organization", "Visual perception", "Workload capacity"], "MeSH terms": ["Analysis of Variance", "Attention", "Gestalt Theory", "Humans", "Models, Psychological", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Perceptual Masking", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert X D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Indiana University, Bloomington, United States.

Basic classical conditioning is caused in part by activity-dependent facilitation at sensory neuron-motor neuron (SN-MN) synapses and involves a hybrid combination of activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and Hebbian potentiation, which are coordinated by trans-synaptic signaling. Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, which might be explained by the known circuit connections in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding. However, for both classical and operant conditioning, adenylyl cyclase is a molecular site of convergence of the two signals that are associated.

Patients with such pattern of reduction and expansion of Nap-binding T cells also showed increased levels of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 in plasma 3 hours after the first Nap treatment.

To determine whether the second-generation CAR was essential for optimal antitumor activity, two CD28-based CAR constructs targeting CD19 were tested for their ability to redirect mouse T cell function against established B cell lymphoma in a BALB/c syngeneic model system. T cells armed with either CAR eliminated A20 B cell lymphoma in vivo; however, one construct induced a T cell dose-dependent acute toxicity associated with a raised serum Th1 type cytokine profile on transfer into preconditioned mice. Moreover, a chronic toxicity manifested as granuloma-like formation in spleen, liver, and lymph nodes was observed in animals receiving T cells bearing either CD28 CAR, albeit with different kinetics dependent upon the specific receptor used. This phenotype was associated with an expansion of CD4+ CAR+ T cells and CD11b+ Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and increased serum Th2-type cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-13. Mouse T cells engrafted with a first-generation CAR failed to develop such autotoxicity, whereas toxicity was not apparent when T cells bearing the same receptors were transferred into C57BL/6 or C3H animals. In summary, the adoptive transfer of second-generation CD19-specific CAR T cells can result in a cell dose-dependent acute toxicity, whereas the prolonged secretion of high levels of Th2 cytokines from these CAR T cells in vivo drives a granulomatous reaction resulting in chronic toxicity.

It seems that a combination of (1) activation of immune effector cells and selective targeting of them to tumors and (2) the inhibition of immune suppression often induced by the tumor itself are necessary to achieve the therapeutic goal. The immunotoxin naptumomab estafenatox was developed in an effort to activate and target the patient's own T cells to their tumor, by fusing a superantigen (SAg) variant that activates T lymphocytes to the Fab moiety of a tumor-reactive monoclonal antibody. Naptumomab estafenatox targets the 5T4 tumor antigen, a 72-kDa oncofetal trophoblast protein expressed on many carcinomas, including renal cell carcinoma. The therapeutic effect is associated with activation of SAg-binding T cells. The SAg-binding T lymphocytes expand, differentiate to effector cells, and infiltrate the tumor. The therapeutic efficacy is most likely related to the dual mechanism of tumor cell killing: (1) direct lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes of tumor cells expressing the antigen recognized by the antibody moiety of the fusion protein and (2) secretion of cytokines eliminating antigen-negative tumor cell variants.

In this review I suggest the hypothesis that similar plasticity occurs in mammals, where it may contribute to reward, memory, and their dysfunctions in several psychiatric disorders. In Aplysia, spontaneous release is enhanced by activation of presynaptic serotonin receptors, but presynaptic D1 dopamine receptors or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors could play a similar role in mammals. Those receptors enhance spontaneous release of glutamate in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area, and nucleus accumbens. In all of those brain areas, glutamate can activate postsynaptic receptors to elevate Ca(2+) and engage mechanisms of early-phase long-term potentiation (LTP), including AMPA receptor insertion, and of late-phase LTP, including protein synthesis and growth. Thus, presynaptic receptors and spontaneous release may contribute to postsynaptic mechanisms of plasticity in brain regions involved in reward and memory, and could play roles in disorders that affect plasticity in those regions, including addiction, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aplysia", "Brain", "Humans", "Memory", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Reward"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2013Sep18"}, {"PMID": "24028672", "Title": "Isolation of tumor antigen-specific single-chain variable fragments using a chimeric antigen receptor bicistronic retroviral vector in a Mammalian screening protocol.", "Abstract": "The clinical potential of chimeric antigen receptors in adoptive cellular therapy is beginning to be realized with several recent clinical trials targeting CD19 showing promising results in advanced B cell malignancies. This increased efficacy corresponds with improved engineering of the chimeric receptors with the latest-generation receptors eliciting greater signaling and proliferation potential. However, the antigen-binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain of the receptors is critical in determining the activity of the chimeric receptor-expressing T cells, as this determines specificity and affinity to the tumor antigen. In this study, we describe a mammalian T cell line screening protocol employing a 2A-based bicistronic retroviral vector to isolate functional scFvs. This approach involves expression of the scFv library in a chimeric antigen receptor, and is based on selection of clones capable of stimulating CD69 upregulation in a T cell line and has a number of advantages over previously described methods in that the use of a 2A cassette ensures the exclusion of nonexpressing scFvs and the screening using a chimeric receptor in a mammalian T cell line ensures selection in the optimum context for therapeutic use. Proof-of-principle experiments show that the protocol was capable of a 10(5)-fold enrichment of positive clones after three rounds of selection. Furthermore, an antigen-specific clone was successfully isolated from a partially enriched scFv library, confirming the strength of the protocol.

However, commonly used retroviral vector-based genetic modification requires T cells to be driven into cell division; this potent mitogenic stimulus is associated with the development of an effector phenotype that may adversely impact upon the long-term engraftment potential and subsequent antitumor effects of T cells. To investigate whether the cytokines used during culture impact upon the engraftment potential of gene-modified T cells, a humanized model employing T cells engrafted with a MART-1-specific T cell receptor adoptively transferred into NOD/Shi-scid IL-2r\u03b3(-/-) (NSG) immune-deficient mice bearing established melanoma tumors was used to compare the effects of the common \u03b3 chain cytokines IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 upon gene-modified T cell activity. MART-1-specific T cells cultured in IL-7 and IL-15 demonstrated greater relative in vitro proliferation and viability of T cells compared with the extensively used IL-2. Moreover, the IL-15 culture prolonged the survival of animals bearing melanoma tumors after adoptive transfer. However, the combination of IL-7 and IL-15 produced T cells with improved engraftment potential compared with IL-15 alone; however, a high rate of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease prevented the identification of a clear improvement in antitumor effect of these T cells. These results clearly demonstrate modulation of gene-modified T cell engraftment in the NSG mouse, which supports the future testing of the combination of IL-7 and IL-15 in adoptive cell therapy protocols; however, this improved engraftment is also associated with the long-term maintenance of xenoreactive T cells, which limits the ultimate usefulness of the NSG mouse model in this situation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Interleukins", "MART-1 Antigen", "Melanoma", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Models, Animal", "Skin Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocytes", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erik M", "Last Name": "Alcantar-Orozco", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Experimental Immunotherapy Group, Department of Medical Oncology, The Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, The University of Manchester , Manchester M20 4BX, United Kingdom ."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Gornall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vania", "Last Name": "Baldan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Gilham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human gene therapy methods", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23867222", "Title": "Clinical trials of health information technology interventions intended for patient use: unique issues and considerations.", "Abstract": "Despite the proliferation of health information technology (IT) interventions, descriptions of the unique considerations for conducting randomized trials of health IT interventions intended for patient use are lacking.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Attitude to Computers", "Computers, Handheld", "Humans", "Lung Transplantation", "Medical Informatics", "Mobile Applications", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Self Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "DeVito Dabbs", "Affiliation": "aSchool of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mi-Kyung", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brad", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jill", "Last Name": "Aubrecht", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Begey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruosha", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Pilewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian A", "Last Name": "Bermudez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary Amanda", "Last Name": "Dew", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical trials (London, England)", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23798619", "Title": "Reference interval studies: what is the maximum number of samples recommended?", "Abstract": "Little attention has been paid to the maximum number of specimens for reference interval calculation, i.e., the number of specimens beyond which there is no further benefit in reference interval calculation.
