We describe the physiological outcomes of perinatal underfeeding and overfeeding and explore potential mechanisms that may mediate the impact of such exposures on the development of feeding circuits within the CNS-including the influences of metabolic hormones and epigenetic changes. The perinatal environment, reflective of maternal nutritional status, contributes to the programming of offspring adiposity. The in utero and early postnatal periods represent critically sensitive developmental windows during which the hormonal and metabolic milieu affects the maturation of the hypothalamus. Maternal hyperglycemia is associated with increased transfer of glucose to the fetus driving fetal hyperinsulinemia. Elevated fetal insulin causes increased adiposity and consequently higher fetal circulating leptin concentration. Mechanistic studies in animal models indicate important roles of leptin and insulin in central and peripheral programming of adiposity, and suggest that optimal concentrations of these hormones are critical during early life. Additionally, the environmental milieu during development may be conveyed to progeny through epigenetic marks and these can potentially be vertically transmitted to subsequent generations. Thus, nutritional and metabolic/endocrine signals during perinatal development can have lifelong (and possibly multigenerational) impacts on offspring body weight regulation.", "Keywords": ["adiposity", "developmental programming", "epigenetics", "hypothalamus", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Leptin", "Adiposity", "Obesity", "Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Insulin", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alicja A", "Last Name": "Skowronski", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles A", "Last Name": "LeDuc", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Endocrine reviews", "PubDate": "2024Mar04"}, {"PMID": "37865656", "Title": "Rare predicted loss of function alleles in Bassoon (BSN) are associated with obesity.", "Abstract": "Bassoon (BSN) is a component of a hetero-dimeric presynaptic cytomatrix protein that orchestrates neurotransmitter release with Piccolo (PCLO) from glutamatergic neurons throughout the brain.

Genetic susceptibility and increased availability of energy-dense food are known risk factors for obesity. However, the extent to which these factors jointly bias behavior and neural circuitry towards increased adiposity in children remains unclear. While undergoing fMRI, 108 children (ages 5-11y) performed a food-specific go/no-go task. Participants were instructed to either respond (\"go\") or inhibit responding (\"no-go\") to images of food or toys. Half of the runs depicted high-calorie foods (e.g., pizza) whereas the other half depicted low-calorie foods (e.g., salad). Children were also genotyped for a DNA polymorphism associated with energy intake and obesity (FTO rs9939609) to examine the influence of obesity risk on behavioral and brain responses to food. Participants demonstrated differences in behavioral sensitivity to high- and low-calorie food images depending on task demands. Participants were slower but more accurate at detecting high- (relative to low-) calorie foods when responding to a neutral stimulus (i.e., toys) and worse at detecting toys when responding to high-calorie foods. Inhibition failures were accompanied by salience network activity (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), which was driven by false alarms to food images. Children at a greater genetic risk for obesity (dose-dependent model of the FTO genotype) demonstrated pronounced brain and behavioral relationships such that genetic risk was associated with heightened sensitivity to high-calorie food images and increased anterior insula activity. These findings suggest that high-calorie foods may be particularly salient to children at risk for developing eating habits that promote obesity.", "Keywords": ["Food cues", "Go/no-go", "Obesity risk", "Salience network", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Child", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Cues", "Obesity", "Feeding Behavior", "Neuroimaging", "Food", "Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kristina M", "Last Name": "Rapuano", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. kristina.rapuano@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Link", "Last Name": "Tejavibulya", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eda Naz", "Last Name": "Dinc", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anfei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haley", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Korn", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "B Timothy", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Ranzenhofer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "B J", "Last Name": "Casey", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laurel", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain imaging and behavior", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "36882962", "Title": "Technologies, strategies, and cautions when deconvoluting genome-wide association signals: FTO in focus.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have revealed a plethora of genetic variants that correlate with polygenic conditions.

Given its role governing key traits, such as body weight and reproductive timing, understanding the genetic regulation of hypothalamic development and function could yield insights into disease pathogenesis. However, given its inaccessibility, studying human hypothalamic gene regulation has proven challenging. To address this gap, we generate a high-resolution chromatin architecture atlas of an established embryonic stem cell derived hypothalamic-like neuron model across three stages of in vitro differentiation. We profile accessible chromatin and identify physical contacts between gene promoters and putative cis-regulatory elements to characterize global regulatory landscape changes during hypothalamic differentiation. Next, we integrate these data with GWAS loci for various complex traits, identifying multiple candidate effector genes. Our results reveal common target genes for these traits, potentially affecting core developmental pathways. Our atlas will enable future efforts to determine hypothalamic mechanisms influencing disease susceptibility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Chromosome

To investigate the molecular basis of obesity in human BBS, we developed a cellular model of BBS using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) hypothalamic arcuate-like neurons. BBS mutations BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 did not affect neuronal differentiation efficiency but caused morphological defects, including impaired neurite outgrowth and longer primary cilia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of BBS1M390R hypothalamic neurons identified several downregulated pathways, including insulin and cAMP signaling and axon guidance. Additional studies demonstrated that BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 mutations impaired insulin signaling in both human fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons. Overexpression of intact BBS10 fully restored insulin signaling by restoring insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in BBS10C91fsX95 neurons. Moreover, mutations in BBS1 and BBS10 impaired leptin-mediated p-STAT3 activation in iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons. Correction of the BBS mutation by CRISPR rescued leptin signaling.

We conducted retrospective analyses of three GIANT BMI GWAS efforts using ATAC-seq and promoter-focused Capture C data from human adipocytes and embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived hypothalamic-like neurons. This approach, with its extremely low false-positive rate, identified 15 loci at p<5\u00d710-5 in the 2010 GWAS, of which 13 achieved genome-wide significance by 2018, including at NAV1, MTIF3, and ADCY3. Eighty percent of constrained 2015 loci achieved genome-wide significance in 2018. We observed similar results in waist-to-hip ratio analyses.

Rare LEP mutations associated with congenital leptin deficiency cause severe early-onset obesity that can be mitigated by administering leptin. However, the role of genetic regulation of leptin in polygenic obesity remains poorly understood. We performed an exome-based analysis in up to 57,232 individuals of diverse ancestries to identify genetic variants that influence adiposity-adjusted leptin concentrations. We identify five novel variants, including four missense variants, in LEP, ZNF800, KLHL31, and ACTL9, and one intergenic variant near KLF14. The missense variant Val94Met (rs17151919) in LEP was common in individuals of African ancestry only, and its association with lower leptin concentrations was specific to this ancestry (P = 2 \u00d7 10-16, n = 3,901). Using in vitro analyses, we show that the Met94 allele decreases leptin secretion. We also show that the Met94 allele is associated with higher BMI in young African-ancestry children but not in adults, suggesting that leptin regulates early adiposity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

The clinical phenotypes of PWS suggest impaired hypothalamic neuroendocrine function; however, the exact cellular defects are unknown. Here, we report deficits in secretory granule (SG) abundance and bioactive neuropeptide production upon loss of MAGEL2 in humans and mice. Unbiased proteomic analysis of Magel2p\u0394/m+ mice revealed a reduction in components of SG in the hypothalamus that was confirmed in 2 PWS patient-derived neuronal cell models. Mechanistically, we show that proper endosomal trafficking by the MAGEL2-regulated WASH complex is required to prevent aberrant lysosomal degradation of SG proteins and reduction of mature SG abundance. Importantly, loss of MAGEL2 in mice, NGN2-induced neurons, and human patients led to reduced neuropeptide production. Thus, MAGEL2 plays an important role in hypothalamic neuroendocrine function, and cellular defects in this pathway may contribute to PWS disease etiology.

The timing and neuromolecular mechanisms for these effects are relevant to the prevention and treatment of obesity. Factors implicated in a body weight \"set point\" including dietary fat, circulating leptin, and other adipokines tend to covary with adiposity and are difficult to disarticulate experimentally. To dissociate leptin effects from adiposity and diet, we created a transgenic mouse in which leptin expression is regulated by doxycycline exposure. Using this system, we investigated the physiological consequences of developmentally-timed transient hyperleptinemia on subsequent adiposity. We evaluated physiological effects of leptin elevation during adulthood (9 to 29 weeks old), \"adolescence\" (3 to 8 weeks old), and the immediate postnatal period [postnatal days 0 to 22 (P0 to P22)] on long-term adiposity and susceptibility to gain weight on high-fat diet (HFD) fed ad libitum. We found that inducing chronic hyperleptinemia in adult or \"adolescent\" mice did not alter body weight when excess leptin was discontinued, and upon later exposure to HFD, weight gain did not differ from controls. However, transient elevation of circulating leptin from P0 to P22 increased weight and fat gain in response to HFD, indicating greater susceptibility to obesity as adults. Thus, transient plasma leptin elevations-mimicking one aspect of transient adiposity-increased later susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, although these effects were restricted to a critical developmental (P0 to P22) time window.

We hypothesized that increased abundance of nitrate-reducing oral bacteria would be associated with lower levels of cardiometabolic risk cross-sectionally. Methods and Results ORIGINS (Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance, and Insulin Resistance Study) enrolled 300 diabetes mellitus-free adults aged 20 to 55\u00a0years (mean=34\u00b110 years) (78% women). Microbial DNA was extracted from subgingival dental plaque (n=281) and V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to measure the relative abundances of 20 a priori-selected taxa with nitrate-reducing capacity. Standardized scores of each taxon's relative abundance were summed, producing a nitrate-reducing taxa summary score (NO3TSS) for each participant. Natural log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, plasma glucose, systolic BP, and diastolic BP were regressed on NO3TSS in multivariable linear regressions; prediabetes mellitus and hypertension prevalence were regressed on NO3TSS using modified Poisson regression models. Nitrate-reducing bacterial species represented 20\u00b116% of all measured taxa.

This process is triggered, in part, by specific (aa 9-23) epitopes of the insulin \u0392 chain. Previously, fish insulins were used clinically in patients allergic to bovine or porcine insulin. Fish and human insulin differ by two amino acids in the critical immunogenic region (aa 9-23) of the B chain. We hypothesized that \u03b2 cells synthesizing fish insulin would be less immunogenic in a mouse model of T1D. Transgenic NOD mice in which Greater Amberjack fish (Seriola dumerili) insulin was substituted for the insulin 2 gene were generated (mouse Ins1-/- mouse Ins2-/- fish Ins2+/+). In these mice, pancreatic islets remained free of autoimmune attack. To determine whether such reduction in immunogenicity is sufficient to protect \u03b2 cells from autoimmunity upon transplantation, we transplanted fish Ins2 transgenic (expressing solely Seriola dumerili Ins2), NOD, or B16:A-dKO islets under the kidney capsules of 5 weeks old female NOD wildtype mice. The B:Y16A \u0392 chain substitution has been previously shown to be protective of T1D in NOD mice. NOD mice receiving Seriola dumerili transgenic islet transplants showed a significant (p\u2009=\u20090.004) prolongation of their euglycemic period (by 6 weeks; up to 18 weeks of age) compared to un-manipulated female NOD (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age) and those receiving B16:A-dKO islet transplants (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age). These data support the concept that specific amino acid sequence modifications can reduce insulin immunogenicity. Additionally, our study shows that alteration of a single epitope is not sufficient to halt an ongoing autoimmune response. Which, and how many, T cell epitopes are required and suffice to perpetuate autoimmunity is currently unknown. Such studies may be useful to achieve host tolerance to \u03b2 cells by inactivating key immunogenic epitopes of stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells intended for transplantation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Here, we show by congenital and adult-onset Rpgrip1l deletion in Pomc-expressing neurons that the hyperphagia and obesity are likely due to neurodevelopmental effects that are characterized by a reduction in the Pomc/Neuropeptide Y (Npy) neuronal number ratio and marked increases in arcuate hypothalamic-paraventricular hypothalamic (ARH-PVH) axonal projections.

Isogenic human ARH-like embryonic stem cell-derived (ESc-derived) neurons homozygous for the obesity-risk alleles at rs8050136 or rs1421085 have decreased RPGRIP1L expression and have lower numbers of POMC neurons.

We employed in vitro adipogenesis models to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Fto affects adipocyte development and function. Fto expression was upregulated during adipogenesis, and was required for the maintenance of CEBPB and Cebpd/CEBPD expression in murine and human adipocytes in vitro. Fto knockdown decreased the number of 3T3-L1 cells that differentiated into adipocytes as well as the amount of lipid per mature adipocyte.

In the present study we investigated hepatic biochemical and anatomic phenotypes of Cre-mediated Ildr2 knock-out mice. Liver-specific Ildr2 knock-out mice were generated in C57BL/6J mice segregating for a floxed (exon 1) allele of Ildr2, using congenital and acute (10-13-week-old male mice) Cre expression. In addition, Ildr2 shRNA was administered to Ildr2 knock-out mice to test the effects of Ildr2 shRNA, per se, in the absence of Ildr2 expression. RNA sequencing was performed on livers of these knockdown and knockout mice. Congenital and acute liver-specific and hepatocyte-specific knockout mice did not develop hepatic steatosis. However, administration of Ildr2 shRNA to Ildr2 knock-out mice did cause hepatic steatosis, indicating that the Ildr2 shRNA had apparent \"off-target\" effects on gene(s) other than Ildr2. RNA sequencing and BLAST sequence alignment revealed Dgka as a candidate gene mediating these \"off-target\" effects. Ildr2 shRNA is 63% homologous to the Dgka gene, and Dgka expression decreased only in mice displaying hepatic steatosis. Dgka encodes diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) alpha, one of a family of DGKs which convert diacylglycerides to phosphatidic acid for second messenger signaling. Dgka knockdown mice would be expected to accumulate diacylglyceride, contributing to the observed hepatic steatosis. We conclude that ILDR2 plays a negligible role in hepatic steatosis.

Knockout of Rpgrip1l in mature adipocytes using Adipoq-Cre did not increase adiposity in mice that were fed chow or a high-fat diet. We also did not observe any effects of Rpgrip1l knockdown in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

We included evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess current knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying excess body-fat accumulation, the biological defense of excess fat mass, and the tendency for lost weight to be regained. A major area of emphasis is the science of energy homeostasis, the biological process that maintains weight stability by actively matching energy intake to energy expenditure over time. Growing evidence suggests that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight. We need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this \"upward setting\" or \"resetting\" of the defended level of body-fat mass, whether inherited or acquired. The ongoing study of how genetic, developmental, and environmental forces affect the energy homeostasis system will help us better understand these mechanisms and are therefore a major focus of this statement. The scientific goal is to elucidate obesity pathogenesis so as to better inform treatment, public policy, advocacy, and awareness of obesity in ways that ultimately diminish its public health and economic consequences.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Endocrinology", "Humans", "Obesity", "Societies, Medical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Diabetes Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109."}, {"First Name": "Randy J", "Last Name": "Seeley", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109."}, {"First Name": "Lori M", "Last Name": "Zeltser", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Drewnowski", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health Nutrition, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Ravussin", "Affiliation": "John S.

These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine

The livers of ob/ob mice in which Ildr2 is transiently overexpressed are relieved of hepatic steatosis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which ILDR2 affects these changes in hepatic lipid metabolism remain unknown. This study aimed to identify ILDR2-interacting proteins to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of ILDR2 in lipid homeostasis. We purified ILDR2-containing protein complexes using tandem affinity purification tagging and identified ZNF70, a member of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, as a novel ILDR2-interacting protein. We demonstrated that ZNF70 interacts with ZFP64 and activates HES1 transcription by binding to the HES1 promoter. In addition, HES1 gene expression is increased in ILDR2-knockdown HepG2 cells, in which ZNF70 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, suggesting that ZNF70 migration to the nucleus after dissociating from the ILDR2-ZNF70 complex activates HES1 transcription.

Previous studies have suggested that the obesity-risk allele rs8050136 in the first intron of FTO alters a regulatory element recognized by the transcription factor CUX1, thereby leading to decreased expression of FTO and retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like (RPGRIP1L). Here, we evaluated the effects of rs8050136 and another potential CUX1 element in rs1421085 on expression of nearby genes in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) neurons. There were allele-dosage effects on FTO, RPGRIP1L, and AKT-interacting protein (AKTIP) expression, but expression of other vicinal genes, including IRX3, IRX5, and RBL2, which have been implicated in mediating functional effects, was not altered. In vivo manipulation of CUX1, Fto, and/or Rpgrip1l expression in mice affected adiposity in a manner that was consistent with CUX1 influence on adiposity via remote effects on Fto and Rpgrip1l expression. In support of a mechanism, mice hypomorphic for Rpgrip1l exhibited hyperphagic obesity, as the result of diminished leptin sensitivity in Leprb-expressing neurons.

Although rare mutations in the leptin (LEP) gene are well known to cause leptin deficiency and severe obesity, no common loci regulating circulating leptin levels have been uncovered. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating leptin levels from 32,161 individuals and followed up loci reaching P<10(-6) in 19,979 additional individuals. We identify five loci robustly associated (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)) with leptin levels in/near LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL1 and FTO. Although the association of the FTO obesity locus with leptin levels is abolished by adjustment for BMI, associations of the four other loci are independent of adiposity. The GCKR locus was found associated with multiple metabolic traits in previous GWAS and the CCNL1 locus with birth weight. Knockdown experiments in mouse adipose tissue explants show convincing evidence for adipogenin, a regulator of adipocyte differentiation, as the novel causal gene in the SLC32A1 locus influencing leptin levels.

This study characterized leptin, POMC, and AgRP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 47 healthy human subjects, 23 lean and 24 overweight/obese (OW/OB), as related to BMI, adiposity, plasma leptin, soluble leptin receptor (s-OB-R), and insulin. POMC was measured since the POMC prohormone is the predominant POMC peptide in CSF and correlates with hypothalamic POMC in rodents. Plasma AgRP was similarly characterized. CSF leptin was 83-fold lower than in plasma and correlated strongly with BMI, body fat, and insulin. The relative amount of leptin transported into CSF declined with increasing BMI, ranging from 4.5 to 0.52%, consistent with a saturable transport mechanism. CSF sOB-R was 78-fold lower than in plasma and correlated negatively with plasma and CSF leptin. CSF POMC was higher in lean vs. OW/OB subjects (P < 0.001) and correlated negatively with CSF leptin (r = -0.60, P < 0.001) and with plasma leptin, insulin, BMI, and adiposity. CSF AgRP was not different in lean vs. OW/OB; however, plasma AgRP was higher in lean subjects (P = 0.001) and correlated negatively with BMI, adiposity, leptin, insulin, and HOMA (P < 0.005). Thus, CSF measurements may provide useful biomarkers for brain leptin and POMC activity. The striking negative correlation between CSF leptin and POMC could be secondary to leptin resistance and/or neuronal changes associated with obesity but may also indicate that POMC plays a primary role in regulating body weight and adiposity.

Here, we developed a protocol for efficient generation of hypothalamic neurons from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from patients with monogenetic forms of obesity. Combined early activation of sonic hedgehog signaling followed by timed NOTCH inhibition in human ESCs/iPSCs resulted in efficient conversion into hypothalamic NKX2.1+ precursors. Application of a NOTCH inhibitor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) further directed the cells into arcuate nucleus hypothalamic-like neurons that express hypothalamic neuron markers proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), somatostatin, and dopamine. These hypothalamic-like neurons accounted for over 90% of differentiated cells and exhibited transcriptional profiles defined by a hypothalamic-specific gene expression signature that lacked pituitary markers. Importantly, these cells displayed hypothalamic neuron characteristics, including production and secretion of neuropeptides and increased p-AKT and p-STAT3 in response to insulin and leptin.

In weight-reduced humans, these phenotypes together with pronounced hypometabolism and increased parasympathetic nervous system tone create the optimal circumstance for weight regain. Based on the weight loss induced by leptin administration in states of leptin deficiency (obese) and observed similarity of phenotypes in states of congenital and dietary-induced states of hypoleptinemia (reduced obese), it has been suggested that exogenous leptin could potentially be useful in initiating, promoting, and sustaining weight reduction. However, the responses of human beings to exogenous leptin administration are dependent not only on extant energy stores but also on energy balance. Leptin administration to humans at usual weight has little, if any, effect on body weight while leptin administration during weight loss mitigates hunger, especially if given in supraphysiological doses during severe caloric restriction. Leptin repletion is most effective following weight loss by dietary restriction. In this state of weight stability but reduced energy stores, leptin at least partially reverses many of the metabolic, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral adaptations that favor weight regain.

Although methods to induce pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by transcription factors are widely used in basic research, numerous differences between induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been reported, potentially affecting their clinical use. Because of the therapeutic potential of diploid embryonic stem-cell lines derived from adult cells of diseased human subjects, we have systematically investigated the parameters affecting efficiency of blastocyst development and stem-cell derivation. Here we show that improvements to the oocyte activation protocol, including the use of both kinase and translation inhibitors, and cell culture in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitors, promote development to the blastocyst stage. Developmental efficiency varied between oocyte donors, and was inversely related to the number of days of hormonal stimulation required for oocyte maturation, whereas the daily dose of gonadotropin or the total number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved did not affect developmental outcome. Because the use of concentrated Sendai virus for cell fusion induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, causing premature oocyte activation, we used diluted Sendai virus in calcium-free medium.

We used adenovirus vectors that express shRNA or are driven by the CMV promoter, respectively, to knockdown or overexpress Ildr2 in livers of wild type and ob/ob mice. Livers in knockdown mice were steatotic, with increased hepatic and circulating triglycerides and total cholesterol. Increased circulating VLDL, without reduction in triglyceride clearance suggests an effect of reduced hepatic ILDR2 on hepatic cholesterol clearance. In animals that overexpress Ildr2, hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were reduced, and strikingly so in ob/ob mice. There were no significant changes in body weight, energy expenditure or glucose/insulin homeostasis in knockdown or overexpressing mice. Knockdown mice showed reduced expression of genes mediating synthesis and oxidation of hepatic lipids, suggesting secondary suppression in response to increased hepatic lipid content. In Ildr2-overexpressing ob/ob mice, in association with reduced liver fat content, levels of transcripts related to neutral lipid synthesis and cholesterol were increased, suggesting \"relief\" of the secondary suppression imposed by lipid accumulation. Considering the fixed location of ILDR2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, we investigated the possible participation of ILDR2 in ER stress responses. In general, Ildr2 overexpression was associated with increases, and knockdown with decreases in levels of expression of molecular components of canonical ER stress pathways.

Our results demonstrate that iPSC-derived \u03b2 cells reflect \u03b2 cell-autonomous phenotypes of MODY2 subjects, providing a platform for mechanistic analysis of specific genotypes on \u03b2 cell function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Base Sequence", "Case-Control Studies", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Glucokinase", "Glucose", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Insulin", "Insulin Secretion", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Urocortins", "Zinc Transporter 8"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haiqing", "Last Name": "Hua", "Affiliation": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linshan", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hector", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Freeby", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary Pat", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Ludwig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liyong", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Greenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Leduc", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Goland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23616257", "Title": "Whole-exome sequencing identifies novel LEPR mutations in individuals with severe early onset obesity.", "Abstract": "Obesity is a major public health problem that increases the risk for a broad spectrum of co-morbid conditions.
