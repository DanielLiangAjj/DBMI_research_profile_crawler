[{"PMID": "38854018", "Title": "Ion channel inhibition by targeted recruitment of NEDD4-2 with divalent nanobodies.", "Abstract": "Targeted recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases to degrade traditionally undruggable proteins is a disruptive paradigm for developing new therapeutics. Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. Recruiting endogenous NEDD4-2 to diverse ion channel proteins (KCNQ1, ENaC, and CaV2.2) using a divalent (DiVa) nanobody format strongly reduced their functional expression with minimal off-target effects as assessed by global proteomics, compared to simple NEDD4-2 overexpression. The results establish utility of a HECT E3 ligase for targeted protein downregulation, validate a class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins as susceptible to this modality, and introduce endogenous E3 ligase recruitment with DiVa nanobodies as a general method to generate novel genetically-encoded ion channel inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Travis J", "Last Name": "Morgenstern", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Arden", "Last Name": "Darko-Boateng", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Afriyie", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sri Karthika", "Last Name": "Shanmugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Xinle", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Papiya", "Last Name": "Choudhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Meera", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "The Potomac School, McLean, VA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May31"}, {"PMID": "38227371", "Title": "A membrane-associated phosphoswitch in Rad controls adrenergic regulation of cardiac calcium channels.", "Abstract": "The ability to fight or flee from a threat relies on an acute adrenergic surge that augments cardiac output, which is dependent on increased cardiac contractility and heart rate.

During exercise or fright, IKs is up-regulated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Q1 phosphorylation to maintain heart rhythm and optimum cardiac performance. Sympathetic up-regulation of IKs requires recruitment of PKA holoenzyme (two regulatory - RI or RII - and two catalytic C\u03b1 subunits) to Q1 C-terminus by an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP9). Mutations in Q1 or AKAP9 that abolish their functional interaction result in long QT syndrome type 1 and 11, respectively, which increases the risk of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Here, we investigated the utility of a targeted protein phosphorylation (TPP) approach to reconstitute PKA regulation of IKs in the absence of AKAP9. Targeted recruitment of endogenous C\u03b1 to E1-YFP using a GFP/YFP nanobody (nano) fused to RII\u03b1 enabled acute cAMP-mediated enhancement of IKs, reconstituting physiological regulation of the channel complex. By contrast, nano-mediated tethering of RII\u03b1 or C\u03b1 to Q1-YFP constitutively inhibited IKs by retaining the channel intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Proteomic analysis revealed that distinct phosphorylation sites are modified by C\u03b1 targeted to Q1-YFP compared to free C\u03b1. Thus, functional outcomes of synthetically recruited PKA on IKs regulation is critically dependent on the site of recruitment within the channel complex.

The results introduce an original method for probing distinctive functions of ion channel auxiliary subunit isoforms, reveal additional dimensions of CaV\u03b21 signaling in neurons, and describe a genetically-encoded HVACC inhibitor with unique properties.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium Channels", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Neurons", "src Homology Domains", "Protein Isoforms", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Calcium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Travis J", "Last Name": "Morgenstern", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neha", "Last Name": "Nirwan", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erick O", "Last Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Ochoa", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hugo", "Last Name": "Bibollet", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Papiya", "Last Name": "Choudhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yianni D", "Last Name": "Laloudakis", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger A", "Last Name": "Bannister", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin F", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel L", "Last Name": "Minor", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. hc2405@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2022Dec09"}, {"PMID": "36424916", "Title": "Rad regulation of CaV1.2 channels controls cardiac fight-or-flight response.", "Abstract": "Fight-or-flight responses involve \u03b2-adrenergic-induced increases in heart rate and contractile force.

Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice.

A frequent cause for LQTS is mutations in the KCNH2 gene (also known as the human ether-a-go-go-related gene or hERG), which reduce or modulate the potassium current IKr and hence alter cardiac repolarization. In a patient with a clinically diagnosed LQTS, we identified the mutation L69P in the N-terminal PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain of hERG. Functional expression in HEK293 cells shows that a homotetrameric hERG channel reconstituted with only mutant subunits exhibits a drastically reduced surface expression of the channel protein thus leading to a diminished hERG current. Unlike many other mutations in the hERG-PAS domain the negative impact of the L69P substitution cannot be rescued by facilitated protein folding at a lower incubation temperature. Further, co-expression of wt and mutant monomers does not restore either wt like surface expression or the full hERG current. These results indicate L69P is a dominant negative mutation, with deficits which most likely occurs at the level of protein folding and subsequently inhibits trafficking to the plasma membrane.

Modulation of CaV 1/CaV 2 channel activity is a powerful mechanism to regulate physiology, and there are a host of intracellular signalling molecules that tune different aspects of CaV channel trafficking and gating for this purpose. Beyond normal physiological regulation, the diverse CaV channel modulatory mechanisms may potentially be co-opted or interfered with for therapeutic benefits. CaV 1/CaV 2 channels are potently inhibited by a four-member sub-family of Ras-like GTPases known as RGK (Rad, Rem, Rem2, Gem/Kir) proteins. Understanding the mechanisms by which RGK proteins inhibit CaV 1/CaV 2 channels has led to the development of novel genetically encoded CaV channel blockers with unique properties; including, chemo- and optogenetic control of channel activity, and blocking channels either on the basis of their subcellular localization or by targeting an auxiliary subunit.

Neuronal CaV1/CaV2 channels are composed of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b12\u03b4 subunits. The \u03b2 subunits of CaV channels are cytoplasmic proteins that increase the surface expression of the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit of CaV. We targeted the high-affinity protein-protein interface of CaV\u03b2's pocket within the CaV\u03b1 subunit. Structure-based virtual screening of 50,000 small molecule library docked to the \u03b2 subunit led to the identification of 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-N-((4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methyl)acetamide (IPPQ). This small molecule bound to CaV\u03b2 and inhibited its coupling with N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV2.2) channels, leading to a reduction in CaV2.2 currents in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, decreased presynaptic localization of CaV2.2 in vivo, decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials and miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and inhibited release of the nociceptive neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide from spinal cord. IPPQ did not target opioid receptors nor did it engage inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor signaling.

One of the most prevalent hereditary LQTS subtypes, LQT2, results from loss-of-function mutations in the hERG channel, which conducts IKr, the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current, critical for cardiac repolarization. The majority of LQT2 mutations result in Class 2 deficits characterized by impaired maturation and trafficking of hERG channels. Here, we have developed a high-throughput flow cytometric assay to analyze the surface and total expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant hERG channels with single-cell resolution. To test our method, we focused on 16 LQT2 mutations in the hERG Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain that were previously studied via a widely used biochemical approach that compares levels of 135-kDa immature and 155-kDa fully glycosylated hERG protein to infer surface expression. We confirmed that LQT2 mutants expressed in HEK293 cells displayed a decreased surface density compared to WT hERG, and were differentially rescued by low temperature. However, we also uncovered some notable differences from the findings obtained via the biochemical approach. In particular, three mutations (N33T, R56Q, and A57P) with apparent WT-like hERG glycosylation patterns displayed up to 50% decreased surface expression. Furthermore, despite WT-like levels of complex glycosylation, these mutants have impaired forward trafficking, and exhibit varying half-lives at the cell surface. The results highlight utility of the surface labeling/flow cytometry approach to quantitatively assess trafficking deficiencies associated with LQT2 mutations, to discern underlying mechanisms, and to report on interventions that rescue deficits in hERG surface expression.", "Keywords": ["HERG channels (Kv11)", "cardiac arrhythmias", "flow cytometry", "ion channel trafficking", "long QT syndrome type 2"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ananya", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "29650545", "Title": "Regulation of Blood Pressure by Targeting CaV1.2-Galectin-1 Protein Interaction.", "Abstract": "L-type CaV1.2 channels play crucial roles in the regulation of blood pressure.

Increased cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been observed during sepsis, but the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities have not been determined. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation could be responsible for sepsis-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes with low concentrations of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Elevated mitochondrial superoxide was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial calcium overload. NOX2 inhibition decreased LPS-induced superoxide and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic ablation of NOX2 did not have LPS-induced superoxide or mitochondrial dysfunction. LPS decreased contractility and calcium transient amplitude in isolated cardiomyocytes, and these abnormalities were prevented by inhibition of NOX2. LPS decreased systolic function in mice, measured by echocardiography.

The theme of the 2016 symposium was 'K+ Channels and Regulation'. Experts in the field contributed their experimental and mathematical modelling perspectives and discussed emerging questions, controversies and challenges on the topic of cardiac K+ channels. This paper summarizes the topics of formal presentations and informal discussions from the symposium on the structural basis of voltage-gated K+ channel function, as well as the mechanisms involved in regulation of K+ channel gating, expression and membrane localization. Given the critical role for K+ channels in determining the rate of cardiac repolarization, it is hardly surprising that essentially every aspect of K+ channel function is exquisitely regulated in cardiac myocytes. This regulation is complex and highly interrelated to other aspects of myocardial function. K+ channel regulatory mechanisms alter, and are altered by, physiological challenges, pathophysiological conditions, and pharmacological agents. An accompanying paper focuses on the integrative role of K+ channels in cardiac electrophysiology, i.e. how K+ currents shape the cardiac action potential, and how their dysfunction can lead to arrhythmias, and discusses K+ channel-based therapeutics.

The abundance of this variant was gradually increased by 12.5-folds within 14 days of transverse aortic banding that induced cardiac hypertrophy in adult mouse hearts and was also elevated in left ventricles from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

In addition, the CaV1.2e21+22 variant interacted with CaV\u03b2 subunits significantly more than wild-type CaV1.2 channels, and competition of CaV\u03b2 subunits by CaV1.2e21+22 consequently enhanced ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the wild-type CaV1.2 channels.

This deleterious effect is poorly understood, and thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive.

Peripherally, Flx has anti-resorptive properties, directly impairing osteoclast differentiation and function through a serotonin-reuptake-independent mechanism that is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ levels and the transcription factor Nfatc1. With time, however, Flx also triggers a brain-serotonin-dependent rise in sympathetic output that increases bone resorption sufficiently to counteract its local anti-resorptive effect, thus leading to a net effect of impaired bone formation and bone loss. Accordingly, neutralizing this second mode of action through co-treatment with the \u03b2-blocker propranolol, while leaving the peripheral effect intact, prevents Flx-induced bone loss in mice.

Understanding how RGK proteins inhibit CaV channels is important for perspectives on their (patho)physiological roles and could advance their development and use as genetically-encoded CaV channel blockers. We previously reported that Rem can block surface CaV1.2 channels in 2 independent ways that engage distinct components of the channel complex: (1) by binding auxiliary \u03b2 subunits (\u03b2-binding-dependent inhibition, or BBD); and (2) by binding the pore-forming \u03b11C subunit N-terminus (\u03b11C-binding-dependent inhibition, or ABD). By contrast, Gem uses only the BBD mechanism to block CaV1.2. Rem molecular determinants required for BBD CaV1.2 inhibition are the distal C-terminus and the guanine nucleotide binding G-domain which interact with the plasma membrane and CaV\u03b2, respectively. However, Rem determinants for ABD CaV1.2 inhibition are unknown. Here, combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer, electrophysiology, systematic truncations, and Rem/Gem chimeras we found that the same Rem distal C-terminus and G-domain also mediate ABD CaV1.2 inhibition, but with different interaction partners. Rem distal C-terminus interacts with \u03b11C N-terminus to anchor the G-domain which likely interacts with an as-yet-unidentified site. In contrast to some previous studies, neither the C-terminus of Rem nor Gem was sufficient to inhibit CaV1/CaV2 channels.

We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Inhibitors of PKC or NOX2 prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase in ROS, demonstrating that PKC-NOX2 activation is also required for amplification of palmitate induced-ROS. Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have palmitate-induced ROS or mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that palmitate induces mitochondrial ROS that is amplified by NOX2, causing greater mitochondrial ROS generation and partial depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Canonically, G-domains are key control modules, functioning as nucleotide-regulated switches of G-protein activity. Whether Rad and Rem G-domains conform to this canonical paradigm is ambiguous. Here, we used multiple functional measurements in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes (Ca(V)1.2 currents, Ca(2+) transients, Ca(V)\u03b2 binding) as biosensors to probe the role of the G-domain in regulation of Rad and Rem function.

Cytosolic Ca(2+) continuously cycles between ~100 nM and ~1 \u03bcM with each heartbeat due to Ca(2+) linked signalling from LTCCs to ryanodine receptors. This rapid cycling raises the question as to how cardiac myocytes distinguish the Ca(2+) fluxes originating through L-type channels that are dedicated to contraction from Ca(2+) fluxes originating from other L-type channels that are used for non-contraction-related signalling. In general, disparate Ca(2+) sources in cardiac myocytes such as current through differently localized LTCCs as well as from IP3 receptors can signal selectively to Ca(2+)-dependent effectors in local microdomains that can be impervious to the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) transients that drive contraction. A particular challenge for diversified signalling via cardiac LTCCs is that they are voltage-gated and, therefore, open and presumably flood their microdomains with Ca(2+) with each action potential. Thus spatial localization of Cav1.2 channels to different types of microdomains of the ventricular cardiomyocyte membrane as well as the existence of particular macromolecular complexes in each Cav1.2 microdomain are important to effect different types of Cav1.2 signalling. In this review we examine aspects of Cav1.2 structure, targeting and signalling in two specialized membrane microdomains--transverse tubules and caveolae.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Calmodulin", "Caveolae", "Humans", "Membrane Microdomains", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Protein Subunits", "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robin M", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cardiovascular research", "PubDate": "2013May01"}, {"PMID": "23063948", "Title": "Regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by RGK proteins.", "Abstract": "RGK proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of monomeric G-proteins, and currently include four members - Rad, Rem, Rem2, and Gem/Kir.
