The rVLPFC has been identified as an important structure in mediating cognitive affective states / feeling conscious states. The current study examined the involvement of the rVLPFC in mediating cognitive affective states in those predisposed to aberrant experiences in the neurotypical population. Participants completed two trait-based measures: (i) the Cortical Hyperexcitability Index_II (CHi_II, a proxy measure of cortical hyperexcitability) and (ii) two factors from the Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS). An optimised 7-channel MtDCS montage for stimulation conditions (Anodal, Cathodal and Sham) was created targeting the rVLPFC in a single-blind study. At the end of each stimulation session, participants completed a body-threat task (BTAB) while skin conductance responses (SCRs) and psychological responses were recorded. Participants with signs of increasing cortical hyperexcitability showed significant suppression of SCRs in the Cathodal stimulation relative to the Anodal and sSham conditions. Those high on the trait-based measures of depersonalisation-like experiences failed to show reliable effects. Collectively, the findings suggest that baseline brain states can mediate the effects of neurostimulation which would be missed via sample level averaging and without appropriate measures for stratifying individual differences.", "Keywords": ["Brain Stimulation", "Cortical hyperexcitability", "MtDCS", "rVLPFC"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Single-Blind Method", "Cerebral Cortex", "Emotions", "Disease Susceptibility", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shalmali D", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, LA1 4YF, UK.

One of the reasons for this gap is that good technical performance does not inevitably result in patient benefit. We advocate for a conceptual shift wherein AI tools are seen as components of an intervention ensemble. The intervention ensemble describes the constellation of practices that, together, bring about benefit to patients or health systems. Shifting from a narrow focus on the tool itself toward the intervention ensemble prioritizes a \"sociotechnical\" vision for translation of AI that values all components of use that support beneficial patient outcomes.

This study aimed to determine the neurophysiologic basis of immobilization-induced skeletal muscle decline, and whether repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) could prevent any decline. Twenty-four healthy young males (20 \u00b1 0.5 years) underwent unilateral limb immobilization for 72 h. Subjects were randomized between daily rTMS (n = 12) using six 20 Hz pulse trains of 1.5 s duration with a 60 s inter-train-interval delivered at 90% resting Motor Threshold (rMT), or Sham rTMS (n = 12) throughout immobilization. Maximal grip strength, EMG activity, arm volume, and composition were determined at 0 and 72 h. Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) were determined daily throughout immobilization to index motor excitability. Immobilization induced a significant reduction in motor excitability across time (-30% at 72 h; p < 0.05). The rTMS intervention increased motor excitability at 0 h (+13%, p < 0.05). Despite daily rTMS treatment, there was still a significant reduction in motor excitability (-33% at 72 h, p < 0.05), loss in EMG activity (-23.5% at 72 h; p < 0.05), and a loss of maximal grip strength (-22%, p < 0.001) after immobilization. Interestingly, the increase in biceps (Sham vs. rTMS) (+0.8 vs. +0.1 mm, p < 0.01) and posterior forearm (+0.3 vs. +0.0 mm, p < 0.05) skinfold thickness with immobilization in Sham treatment was not observed following rTMS treatment. Reduced MEPs drive the loss of strength with immobilization. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation cannot prevent this loss of strength but further investigation and optimization of neuroplasticity protocols may have therapeutic benefit.", "Keywords": ["MEPs", "immobilization", "muscle function", "plasticity", "rTMS"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Gaffney", "Affiliation": "Lancaster Medical School, Health Innovation One, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Amber", "Last Name": "Drinkwater", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Shalmali D", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "O'Hanlon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Abbie", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Kayle-Anne", "Last Name": "Sands", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Kate", "Last Name": "Slade", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Jason J", "Last Name": "Braithwaite", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Nuttall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33328054", "Title": "Ethical limitations of algorithmic fairness solutions in health care machine learning.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Health Equity", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Social Justice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa D", "Last Name": "McCradden", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioethics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.
