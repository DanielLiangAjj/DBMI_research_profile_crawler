The classic example of a sensitive period comes from studies of sensory systems, like the visual system, where early visual experience is required for normal wiring of primary visual cortex and proper visual functioning. At a mechanistic level, loss of incoming visual input results in a decrease in activity in thalamocortical neurons representing the affected eye, resulting in an activity-dependent reduction in the representation of those inputs in the visual cortex and loss of visual perception in that eye. While associative cortical regions like the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) do not receive direct sensory input, recent findings demonstrate that changes in activity levels experienced by this region during defined windows in early development may also result in long-lasting changes in prefrontal cortical circuitry, network function and behavior. For example, we recently demonstrated that decreasing the activity of mPFC parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons during a period of time encompassing peripuberty (postnatal day P14) to adolescence (P50) led to a long-lasting decrease in their functional inhibition of pyramidal cells, as well as impairments in cognitive flexibility. While the effects of manipulating mPFC PV interneuron activity were selective to development, and not adulthood, the exact timing of the sensitive period for this manipulation remains unknown.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriella M", "Last Name": "Sahyoun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Trang Dao", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Anqueira-Gonz\u00e0lez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ava", "Last Name": "Hornblass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Canetta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Developmental neuroscience", "PubDate": "2024Jun03"}, {"PMID": "38562790", "Title": "Adolescent Thalamocortical Inhibition Alters Prefrontal Excitation-Inhibition Balance.", "Abstract": "Adolescent inhibition of thalamo-cortical projections from postnatal day P20-50 leads to long lasting deficits in prefrontal cortex function and cognition in the adult mouse. While this suggests a role of thalamic activity in prefrontal cortex maturation, it is unclear how inhibition of these projections affects prefrontal circuit connectivity during adolescence. Here, we used chemogenetic tools to inhibit thalamo-prefrontal projections in the mouse from P20-35 and measured synaptic inputs to prefrontal pyramidal neurons by layer (either II/III or V/VI) and projection target twenty-four hours later using slice physiology. We found a decrease in the frequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents in layer II/III nucleus accumbens (NAc) and layer V/VI medio-dorsal thalamus projecting neurons while layer V/VI NAc-projecting neurons showed an increase in the amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Regarding cortical projections, the frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory currents was enhanced in contralateral mPFC-projecting neurons. Notably, despite these complex changes in individual levels of excitation and inhibition, the overall balance between excitation and inhibition in each cell was only changed in the contralateral mPFC projections. This finding suggests homeostatic regulation occurs within subcortically but not intracortical callosally-projecting neurons. Increased inhibition of intra-prefrontal connectivity may therefore be particularly important for prefrontal cortex circuit maturation.

One important aspect of reward seeking is 'wanting', which can be operationalized in both humans and rodents in tasks such as the progressive ratio, in which an increasing amount of work is required to earn a given reward. Importantly, many disorders with reward-seeking deficits are believed to have an important neurodevelopmental component, underscoring the importance of being able to study changes in motivation across the lifespan. Although this task has been adapted for both adult and adolescent rats, in mice it has predominantly been used to assay motivational changes in adults.

Toward that end, we now report a protocol for appropriate weight management in developing animals that require food restriction, and a protocol for behavioral shaping and progressive ratio testing in adolescent mice, including an assessment of whether the animals perform better with lever presses or nose pokes as the required operant response. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Most pharmacological agents available to treat these disorders target monoamine systems. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for an individual is a process of trial and error.

We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through agonism of the mu-opioid receptor instead of targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model. We found that C57BL/6J pups exposed to FLX from postnatal day 2 to 11 (PNFLX, the mouse equivalent in terms of brain development to the human third trimester) showed increased avoidant behaviors as adults that failed to improve, or were even exacerbated, by chronic SSRI treatment. By contrast, avoidant behaviors in these same mice were drastically improved following chronic treatment with TIA.

To address this, we utilized a dual wavelength optogenetic approach to stimulate MD and vHPC inputs onto single, genetically defined mPFC neuronal subtypes. Specifically, we compared the convergence and synaptic dynamics of both inputs onto mPFC pyramidal cells, and parvalbumin (PV)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons.

In maze tasks, mice navigate through the environment and require a significant amount of time to complete each trial, thereby limiting the number of trials that can be run per day.

Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in refining the formation of brain circuits during sensitive developmental periods. In rodents, the role of 5-HT1A receptors in general and autoreceptors in particular has been characterized in anxiety. However, less is known about the role of 5-HT1A receptors in depression-related behavior. Here, we show that whole-life suppression of heteroreceptor expression results in a broad depression-like behavioral phenotype accompanied by physiological and cellular changes within medial prefrontal cortex-dorsal raphe proper (mPFC-DRN) circuitry. These changes include increased basal 5-HT in a mPFC that is hyporesponsive to stress and decreased basal 5-HT levels and firing rates in a DRN hyperactivated by the same stressor. Remarkably, loss of heteroreceptors in the PFC at adolescence is sufficient to recapitulate this depression-like behavioral syndrome. Our results suggest that targeting mPFC 5-HT1A heteroreceptors during adolescence in humans may have lifelong ramifications for depression and its treatment.", "Keywords": ["5-HT(1A)", "DRN", "adolescence", "anxiety", "depression", "development", "mPFC", "serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["Affect", "Animals", "Anxiety", "Autoreceptors", "Behavior, Animal", "Depression", "Dorsal Raphe Nucleus", "Male", "Mice", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A", "Serotonin", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alvaro L", "Last Name": "Garcia-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo (ADL) Lab, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr., Box 87, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qingyuan", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo (ADL) Lab, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr., Box 87, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Canetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alain M", "Last Name": "Gardier", "Affiliation": "CESP, University Paris-Sud, Fac.
