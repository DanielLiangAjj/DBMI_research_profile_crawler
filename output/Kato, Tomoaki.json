[{"PMID": "38719378", "Title": "Intestinal Transplantation: Include the Spleen with Intestinal Graft?", "Abstract": "The traditional procedure for multivisceral transplant (MVT) is to transplant the stomach, pancreas, intestine, and liver en bloc. During surgery, the native spleen is routinely removed from the recipient, and it usually creates more space in the abdomen to insert the allogeneic graft. Thus, recipients often become asplenic after MVT.

Following intestinal transplantation (ITx), surveillance ileal mucosal biopsies provide a unique opportunity to map the dynamic establishment of gut lymphocyte populations. Using polychromatic flow cytometry that includes HLA allele group-specific mAbs distinguishing donor from recipient cells along with high throughput BCR sequencing, we tracked the establishment of recipient B cell populations and BCR repertoire in the allograft mucosa of ITx recipients. We confirm the early presence of na\u00efve donor B cells in the circulation and, for the first time, document the establishment of recipient B cell populations, including B resident memory cells, in the intestinal allograft mucosa. Recipient B cell repopulation of the allograft was most rapid in infant (<1 year old)-derived allografts and, unlike T cell repopulation, did not correlate with rejection rates. While recipient memory B cell populations were increased in graft mucosa compared to circulation, na\u00efve recipient B cells remained detectable in the graft mucosa for years. Comparisons of peripheral and intra-mucosal B cell repertoires in the absence of rejection revealed increased BCR mutation rates and clonal expansion in graft mucosa compared to circulating B cells, but these parameters did not increase markedly after the first year post-transplant. Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults. Collectively, our data demonstrate intestinal mucosal B cell repertoire establishment from a circulating pool, a process that continues for years without evidence of establishment of a stable mucosal

Most agents used clinically and inhibitors of oncogenes overexpressed in FLC showed little efficacy on PDX. A high-throughput functional drug screen found primary and metastatic FLC were vulnerable to clinically available inhibitors of TOPO1 and HDAC and to napabucasin. Napabucasin's efficacy was mediated through reactive oxygen species and inhibition of translation initiation, and specific inhibition of eIF4A was effective. The sensitivity of each PDX line inversely correlated with expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, and inhibition of Bcl-xL synergized with other drugs. Screening directly on cells dissociated from patient resections validated these results. This demonstrates that a direct functional screen on patient tumors provides therapeutically informative data within a clinically useful time frame. Identifying these novel therapeutic targets and combination therapies is an urgent need, as effective therapeutics for FLC are currently unavailable. SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutics informed by genomics have not yielded effective therapies for FLC. A functional screen identified TOPO1, HDAC inhibitors, and napabucasin as efficacious and synergistic with inhibition of Bcl-xL. Validation on cells dissociated directly from patient tumors demonstrates the ability for functional precision medicine in a solid tumor.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p.

humans receiving intestinal transplantation (ITx), long-term multilineage blood chimerism often develops. Donor T cell macrochimerism (\u22654%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism. These mechanisms suggest an approach to achieving intestinal allograft tolerance.", "Keywords": ["Immunology", "Organ transplantation", "T cells", "Tolerance", "Transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Allografts", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Humans", "Intestines", "Lymphopoiesis", "Male", "Organ Transplantation", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation Chimera"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Zuber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Brittany", "Last Name": "Shonts", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Aleksandar", "Last Name": "Obradovic", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Zicheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristjana", "Last Name": "Frangaj", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Wenzhao", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aaron M", "Last Name": "Rosenfeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth E", "Last Name": "Waffarn", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Liou", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Sai-Ping", "Last Name": "Lau", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Thomas M", "Last Name": "Savage", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Suxiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Kortney", "Last Name": "Rogers", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nichole M", "Last Name": "Danzl", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Shilpa", "Last Name": "Ravella", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Prakash", "Last Name": "Satwani", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Alina", "Last Name": "Iuga", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and."}, {"First Name": "Siu-Hong", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Griesemer", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eline T Luning", "Last Name": "Prak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Kato", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2021Apr15"}, {"PMID": "33630445", "Title": "Proposal of a New Comprehensive Notation for Hepatectomy: The \"New World\" Terminology.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Liver", "Terminology as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Masato", "Last Name": "Nagino", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "DeMatteo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Hauke", "Last Name": "Lang", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplant Surgery, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Cherqui", "Affiliation": "H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse, APHP -

Patients without cirrhosis with PVT suffer from presinusoidal portal hypertension, and often hepatic atrophy is a topic that has received little attention. We hypothesized that patients with PVT have decreased liver volumes, and shunts that preserve intrahepatic portal flow enhance liver regeneration. Sixty-four adult and pediatric patients with PVT who underwent surgical shunt placement between 1998 and 2011 were included in a retrospective study. Baseline liver volumes from adult patients were compared with standard liver volume (SLV) as well as a group of healthy controls undergoing evaluation for liver donation. Clinical assessment, liver function tests, and liver and spleen volumes from cross-sectional imaging were compared before and after surgery. A total of 40 patients received portal flow-preserving shunts (32 mesoportal and 8 selective splenorenal), whereas 24 received portal flow-diverting shunts (16 nonselective splenorenal and 8 mesocaval). Baseline adult liver volumes were 26% smaller than SLV (1248 versus 1624 cm3 ; P = 0.02) and 20% smaller than the control volumes (1248 versus 1552 cm3 ; P = 0.02). Baseline adult spleen volumes were larger compared with controls (1258 versus 229 cm3 ; P < 0.001). Preserving shunts were associated with significant increase in liver volumes (886 versus 1131 cm3 ; P = 0.01), whereas diverting shunts were not. Diverting shunts significantly improved splenomegaly. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that patients without cirrhosis with PVT have significant liver atrophy and splenomegaly.

Preoperative investigations revealed a large tumor with encasement of the origins of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and bilateral renal arteries. Initially, to prevent the need to explant the liver, the distal SMA (with takeoff of the replaced common hepatic artery) was anastomosed to the splenic artery.

We used 3 different techniques to perform 5 liver transplants in male cynomolgus macaques (weight, 7.4-10.8 kg; mismatched for MHC I and II; matched for ABO). In procedure A, we clamped the portal vein briefly, as in human transplants, as well as the superior mesentery artery to minimize congestion at the expense of temporary ischemia (n = 2). In procedure B, we performed a temporary portocaval shunt with extracorporeal venovenous bypass (n = 1). For procedure C, we developed an H-shunt system (modified portocaval shunt) with extracorporeal bypass (n = 2). Postoperative immunosuppression comprised cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Recipients in procedure A developed hemodynamic instability and were euthanized within 2 d. The recipient that underwent procedure B was euthanized within 11 d due to inferior vena caval thrombosis. The H-shunt in procedure C led to minimal PV congestion during the anhepatic phase, and both recipients reached the 21-d survival endpoint with good graft function.

In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections. Increased ratios of GvH to HvG clones were seen in non-rejectors, potentially mitigating the constant threat of rejection posed by HvG clones persisting within the tissue-resident graft T cell

This study assessed the effects of OLT on ACVD and ACVD risk factors in pediatric patients with HoFH. We analyzed lipids, lipoproteins, body mass index, glucose, blood pressure, and cardiovascular imaging in 8 pediatric patients who underwent OLT for HoFH. Total serum cholesterol, LDL-C, lipoprotein (a), and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio decreased to normal values in all subjects (p values <0.001) at 1\u00a0month after OLT and were maintained for the length of follow-up (2 to 6\u00a0years). There were few complications related to surgery or immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients developed mild hypertension. In the first 4 subjects monitored for 4 to 6\u00a0years after OLT, coronary artery disease did not develop or progress except in 1 minor artery in 1 subject and actually regressed in 2 subjects with >50% stenosis. However, aortic valve stenosis progressed in 2 of 4 subjects. In conclusion, OLT is an effective therapeutic option for patients with HoFH with coronary artery disease and persistently elevated serum LDL-C despite maximum medical therapy.

T cells are integral to adaptive immunity; mouse studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both protective immunity and immunoregulation. In humans, however, the early development and function of T cells in tissues remain unexplored. We present here an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ donors in the first two years of life, as compared to adult organ donors, revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation.

No previous study has evaluated APOLT specifically for preadolescent children with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). This population might benefit especially based on greater capacity for liver regeneration. Data from 13 preadolescent children who underwent APOLT were compared to 13 matched controls who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for FHF from 1996 to 2013. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or survival between the 2 groups. However, all surviving OLT recipients (10/13) remain on ISP, while all but 1 surviving APOLT recipient (12/13) showed native liver regeneration, and the first 10 recipients (76.9%) are currently off ISP with 2 additional patients currently weaning. In our experience, APOLT produced excellent survival and high rates of native liver regeneration in preadolescent children with FHF. This represents the largest series to date to report such outcomes. Liberating these children from lifelong ISP without the downside of increased surgical morbidity makes APOLT an attractive alternative.
