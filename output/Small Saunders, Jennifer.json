[{"PMID": "38632343", "Title": "tRNA modification reprogramming contributes to artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.", "Abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin (ART) resistance is driven by mutations in kelch-like protein 13 (PfK13). Quiescence, a key aspect of resistance, may also be regulated by a yet unidentified epigenetic pathway. Transfer RNA modification reprogramming and codon bias translation is a conserved epitranscriptomic translational control mechanism that allows cells to rapidly respond to stress. We report a role for this mechanism in ART-resistant parasites by combining tRNA modification, proteomic and codon usage analyses in ring-stage ART-sensitive and ART-resistant parasites in response to drug. Post-drug, ART-resistant parasites differentially hypomodify mcm5s2U on tRNA and possess a subset of proteins, including PfK13, that are regulated by Lys codon-biased translation. Conditional knockdown of the terminal s2U thiouridylase, PfMnmA, in an ART-sensitive parasite background led to increased ART survival, suggesting that hypomodification can alter the parasite ART response. This study describes an epitranscriptomic pathway via tRNA s2U reprogramming that ART-resistant parasites may employ to survive ART-induced stress.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Plasmodium falciparum", "Drug Resistance", "RNA, Transfer", "Artemisinins", "Antimalarials", "Protozoan Proteins", "Humans", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Proteomics", "Codon"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Small-Saunders", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. jls2302@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ameya", "Last Name": "Sinha", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Talia S", "Last Name": "Bloxham", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Hagenah", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangxin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter R", "Last Name": "Preiser", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Peter C", "Last Name": "Dedon", "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial Resistance IRG, Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. df2260@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature microbiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38059639", "Title": "Additional PfCRT mutations driven by selective pressure for improved fitness can result in the loss of piperaquine resistance and altered Plasmodium falciparum physiology.", "Abstract": "Our study leverages gene editing techniques in Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stage parasites to profile novel mutations in mutant PfCRT, an important mediator of piperaquine resistance, which developed in Southeast Asian field isolates or in parasites cultured for long periods of time.

Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (PPQ) treatment failure rates have risen to as high as 50% in some areas in this region. For PPQ, resistance is driven primarily by a series of mutant alleles of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). PPQ resistance was reported in China three decades earlier, but the molecular driver remained unknown. Herein, we identify a PPQ-resistant pfcrt allele (China C) from Yunnan Province, China, whose genotypic lineage is distinct from the PPQ-resistant pfcrt alleles currently observed in Cambodia. Combining gene editing and competitive growth assays, we report that PfCRT China C confers moderate PPQ resistance while re-sensitizing parasites to chloroquine (CQ) and incurring a fitness cost that manifests as a reduced rate of parasite growth. PPQ transport assays using purified PfCRT isoforms, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight differences in drug transport kinetics and in this transporter's central cavity conformation between China C and the current Southeast Asian PPQ-resistant isoforms. We also report a novel computational model that incorporates empirically determined fitness landscapes at varying drug concentrations, combined with antimalarial susceptibility profiles, mutation rates, and drug pharmacokinetics. Our simulations with PPQ-resistant or -sensitive parasite lines predict that a three-day regimen of PPQ combined with CQ can effectively clear infections and prevent the evolution of PfCRT variants. This work suggests that including CQ in combination therapies could be effective in suppressing the evolution of PfCRT-mediated multidrug resistance in regions where PPQ has lost efficacy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Artemisinins", "Chloroquine", "Computer Simulation", "Drug Resistance, Multiple", "Humans", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Piperazines", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins", "Quinolines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Small-Saunders", "Affiliation": "Center for Malaria Therapeutics and Antimicrobial Resistance, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Hagenah", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn J", "Last Name": "Wicht", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ioanna", "Last Name": "Deni", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeremie", "Last Name": "Vendome", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Gil-Iturbe", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Roepe", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "Center for Malaria Therapeutics and Antimicrobial Resistance, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Filippo", "Last Name": "Mancia", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Margaret J", "Last Name": "Eppstein", "Affiliation": "Vermont Complex Systems Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Center for Malaria Therapeutics and Antimicrobial Resistance, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2022Feb"}, {"PMID": "34820728", "Title": "Relationship Between Body Composition and Death in Patients with COVID-19 Differs Based on the Presence of Gastrointestinal Symptoms.", "Abstract": "Patients with SARS-CoV-2 who present with gastrointestinal symptoms have a milder clinical course than those who do not.

These stages are an understudied part of the lifecycle yet targeting them is an essential component of the effort to shrink the malaria map. The human parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the majority of deaths due to malaria. Our goal was to generate transgenic P. falciparum lines that could complete the lifecycle and produce fluorescent transmission stages for more in-depth and high-throughput studies. Using zinc-finger nuclease technology to engineer an integration site, we generated three transgenic P. falciparum lines in which tdtomato or gfp were stably integrated into the genome. Expression was driven by either stage-specific peg4 and csp promoters or the constitutive ef1a promoter. Phenotypic characterization of these lines demonstrates that they complete the life cycle with high infection rates and give rise to fluorescent mosquito stages.

In Asia, novel PfCRT mutations that emerged on the Dd2 allelic background have recently been implicated in high-level resistance to piperaquine, and N326S and I356T have been associated with genetic backgrounds in which resistance emerged to artemisinin derivatives. By analyzing large-scale genome sequencing data, we report that the predominant Asian CQ-resistant Dd2 haplotype is undetectable in Africa. Instead, the GB4 and previously unexplored Cam783 haplotypes predominate, along with wild-type, drug-sensitive PfCRT that has reemerged as the major haplotype. To interrogate how these alleles impact drug susceptibility, we generated pfcrt-modified isogenic parasite lines spanning the mutational interval between GB4 and Dd2, which includes Cam783 and involves amino acid substitutions at residues 326 and 356. Relative to Dd2, the GB4 and Cam783 alleles were observed to mediate lower degrees of resistance to CQ and the first-line drug amodiaquine, while resulting in higher growth rates. These findings suggest that differences in growth rates, a surrogate of parasite fitness, influence selection in the context of African infections that are frequently characterized by high transmission rates, mixed infections, increased immunity, and less recourse to treatment. We also observe that the Asian Dd2 allele affords partial protection against piperaquine yet does not directly impact artemisinin efficacy. Our results can help inform the regional recommendations of antimalarials, whose activity is influenced by and, in certain cases, enhanced against select PfCRT variant haplotypes.IMPORTANCE Our study defines the allelic distribution of pfcrt, an important mediator of multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, in Africa and Asia. We leveraged whole-genome sequence analysis and gene editing to demonstrate how current drug combinations can select different allelic variants of this gene and shape region-specific parasite population structures. We document the ability of PfCRT mutations to modulate parasite susceptibility to current antimalarials in dissimilar, pfcrt allele-specific ways. This study underscores the importance of actively monitoring pfcrt genotypes to identify emerging patterns of multidrug resistance and help guide region-specific treatment options.", "Keywords": ["Plasmodium falciparum", "drug resistance evolution", "fitness", "malaria", "pfcrt"], "MeSH terms": ["Africa", "Asia", "Drug Resistance, Multiple", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Fitness", "Genetics, Population", "Genotype", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mutant Proteins", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanislaw J", "Last Name": "Gabryszewski", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Small-Saunders", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philipp P", "Last Name": "Henrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sachel", "Last Name": "Mok", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA df2260@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2019Apr30"}]
