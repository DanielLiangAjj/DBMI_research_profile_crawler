There is a pressing need for new drug targets for these diseases, driven by emergence of drug-resistance in Plasmodium and the overall dearth of new drug targets for Schistosoma. Here, we explored the opportunity for pathogen-hopping by evaluating a series of quinoxaline-based anti-schistosomal compounds for activity against P. falciparum. We identified compounds with low nanomolar potency against 3D7 and multidrug-resistant strains. Evolution of resistance using a mutator P. falciparum line revealed a low propensity for resistance. Only one of the series, compound 22, yielded resistance mutations, including point mutations in a non-essential putative hydrolase pfqrp1, as well as copy-number amplification of a phospholipid-translocating ATPase, pfatp2, a potential target. Notably, independently generated CRISPR-edited mutants in pfqrp1 also showed resistance to compound 22 and a related analogue. Moreover, previous lines with pfatp2 copy-number variations were similarly less susceptible to challenge with the new compounds. Finally, we examined whether the predicted hydrolase activity of PfQRP1 underlies its mechanism of resistance, showing that both mutation of the putative catalytic triad and a more severe loss of function mutation elicited resistance. Collectively, we describe a compound series with potent activity against two important pathogens and their potential target in P. falciparum.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mukul", "Last Name": "Rawat", "Affiliation": "Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Gilda", "Last Name": "Padalino", "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences (DLS), Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Brancale", "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, UCT Prague, Prague, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Karl F", "Last Name": "Hoffmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences (DLS), Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Marcus C S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr24"}, {"PMID": "38710833", "Title": "Urgent action is needed to confront artemisinin partial resistance in African malaria parasites.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deus S", "Last Name": "Ishengoma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roly", "Last Name": "Gosling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosario", "Last Name": "Martinez-Vega", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Khalid B", "Last Name": "Beshir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Bailey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chimumbwa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Sutherland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa D", "Last Name": "Conrad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fitsum G", "Last Name": "Tadesse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Juliano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Moses R", "Last Name": "Kamya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wilfred F", "Last Name": "Mbacham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "M\u00e9nard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip J", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jaishree", "Last Name": "Raman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "Tatarsky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sofonias K", "Last Name": "Tessema", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abdoulaye A", "Last Name": "Djimde", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2024Apr25"}, {"PMID": "38639491", "Title": "Novel hydrazone compounds with broad-spectrum antiplasmodial activity and synergistic interactions with antimalarial drugs.", "Abstract": "The development of novel antiplasmodial compounds with broad-spectrum activity against different stages of Plasmodium parasites is crucial to prevent malaria disease and parasite transmission.

The treatment and control of malaria is challenged by resistance to most available drugs, but partial resistance to artemisinins (ART-R), the most important class for the treatment of malaria, was until recently confined to southeast Asia. This situation has changed, with the emergence of ART-R in multiple countries in eastern Africa. ART-R is mediated primarily by single point mutations in the P falciparum kelch13 protein, with several mutations present in African parasites that are now validated resistance mediators based on clinical and laboratory criteria. Major priorities at present are the expansion of genomic surveillance for ART-R mutations across the continent, more frequent testing of the efficacies of artemisinin-based regimens against uncomplicated and severe malaria in trials, more regular assessment of ex-vivo antimalarial drug susceptibilities, consideration of changes in treatment policy to deter the spread of ART-R, and accelerated development of new antimalarial regimens to overcome the impacts of ART-R.

Partial resistance of P. falciparum to artemisinin has been associated with mutations in the propeller domain of the Pfkelch13 gene, resulting in a fraction of ring stages that are able to survive exposure to artemisinin through a temporary growth arrest. Here, we investigated whether the growth arrest in ring-stage parasites reflects a general response to stress. We mimicked a stressful environment in vitro by exposing parasites to chloroquine or dihydroartemisinin (DHA). We observed that early ring-stage parasites pre-exposed to a stressed culture supernatant exhibited a temporary growth arrest and a reduced susceptibility to DHA, as assessed by the ring-stage survival assay, irrespective of their Pfkelch13 genotype. These data suggest that temporary growth arrest of early ring stages may be a constitutive, Pfkelch13-independent survival mechanism in P. falciparum.IMPORTANCEPlasmodium falciparum ring stages have the ability to sense the extracellular environment, regulate their growth, and enter a temporary growth arrest state in response to adverse conditions such as drug exposure. This temporary growth arrest results in reduced susceptibility to artemisinin in vitro. The signal responsible for this process is thought to be small molecules (less than 3 kDa) released by stressed mature-stage parasites. These data suggest that Pfkelch13-dependent artemisinin resistance and the growth arrest phenotype are two complementary but unrelated mechanisms of ring-stage survival in P. falciparum.

A barrier for developing anti-malarial drugs is the ability of the parasite to rapidly generate resistance. We demonstrated that Salinipostin A (SalA), a natural product, kills parasites by inhibiting multiple lipid metabolizing serine hydrolases, a mechanism with a low propensity for resistance. Given the difficulty of employing natural products as therapeutic agents, we synthesized a library of lipidic mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates as bioisosteres of SalA. Two constitutional isomers exhibited divergent anti-parasitic potencies which enabled identification of therapeutically relevant targets. We also confirm that this compound kills parasites through a mechanism that is distinct from both SalA and the pan-lipase inhibitor, Orlistat. Like SalA, our compound induces only weak resistance, attributable to mutations in a single protein involved in multidrug resistance. These data suggest that mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates are a promising, synthetically tractable anti-malarials with a low-propensity to induce resistance.", "Keywords": ["Activity-Based Protein Profiling", "Drug Resistance", "Plasmodium", "activity-based probes", "lipid metabolism", "serine hydrolases"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sunil K", "Last Name": "Narwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Kabeche", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Abegg", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fiona", "Last Name": "Hackett", "Affiliation": "Malaria Biochemistry Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Veronica L", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan K", "Last Name": "Muir", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franco F", "Last Name": "Faucher", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Lovell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Blackman", "Affiliation": "Malaria Biochemistry Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Adibekian", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bogyo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan11"}, {"PMID": "38157513", "Title": "Artemisinin-Resistant HRP2-Negative Malaria in Eritrea.

We mapped k13 as the central mediator of ART resistance in vitro and identified secondary markers. Applying bulk segregant analysis, quantitative trait loci mapping using 34 recombinant haplotypes, and gene editing, our data reveal an epistatic interaction between mutant PfCRT and multicopy plasmepsins 2/3 in mediating high-grade PPQ resistance.

Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors have synergistic effects when combined with current first-line artemisinin and related analogues. Linear peptides that covalently inhibit the proteasome are effective at killing parasites and have a low propensity for inducing resistance. However, these scaffolds generally suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Here we describe the development of covalent, irreversible, macrocyclic inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum proteasome. We identified compounds with excellent potency and low cytotoxicity; however, the first generation suffered from poor microsomal stability. Further optimization of an existing macrocyclic scaffold resulted in an irreversible covalent inhibitor carrying a vinyl sulfone electrophile that retained high potency and low cytotoxicity and had acceptable metabolic stability. Importantly, unlike the parent reversible inhibitor that selected for multiple mutations in the proteasome, with one resulting in a 5,000-fold loss of potency, the irreversible analogue only showed a 5-fold loss in potency for any single point mutation. Furthermore, an epoxyketone analogue of the same scaffold retained potency against a panel of known proteasome mutants. These results confirm that macrocycles are optimal scaffolds to target the malarial proteasome and that the use of a covalent electrophile can greatly reduce the ability of the parasite to generate drug resistance mutations.", "Keywords": ["Plasmodium falciparum;", "antimicrobial resistance", "cyclic peptides"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Bennett",

that overcome emerging drug resistance, whilst considering safety and improving dosing convenience. Discovery efforts have yielded a variety of new molecules, many with novel modes of action, and the most advanced are in late-stage clinical development. These discoveries have led to a deeper understanding of how antimalarial drugs act, the identification of a new generation of drug targets, and multiple structure-based chemistry initiatives. The limited pool of funding means it is vital to prioritize new drug candidates. They should exhibit high potency, a low propensity for resistance, a pharmacokinetic profile that favours infrequent dosing, low cost, preclinical results that demonstrate safety and tolerability in women and infants, and preferably the ability to block Plasmodium transmission to Anopheles mosquito vectors. In this Review, we describe the approaches that have been successful, progress in preclinical and clinical development, and existing challenges.

Through in vitro studies of laboratory strains and clinical isolates, a humanized mouse model, and volunteer infection studies, we identified resistance-associated mutations at 11 amino acid positions. Of these, six (55%) were present in more than one infection model, indicating translatability across models.

With ever increasing resistance to currently deployed drugs, breakthrough compounds with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Here, we explore pyrimidine-based sulfonamides as a new low molecular weight inhibitor class with drug-like physical parameters and a synthetically accessible scaffold. We show that the exemplar, OSM-S-106, has potent activity against parasite cultures, low mammalian cell toxicity and low propensity for resistance development. In vitro evolution of resistance using a slow ramp-up approach pointed to the Plasmodium falciparum cytoplasmic asparaginyl tRNA synthetase (PfAsnRS) as the target, consistent with our finding that OSM-S-106 inhibits protein translation and activates the amino acid starvation response. Targeted mass spectrometry confirms that OSM-S-106 is a pro-inhibitor and that inhibition of PfAsnRS occurs via enzyme-mediated production of an Asn-OSM-S-106 adduct. Human AsnRS is much less susceptible to this reaction hijacking mechanism. X-ray crystallographic studies of human AsnRS in complex with inhibitor adducts and docking of pro-inhibitors into a model of Asn-tRNA-bound PfAsnRS provide insights into the structure activity relationship and the selectivity mechanism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stanley C", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology,

"The Plasmodium falciparum proteasome constitutes a promising antimalarial target, with multiple chemotypes potently and selectively inhibiting parasite proliferation and synergizing with the first-line artemisinin drugs, including against artemisinin-resistant parasites. We compared resistance profiles of vinyl sulfone, epoxyketone, macrocyclic peptide, and asparagine ethylenediamine inhibitors and report that the vinyl sulfones were potent even against mutant parasites resistant to other proteasome inhibitors and did not readily select for resistance, particularly WLL that displays covalent and irreversible binding to the catalytic \u03b22 and \u03b25 proteasome subunits. We also observed instances of collateral hypersensitivity, whereby resistance to one inhibitor could sensitize parasites to distinct chemotypes. Proteasome selectivity was confirmed using CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutant and conditional knockdown parasites. Molecular modeling of proteasome mutations suggested spatial contraction of the \u03b25 P1 binding pocket, compromising compound binding.

High-level PPQ resistance appears to be mediated primarily by novel mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), which enhance parasite survival at high PPQ concentrations in vitro and increase the risk of dihydroartemisinin + PPQ treatment failure in patients. Using isogenic Dd2 parasites expressing contemporary pfcrt alleles with differential in vitro PPQ susceptibilities, we herein characterize the molecular and physiological adaptations that define PPQ resistance in vitro. Using drug uptake and cellular heme fractionation assays we report that the F145I, M343L, and G353V PfCRT mutations differentially impact PPQ and chloroquine efflux. These mutations also modulate proteolytic degradation of host hemoglobin and the chemical inactivation of reactive heme species. Peptidomic analyses reveal significantly higher accumulation of putative hemoglobin-derived peptides in the PPQ-resistant mutant PfCRT isoforms compared to parental PPQ-sensitive Dd2. Joint transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of late trophozoites from PPQ-resistant or -sensitive isogenic lines reveals differential expression of genes involved in protein translation and cellular metabolism. PPQ-resistant parasites also show increased susceptibility to an inhibitor of the P. falciparum M17 aminopeptidase that operates on short globin-derived peptides.

Incorporation of safety evaluation early in the characterization of PMX inhibitors precluded compounds with a long human half-life (t1/2) to be developed. Optimization focused on improving the off-target safety profile led to the identification of UCB7362 that had an improved in vitro and in vivo safety profile but a shorter predicted human t1/2.

In a recent clinical trial for cipargamin, recrudescent parasites emerged, with most having a G358S mutation in PfATP4. Here, we show that PfATP4G358S parasites can withstand micromolar concentrations of cipargamin and (+)-SJ733, while remaining susceptible to antimalarials that do not target PfATP4. The G358S mutation in PfATP4, and the equivalent mutation in Toxoplasma gondii ATP4, decrease the sensitivity of ATP4 to inhibition by cipargamin and (+)-SJ733, thereby protecting parasites from disruption of Na+ regulation. The G358S mutation reduces the affinity of PfATP4 for Na+ and is associated with an increase in the parasite's resting cytosolic [Na+]. However, no defect in parasite growth or transmissibility is observed.

Here we report the exploration of MMV692140 (2) from the Pathogen Box, a collection of 400 compounds that was made available by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) in 2015. Compound 2 was profiled in in\u2005vitro models of malaria and was found to be active against multiple life-cycle stages of Plasmodium parasites. The mode of resistance, and putatively its mode of action, was identified as Plasmodium falciparum translation elongation factor 2 (PfeEF2), which is responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along mRNA. The compound maintains activity against a series of drug-resistant parasite strains. The structural motif of the tetrahydroquinoline (2) was explored in a chemistry program with its structure-activity relationships examined, resulting in the identification of an analog with 30-fold improvement of antimalarial asexual blood stage potency.", "Keywords": ["Malaria", "PfeEF2", "biological activity", "drug discovery", "malaria rate of killing", "malaria resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antimalarials", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Malaria"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Beno\u00eet", "Last Name": "Laleu", "Affiliation": "Medicines for Malaria Venture, International Centre Cointrin, Route de Pr\u00e9-Bois 20, P.O.

Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (PPQ) treatment failure rates have risen to as high as 50% in some areas in this region. For PPQ, resistance is driven primarily by a series of mutant alleles of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). PPQ resistance was reported in China three decades earlier, but the molecular driver remained unknown. Herein, we identify a PPQ-resistant pfcrt allele (China C) from Yunnan Province, China, whose genotypic lineage is distinct from the PPQ-resistant pfcrt alleles currently observed in Cambodia. Combining gene editing and competitive growth assays, we report that PfCRT China C confers moderate PPQ resistance while re-sensitizing parasites to chloroquine (CQ) and incurring a fitness cost that manifests as a reduced rate of parasite growth. PPQ transport assays using purified PfCRT isoforms, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight differences in drug transport kinetics and in this transporter's central cavity conformation between China C and the current Southeast Asian PPQ-resistant isoforms.

across Southeast Asia. In Africa, K13-propeller genotyping confirms the emergence of the R561H mutation in Rwanda and highlights the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 elsewhere. Using gene editing, we show that R561H, along with C580Y and M579I, confer elevated in vitro ART resistance in some African strains, contrasting with minimal changes in ART susceptibility in others. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may slow their dissemination in high-transmission settings, in contrast with R561H that in African 3D7 parasites is fitness neutral. In Cambodia, K13 genotyping highlights the increasing spatio-temporal dominance of C580Y. Editing multiple K13 mutations into a panel of Southeast Asian strains reveals that only the R561H variant yields ART resistance comparable to C580Y. In Asian Dd2 parasites C580Y shows no fitness cost, in contrast with most other K13 mutations tested, including R561H. Editing of point mutations in ferredoxin or mdr2, earlier associated with resistance, has no impact on ART susceptibility or parasite fitness. These data underline the complex interplay between K13 mutations, parasite survival, growth and genetic background in contributing to the spread of ART resistance.", "Keywords": ["CRISPR/Cas9", "P.

Selection studies with imidazopyridine or quinoline-carboxamide compounds also yield changes in ABCI3, this time through gene amplification. Imidazopyridine mode of action is attributed to inhibition of heme detoxification, as evidenced by cellular accumulation and heme fractionation assays.

Screening of a set of PRS ATP-site binders, initially designed for human indications, led to identification of 1-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives representing a novel antimalarial scaffold. Evidence designates cytoplasmic PRS as the drug target. The frontrunner 1 and its active enantiomer 1-S exhibited low-double-digit nanomolar activity against resistant Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) laboratory strains and development of liver schizonts. No cross-resistance with strains resistant to other known antimalarials was noted. In addition, a similar level of growth inhibition was observed against clinical field isolates of Pf and P. vivax. The slow killing profile and the relative high propensity to develop resistance in vitro (minimum inoculum resistance of 8 \u00d7 105 parasites at a selection pressure of 3 \u00d7 IC50) constitute unfavorable features for treatment of malaria. However, potent blood stage and antischizontal activity are compelling for causal prophylaxis which does not require fast onset of action. Achieving sufficient on-target selectivity appears to be particularly challenging and should be the primary focus during the next steps of optimization of this chemical series. Encouraging preliminary off-target profile and oral efficacy in a humanized murine model of Pf malaria allowed us to conclude that 1-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives represent a promising starting point for the identification of novel antimalarial prophylactic agents that selectively target Plasmodium PRS.", "Keywords": ["PRS", "Plasmodium", "malaria", "prolyl-tRNA synthetase"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Humans", "Malaria", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mice", "Plasmodium falciparum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Masanori", "Last Name": "Okaniwa", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Akira", "Last Name": "Shibata", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Atsuko", "Last Name": "Ochida", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuichiro", "Last Name": "Akao", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Karen L", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Shackleford", "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Duffy", "Affiliation": "Discovery Biology, Griffith University, Brisbane Innovation Park, Don Young Road, Nathan, Queensland 4111, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leonardo", "Last Name": "Lucantoni", "Affiliation": "Discovery Biology, Griffith University, Brisbane Innovation Park, Don Young Road, Nathan, Queensland 4111, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sumanta", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Josefine", "Last Name": "Striepen", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sachel", "Last Name": "Mok", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anna Caroline C", "Last Name": "Aguiar", "Affiliation": "Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Av.

Emergence of drug resistance and a shortage of new efficient antimalarials continue to hamper a malaria eradication agenda. Malaria parasites are highly sensitive to changes in the redox environment. Understanding the mechanisms regulating parasite redox could contribute to the design of new drugs. Malaria parasites have a complex network of redox regulatory systems housed in their cytosol, in their mitochondrion and in their plastid (apicoplast). While the roles of enzymes of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways in parasite survival have been explored, the antioxidant role of \u03b1-lipoic acid (LA) produced in the apicoplast has not been tested. To take a first step in teasing a putative role of LA in redox regulation, we analysed a mutant Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain) lacking the apicoplast lipoic acid protein ligase B (lipB) known to be depleted of LA. Our results showed a change in expression of redox regulators in the apicoplast and the cytosol. We further detected a change in parasite central carbon metabolism, with lipB deletion resulting in changes to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Further, in another Plasmodium cell line (NF54), deletion of lipB impacted development in the mosquito, preventing the detection of infectious sporozoite stages. While it is not clear at this point if the observed phenotypes are linked, these findings flag LA biosynthesis as an important subject for further study in the context of redox regulation in asexual stages, and point to LipB as a potential target for the development of new transmission drugs.", "Keywords": ["Antioxidant", "Apicoplast", "Lipoic acid", "Malaria", "Metabolism", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Redox", "Sporogony"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anopheles", "Antimalarials", "Carbon", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Plasmodium falciparum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Biddau", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

Assaying parasites with resistance to antimalarials led us to test whether the series had a similar mechanism of action to chloroquine (CQ).

The malaria pigment hemozoin (HZ) is abundant in target organs of severe malaria, including the lungs, and is known to be a potent innate immune activator of phagocytes. We hypothesized that HZ might also stimulate lung epithelial activation and thereby potentiate lung inflammation. We show here that airway epithelium stimulated with HZ undergoes global transcriptional reprogramming and changes in cell surface protein expression that comprise an epithelial activation phenotype. Proinflammatory signaling is induced, and key cytoadherence molecules are upregulated, including several associated with severe malaria, such as CD36 and ICAM1. Epithelial and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways are transformed, including induction of key metalloproteases and modulation of epithelial junctions. The overall program induced by HZ serves to promote inflammation and neutrophil transmigration, and is recapitulated in a murine model of HZ-induced acute pneumonitis. Together, our data demonstrate a direct role for hemozoin in stimulating epithelial activation that could potentiate lung inflammation in malaria.IMPORTANCE Respiratory distress (RD) is a complication of severe malaria associated with a particularly high risk for death in African children infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum The pathophysiology underlying RD remains poorly understood, and the condition is managed supportively. The parasite-derived factor HZ accumulates in target organs of severe malaria, including the lungs, and is a potent stimulator of immune cells. Our findings demonstrate that HZ causes global activation of lung epithelial cells, a response that directly promotes lung inflammation. HZ stimulates expression of key proinflammatory and cell surface molecules, alters signaling pathways involved in epithelial-matrix remodeling, and promotes neutrophil transmigration and airway inflammation.

The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) transporter plays a central role in parasite resistance to ACT partner drugs through gene copy number variations (CNV) and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using genomic epidemiology, we show that multiple pfmdr1 copies encoding the N86 and 184F haplotype are prevalent across Southeast Asia. Applying genome editing tools on the Southeast Asian Dd2 strain and using a surrogate assay to measure transporter activity in infected red blood cells, we demonstrate that parasites harboring multicopy N86/184F PfMDR1 have a higher Fluo-4 transport capacity compared with those expressing the wild-type N86/Y184 haplotype. Multicopy N86/184F PfMDR1 is also associated with decreased parasite susceptibility to lumefantrine.

Artemisinin resistance is primarily driven by mutations in the P. falciparum K13 protein, which enhance survival of early ring-stage parasites treated with the artemisinin active metabolite dihydroartemisinin in vitro and associate with delayed parasite clearance in vivo However, association of K13 mutations with in vivo artemisinin resistance has been problematic due to the absence of a tractable model. Herein, we have employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to engineer selected orthologous P. falciparum K13 mutations into the K13 gene of an artemisinin-sensitive Plasmodium berghei rodent model of malaria. Introduction of the orthologous P. falciparum K13 F446I, M476I, Y493H, and R539T mutations into P. berghei K13 yielded gene-edited parasites with reduced susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin in the standard 24-h in vitro assay and increased survival in an adapted in vitro ring-stage survival assay. Mutant P. berghei K13 parasites also displayed delayed clearance in vivo upon treatment with artesunate and achieved faster recrudescence upon treatment with artemisinin. Orthologous C580Y and I543T mutations could not be introduced into P. berghei, while the equivalents of the M476I and R539T mutations resulted in significant growth defects. Furthermore, a Plasmodium-selective proteasome inhibitor strongly synergized dihydroartemisinin action in these P. berghei K13 mutant lines, providing further evidence that the proteasome can be targeted to overcome artemisinin resistance. Taken together, our findings provide clear experimental evidence for the involvement of K13 polymorphisms in mediating susceptibility to artemisinins in vitro and, most importantly, under in vivo conditions.IMPORTANCE Recent successes in malaria control have been seriously threatened by the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasite resistance to the frontline artemisinin drugs in Southeast Asia. P. falciparum artemisinin resistance is associated with mutations in the parasite K13 protein, which associates with a delay in the time required to clear the parasites upon drug treatment. Gene editing technologies have been used to validate the role of several candidate K13 mutations in mediating P. falciparum artemisinin resistance in vitro under laboratory conditions. Nonetheless, the causal role of these mutations under in vivo conditions has been a matter of debate. Here, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to introduce K13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance into the related rodent-infecting parasite, Plasmodium berghei Phenotyping of these P. berghei K13 mutant parasites provides evidence of their role in mediating artemisinin resistance in vivo, which supports in vitro artemisinin resistance observations. However, we were unable to introduce some of the P. falciparum K13 mutations (C580Y and I543T) into the corresponding amino acid residues, while other introduced mutations (M476I and R539T equivalents) carried pronounced fitness costs. Our study provides evidence of a clear causal role of K13 mutations in modulating susceptibility to artemisinins in vitro and in vivo using the well-characterized P. berghei model. We also show that inhibition of the P. berghei proteasome offsets parasite resistance to artemisinins in these mutant lines.", "Keywords": ["K13", "Plasmodium berghei", "Plasmodium falciparum", "artemisinin resistance", "gene editing", "malaria", "parasite clearance times", "proteasome", "ring-stage survival assays", "synergy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antimalarials", "Artemisinins", "Drug Resistance", "Female", "Humans", "Malaria", "Mice", "Mutation", "Plasmodium berghei", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Proteasome Inhibitors", "Protozoan Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nelson V", "Last Name": "Simwela", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Barbara H", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dana", "Last Name": "Aghabi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "Bogyo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA df2260@cumc.columbia.edu Andy.Waters@glasgow.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Andrew P", "Last Name": "Waters", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Parasitology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom df2260@cumc.columbia.edu Andy.Waters@glasgow.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2020Nov10"}, {"PMID": "32968076", "Title": "Genetic screens reveal a central role for heme metabolism in artemisinin susceptibility.", "Abstract": "Artemisinins have revolutionized the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria; however, resistance threatens to undermine global control efforts.

Decreased parasite susceptibility is caused by K13 mutations, which are associated clinically with delayed parasite clearance in patients and in vitro with an enhanced ability of ring-stage parasites to survive brief exposure to the active ART metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Herein, we describe a panel of K13-specific monoclonal antibodies and gene-edited parasite lines co-expressing epitope-tagged versions of K13 in trans. By applying an analytical quantitative imaging pipeline, we localize K13 to the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, Rab-positive vesicles, and sites adjacent to cytostomes. These latter structures form at the parasite plasma membrane and traffic hemoglobin to the digestive vacuole wherein artemisinin-activating heme moieties are released. We also provide evidence of K13 partially localizing near the parasite mitochondria upon treatment with dihydroartemisinin. Immunoprecipitation data generated with K13-specific monoclonal antibodies identify multiple putative K13-associated proteins, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecules, mitochondrial proteins, and Rab GTPases, in both K13 mutant and wild-type isogenic lines. We also find that mutant K13-mediated resistance is reversed upon co-expression of wild-type or mutant K13.

antimalarials with distinct modes of action. Enzymes in the glutathione pathway, including glutathione S-transferase (GST), show promise as novel antimalarial targets. This study aims to better understand the biological function of Plasmodium GST, assess its potential as a drug target, and identify novel antiplasmodial compounds using the rodent model P. berghei. By using reverse genetics, we provided evidence that GST is essential for survival of P. berghei intra-erythrocytic stages and is a valid target for drug development. A structural model of the P. berghei glutathione S-transferase (PbGST) protein was generated and used in a structure-based screening of 900,000 compounds from the ChemBridge Hit2Lead library. Forty compounds were identified as potential inhibitors and analyzed in parasite in vitro drug susceptibility assays. One compound, CB-27, exhibited antiplasmodial activity with an EC50 of 0.5 \u03bcM toward P. berghei and 0.9 \u03bcM toward P. falciparum multidrug-resistant Dd2 clone B2 parasites. Moreover, CB-27 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the PbGST enzyme without inhibiting the human ortholog. A shape similarity screening using CB-27 as query resulted in the identification of 24 novel chemical scaffolds, with six of them showing antiplasmodial activity ranging from EC50 of 0.6-4.9 \u03bcM.

We also analyzed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including genomic sequencing of recrudescent parasites. We observed no pharmacokinetic interactions with the combination of M5717 and pyronaridine. M5717 did not negatively impact the rate of kill of the faster-acting pyronaridine, and the latter was able to suppress the selection of M5717-resistant mutants, as well as significantly delay the recrudescence of parasites both with suboptimal and optimal dosing regimens.", "Keywords": ["M5717", "Plasmodium falciparum", "SCID mouse", "drug combination", "isobologram", "malaria", "pyronaridine", "resistant mutant"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antimalarials", "Drug Resistance", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Hemeproteins", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Naphthyridines", "Peptide Elongation Factor 2", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Quinolines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Rottmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Infection Biology, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Jonat", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christin", "Last Name": "Gumpp", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Infection Biology, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marla J", "Last Name": "Giddins", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyan", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Global Statistics for NDD, Immunology, Endocrinology, Fertility & Others, EMD Serono, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lassina", "Last Name": "Badolo", "Affiliation": "Discovery and Development Technologies, Merck Healthcare KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Beatrice", "Last Name": "Greco", "Affiliation": "Global Health Institute of Merck, Eysins, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claude", "Last Name": "Oeuvray", "Affiliation": "Global Health Institute of Merck, Eysins, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Spangenberg", "Affiliation": "Global Health Institute of Merck, Eysins, Switzerland thomas.spangenberg@merckgroup.com."}], "Journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy", "PubDate": "2020Mar24"}, {"PMID": "31978322", "Title": "The Antimalarial Natural Product Salinipostin A Identifies Essential \u03b1/\u03b2 Serine Hydrolases Involved in Lipid Metabolism in P.\u00a0falciparum Parasites.", "Abstract": "Salinipostin A (Sal A) is a potent antiplasmodial marine natural product with an undefined mechanism of action.

For decades, treatment of malaria has relied on chloroquine (CQ), a safe and affordable 4-aminoquinoline that was highly effective against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, until resistance arose in Southeast Asia and South America and spread worldwide1. Clinical resistance to the chemically related current first-line combination drug piperaquine (PPQ) has now emerged regionally, reducing its efficacy2. Resistance to CQ and PPQ has been associated with distinct sets of point mutations in the P. falciparum CQ-resistance transporter PfCRT, a 49-kDa member of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily that traverses the membrane of the acidic digestive vacuole of the parasite3-9. Here we present the structure, at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, of the PfCRT isoform of CQ-resistant, PPQ-sensitive South American 7G8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and antigen-binding fragment technology. Mutations that contribute to CQ and PPQ resistance localize primarily to moderately conserved sites on distinct helices that line a central negatively charged cavity, indicating that this cavity is the principal site of interaction with the positively charged CQ and PPQ. Binding and transport studies reveal that the 7G8 isoform binds both drugs with comparable affinities, and that these drugs are mutually competitive. The 7G8 isoform transports CQ in a membrane\u00a0potential- and pH-dependent manner, consistent with an active efflux mechanism that drives CQ resistance5, but does not transport PPQ. Functional studies on the newly emerging PfCRT F145I and C350R mutations, associated with decreased PPQ susceptibility in Asia and South America, respectively6,9, reveal their ability to mediate PPQ transport in 7G8 variant proteins and to confer resistance in gene-edited parasites. Structural, functional and in silico analyses suggest that distinct mechanistic features mediate the resistance to CQ and PPQ in PfCRT variants. These data provide atomic-level insights into the molecular mechanism of this key mediator of antimalarial treatment failures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chloroquine", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Drug Resistance", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins", "Quinolines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yong Zi", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn J", "Last Name": "Wicht", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Satchal K", "Last Name": "Erramilli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Okombo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremie", "Last Name": "Vendome", "Affiliation": "Schr\u00f6dinger, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Hagenah", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina I", "Last Name": "Giacometti", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey L", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kamil", "Last Name": "Nosol", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Roepe", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clinton S", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony A", "Last Name": "Kossiakoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. mq2102@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. df2260@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Filippo", "Last Name": "Mancia", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. fm123@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31657776", "Title": "Plasmodium falciparum resistance to piperaquine driven by PfCRT.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Asia, Southeastern", "Genomics", "Humans", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Quinolines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York 10032, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Small-Saunders", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York 10032, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "M\u00e9nard", "Affiliation": "Biology of Host-Parasite Interactions Unit, Malaria Genetics and Resistance Group, INSERM U1201, CNRS ERL9195, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York 10032, NY, USA; Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York 10032, NY, USA.

Moreover, most mutations that conferred a modest loss of parasite susceptibility to one inhibitor significantly increased sensitivity to the other. These inhibitors potently synergized multiple chemically diverse classes of antimalarial agents, implicating a shared disruption of proteostasis in their modes of action. These results underscore the potential of targeting the Plasmodium proteasome with covalent small molecule inhibitors as a means of combating multidrug-resistant malaria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antimalarials", "Drug Resistance", "Drug Synergism", "Humans", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Proteasome Inhibitors", "Protozoan Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Barbara H", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Euna", "Last Name": "Yoo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Murithi", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Madeline R", "Last Name": "Luth", "Affiliation": "Division of Host-Microbe Systems & Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pavel", "Last Name": "Afanasyev", "Affiliation": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paula C A", "Last Name": "da Fonseca", "Affiliation": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Winzeler", "Affiliation": "Division of Host-Microbe Systems & Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Caroline L", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bogyo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2019Jun"}, {"PMID": "31080074", "Title": "Structure-Guided Identification of Resistance Breaking Antimalarial N\u2011Myristoyltransferase Inhibitors.", "Abstract": "The attachment of myristate to the N-terminal glycine of certain proteins is largely a co-translational modification catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), and involved in protein membrane-localization.

While the cytochrome bc1-inhibitor atovaquone has potent activity, proguanil's action is attributed to its cyclization-metabolite, cycloguanil. Evidence suggests that proguanil has limited intrinsic activity, associated with mitochondrial-function. Here we demonstrate that proguanil, and cyclization-blocked analogue tBuPG, have potent, but slow-acting, in vitro anti-plasmodial activity. Activity is folate-metabolism and isoprenoid biosynthesis-independent. In yeast dihydroorotate dehydrogenase-expressing parasites, proguanil and tBuPG slow-action remains, while bc1-inhibitor activity switches from comparatively fast to slow-acting. Like proguanil, tBuPG has activity against P. berghei liver-stage parasites. Both analogues act synergistically with bc1-inhibitors against blood-stages in vitro, however cycloguanil antagonizes activity.

In Asia, novel PfCRT mutations that emerged on the Dd2 allelic background have recently been implicated in high-level resistance to piperaquine, and N326S and I356T have been associated with genetic backgrounds in which resistance emerged to artemisinin derivatives. By analyzing large-scale genome sequencing data, we report that the predominant Asian CQ-resistant Dd2 haplotype is undetectable in Africa. Instead, the GB4 and previously unexplored Cam783 haplotypes predominate, along with wild-type, drug-sensitive PfCRT that has reemerged as the major haplotype. To interrogate how these alleles impact drug susceptibility, we generated pfcrt-modified isogenic parasite lines spanning the mutational interval between GB4 and Dd2, which includes Cam783 and involves amino acid substitutions at residues 326 and 356. Relative to Dd2, the GB4 and Cam783 alleles were observed to mediate lower degrees of resistance to CQ and the first-line drug amodiaquine, while resulting in higher growth rates. These findings suggest that differences in growth rates, a surrogate of parasite fitness, influence selection in the context of African infections that are frequently characterized by high transmission rates, mixed infections, increased immunity, and less recourse to treatment. We also observe that the Asian Dd2 allele affords partial protection against piperaquine yet does not directly impact artemisinin efficacy. Our results can help inform the regional recommendations of antimalarials, whose activity is influenced by and, in certain cases, enhanced against select PfCRT variant haplotypes.IMPORTANCE Our study defines the allelic distribution of pfcrt, an important mediator of multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, in Africa and Asia. We leveraged whole-genome sequence analysis and gene editing to demonstrate how current drug combinations can select different allelic variants of this gene and shape region-specific parasite population structures. We document the ability of PfCRT mutations to modulate parasite susceptibility to current antimalarials in dissimilar, pfcrt allele-specific ways.

In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the clustering of a family of virulence genes correlates with their coordinated silencing and has a strong influence on the overall organization of the genome. To identify conserved and species-specific principles of genome organization, we performed Hi-C experiments and generated 3D genome models for five Plasmodium species and two related apicomplexan parasites. Plasmodium species mainly showed clustering of centromeres, telomeres, and virulence genes. In P. falciparum, the heterochromatic virulence gene cluster had a strong repressive effect on the surrounding nuclear space, while this was less pronounced in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium berghei, and absent in Plasmodium yoelii In Plasmodium knowlesi, telomeres and virulence genes were more dispersed throughout the nucleus, but its 3D genome showed a strong correlation with gene expression. The Babesia microti genome showed a classical Rabl organization with colocalization of subtelomeric virulence genes, while the Toxoplasma gondii genome was dominated by clustering of the centromeres and lacked virulence gene clustering. Collectively, our results demonstrate that spatial genome organization in most Plasmodium species is constrained by the colocalization of virulence genes.

Here, we describe a P. falciparum laboratory cross of K13 C580Y mutant with C580 wild-type parasites to investigate ART response phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. After genotyping >400 isolated progeny, we evaluated 20 recombinants in vitro: IC50 measurements of dihydroartemisinin were at similar low nanomolar levels for C580Y- and C580-type progeny (mean ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62-1.61), whereas, in a ring-stage survival assay, the C580Y-type progeny had 19.6-fold (95% CI, 9.76-39.2) higher average counts. In splenectomized Aotus monkeys treated with three daily doses of i.v. artesunate, t1/2 calculations by three different methods yielded mean differences of 0.01 h (95% CI, -3.66 to 3.67), 0.80 h (95% CI, -0.92 to 2.53), and 2.07 h (95% CI, 0.77-3.36) between C580Y and C580 infections. Incidences of recrudescence were 57% in C580Y (4 of 7) versus 70% in C580 (7 of 10) infections (-13% difference; 95% CI, -58% to 35%). Allelic substitution of C580 in a C580Y-containing progeny clone (76H10) yielded a transformant (76H10C580Rev) that, in an infected monkey, recrudesced regularly 13 times over 500 d.

Point Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum that Confer in Vitro Resistance to the Clinical Candidate DSM265.", "Abstract": "Malaria is one of the most challenging human infectious diseases, and both prevention and control have been hindered by the development of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to existing therapies. Several new compounds with novel mechanisms are in clinical development for the treatment of malaria, including DSM265, an inhibitor of Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. To explore the mechanisms by which resistance might develop to DSM265 in the field, we selected for DSM265-resistant P. falciparum parasites in vitro. Any of five different amino acid changes led to reduced efficacy on the parasite and to decreased DSM265 binding to P. falciparum DHODH. The DSM265-resistant parasites retained full sensitivity to atovaquone. All but one of the observed mutations were in the DSM265 binding site, and the remaining C276F was in the adjacent flavin cofactor site. The C276F mutation was previously identified in a recrudescent parasite during a Phase IIa clinical study. We confirmed that this mutation (and the related C276Y) accounted for the full level of observed DSM265 resistance by regenerating the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. X-ray structure analysis of the C276F mutant enzyme showed that conformational changes of nearby residues were required to accommodate the larger F276 residue, which in turn led to a restriction in the size of the DSM265 binding pocket. These findings underscore the importance of developing DSM265 as part of a combination therapy with other agents for successful use against malaria.", "Keywords": ["Plasmodium", "dihydroorotate

falciparum Chloroquine Resistance Transporter.", "Abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance constitutes a major obstacle to the global malaria elimination campaign. Specific mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) mediate resistance to the 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine and impact parasite susceptibility to several partner agents used in current artemisinin-based combination therapies, including amodiaquine. By examining gene-edited parasites, we report that the ability of the wide-spread Dd2 PfCRT isoform to mediate chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance is substantially reduced by the addition of the PfCRT L272F mutation, which arose under blasticidin selection. We also provide evidence that L272F confers a significant fitness cost to asexual blood stage parasites. Studies with amino acid-restricted media identify this mutant as a methionine auxotroph.

Genetically encoded fluorescent redox sensors have recently been described as powerful tools for determining the glutathione-dependent redox potential in living parasites. In the present study, we genomically integrated and expressed the ratiometric redox sensors hGrx1-roGFP2 (human glutaredoxin 1 fused to reduction-oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein) and sfroGFP2 (superfolder roGFP2) in the cytosol of NF54- attB blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Both sensors were evaluated in vitro and in cell culture with regard to their fluorescence properties and reactivity. As genomic integration allows for the stable expression of redox sensors in parasites, we systematically compared single live-cell imaging with plate reader detection. For these comparisons, short-term effects of redox-active compounds were analyzed along with mid- and long-term effects of selected antimalarial agents. Of note, the single components of the redox probes themselves did not influence the redox balance of the parasites. Our analyses revealed comparable results for both the hGrx1-roGFP2 and sfroGFP2 probes, with sfroGFP2 exhibiting a more pronounced fluorescence intensity in cellulo. Accordingly, the sfroGFP2 probe was employed to monitor the fluorescence signals throughout the parasites' asexual life cycle.

However, because of a similarly essential role for the host proteasome, the key property of any antiproteasome therapeutic is selectivity. Several parasite-specific proteasome inhibitors have recently been reported, however, their selectivity must be improved to enable clinical development. Here we describe screening of diverse libraries of non-natural synthetic fluorogenic substrates to identify determinants at multiple positions on the substrate that produce enhanced selectivity. We find that selection of an optimal electrophilic \"warhead\" is essential to enable high selectivity that is driven by the peptide binding elements on the inhibitor. We also find that host cell toxicity is dictated by the extent of coinhibition of the human \u03b22 and \u03b25 subunits. Using this information, we identify compounds with over 3 orders of magnitude selectivity for the parasite enzyme. Optimization of the pharmacological properties resulted in molecules that retained high potency and selectivity, were soluble, sufficiently metabolically stable and orally bioavailable.

We previously showed that the three-dimensional organization of the Plasmodium falciparum genome is strongly associated with gene expression during its replication cycle inside red blood cells. Here, we analyze genome organization in the P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission stages. Major changes occur in the localization and interactions of genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, host cell invasion, sexual differentiation, and master regulation of gene expression.

In vivo studies illustrated the ability of lead HHQs to suppress Plasmodium berghei blood-stage parasite proliferation.

Haemoglobin and haem fractionation assays suggest a mode of action that results in reduced haemozoin levels and might involve inhibition of host haemoglobin uptake into intra-erythrocytic parasites. Furthermore, parasites resistant to HHQs displayed increased susceptibility to several first-line antimalarial drugs, including lumefantrine, confirming that HHQs have a different mode of action to other antimalarials drugs for which PfMDR1 is known to confer resistance.

Alarmingly, P. falciparum strains have acquired resistance to ART across much of Southeast Asia. ART creates widespread protein and lipid damage inside intraerythrocytic parasites, necessitating macromolecule degradation. The proteasome is the main engine of Plasmodium protein degradation. Indeed, proteasome inhibition and ART have shown synergy in ART-resistant parasites. Moreover, ubiquitin modification is associated with altered parasite susceptibility to multiple antimalarials. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), therefore, is an attractive avenue to combat drug resistance. Here, we review recent advances leading to specific targeting of the Plasmodium proteasome.

Using zinc finger nuclease-based gene editing, we report that addition of the C101F mutation to the chloroquine (CQ) resistance-conferring PfCRT Dd2 isoform common to Asia can confer PPQ resistance to cultured parasites. Resistance was demonstrated as significantly higher PPQ concentrations causing 90% inhibition of parasite growth (IC90) or 50% parasite killing (50% lethal dose [LD50]). This mutation also reversed Dd2-mediated CQ resistance, sensitized parasites to amodiaquine, quinine, and artemisinin, and conferred amantadine and blasticidin resistance. Using heme fractionation assays, we demonstrate that PPQ causes a buildup of reactive free heme and inhibits the formation of chemically inert hemozoin crystals. Our data evoke inhibition of heme detoxification in the parasite's acidic digestive vacuole as the primary mode of both the bis-aminoquinoline PPQ and the related 4-aminoquinoline CQ. Both drugs also inhibit hemoglobin proteolysis at elevated concentrations, suggesting an additional mode of action. Isogenic lines differing in their pfmdr1 copy number showed equivalent PPQ susceptibilities. We propose that mutations in PfCRT could contribute to a multifactorial basis of PPQ resistance in field isolates.IMPORTANCE The global agenda to eliminate malaria depends on the continued success of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which target the asexual blood stages of the intracellular parasite Plasmodium Partial resistance to artemisinin, however, is now established in Southeast Asia, exposing the partner drugs to increased selective pressure. Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the first-line partner piperaquine (PPQ) is now spreading rapidly in Cambodia, resulting in clinical treatment failures. Here, we report that a variant form of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, harboring a C101F mutation edited into the chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Dd2 isoform prevalent in Asia, can confer PPQ resistance in cultured parasites. This was accompanied by a loss of CQ resistance. Biochemical assays showed that PPQ, like CQ, inhibits the detoxification of reactive heme that is formed by parasite-mediated catabolism of host hemoglobin. We propose that novel PfCRT variants emerging in the field could contribute to a multigenic basis of PPQ resistance.", "Keywords": ["PfCRT", "Plasmodium falciparum", "artemisinin-based combination therapies", "digestive vacuole", "genome editing", "heme detoxification", "malaria", "piperaquine resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Antimalarials", "Artemisinins", "Cambodia", "Drug Resistance", "Gene Editing", "Humans", "Lethal Dose 50", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins", "Mutation", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protein Isoforms", "Protozoan Proteins", "Quinolines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Satish K", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Devasha", "Last Name": "Redhi", "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jill M", "Last Name": "Combrinck", "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Okombo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Philipp P", "Last Name": "Henrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annie N", "Last Name": "Cowell", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Purva", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Division of Host-Microbe Systems & Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew L", "Last Name": "Stegman", "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Dominican University of California, San Rafael, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan M", "Last Name": "Hoke", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roland A", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Dominican University of California, San Rafael, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Winzeler", "Affiliation": "Division of Host-Microbe Systems & Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sachel", "Last Name": "Mok", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Egan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA df2260@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2017May09"}, {"PMID": "28446690", "Title": "Antimalarial efficacy of MMV390048, an inhibitor of Plasmodium phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase.", "Abstract": "As part of the global effort toward malaria eradication, phenotypic whole-cell screening revealed the 2-aminopyridine class of small molecules as a good starting point to develop new antimalarial drugs.

Discovery and development efforts have identified a series of ozonides with attractive chemical and pharmacological properties that are being touted as suitable replacements. Partial resistance to ART, defined as delayed parasite clearance in malaria patients treated with an ART derivative or an ACT, has been associated with mutations in the P.\u00a0falciparum K13 gene. In light of reports showing that ART derivatives and ozonides share similar modes of action, we have investigated whether parasites expressing mutant K13 are cross-resistant to the ozonides OZ439 (artefenomel) and OZ227 (arterolane). This work used a panel of culture-adapted clinical isolates from Cambodia that were genetically edited to express variant forms of K13. Phenotypic analyses employed ring-stage survival assays (ring-stage survival assay from 0 to 3 h [RSA0-3h]), whose results have earlier been shown to correlate with parasite clearance rates in patients. Our results document cross-resistance between OZ277 and dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semisynthetic derivative of ART, in parasites carrying the K13 mutations C580Y, R539T, and I543T. For OZ439, we observed cross-resistance only for parasites that carried the rare K13 I543T mutation, with no evidence of cross-resistance afforded by the prevalent C580Y mutation. Mixed-culture competition experiments with isogenic lines carrying modified K13 revealed variable growth deficits depending on the K13 mutation and parasite strain and provide a rationale for the broad dissemination of the fitness-neutral K13 C580Y mutation throughout strains currently circulating in Southeast Asia.IMPORTANCE ACTs have helped halve the malaria disease burden in recent years; however, emerging resistance to ART derivatives threatens to reverse this substantial progress. Resistance is driven primarily by mutations in the P.\u00a0falciparum K13 gene. These mutations pose a threat to ozonides, touted as promising alternatives to ARTs that share a similar mode of action. We report that DHA was considerably more potent than OZ439 and OZ277 against ART-sensitive asexual blood-stage parasites cultured in vitro We also document that mutant K13 significantly compromised the activity of the registered drug OZ277. In contrast, OZ439 remained effective against most parasite lines expressing mutant K13, with the exception of I543T that merits further monitoring in field-based OZ439 efficacy studies. K13 mutations differed considerably in their impact on parasite growth rates, in a strain-dependent context, with the most prevalent C580Y mutation being fitness neutral in recently culture-adapted strains from Cambodia, the epicenter of emerging ART resistance.", "Keywords": ["K13/Kelch13", "Plasmodium falciparum", "artemisinin", "drug resistance", "fitness", "gene editing", "ozonides"], "MeSH terms": ["Antimalarials", "Artemisinins", "Cambodia", "Cell Survival", "Drug Resistance", "Heterocyclic Compounds", "Humans", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mutation, Missense", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins", "Virulence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Straimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina F", "Last Name": "Gn\u00e4dig", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara H", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Ehrenberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey A", "Last Name": "Crane", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA df2260@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2017Apr11"}, {"PMID": "28363636", "Title": "Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of the novel long-acting antimalarial DSM265: a two-part first-in-human phase 1a/1b randomised study.", "Abstract": "DSM265 is a novel antimalarial that inhibits plasmodial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis.

falciparum transmission from humans to mosquitoes requires the identification of targetable metabolic processes in the mature (stage V) gametocytes, the sexual stages circulating in the bloodstream. This task is complicated by the apparently low metabolism of these cells, which renders them refractory to most antimalarial inhibitors and constrains the development of specific and sensitive cell-based assays. Here, we identify and functionally characterize the regulatory regions of the P. falciparum gene PF3D7_1234700, encoding a CPW-WPC protein and named here Upregulated in Late Gametocytes (ULG8), which we have leveraged to express reporter genes in mature male and female gametocytes. Using transgenic parasites containing a pfULG8-luciferase cassette, we investigated the susceptibility of stage V gametocytes to compounds specifically affecting redox metabolism. Our results reveal a high sensitivity of mature gametocytes to the glutathione reductase inhibitor and redox cycler drug methylene blue (MB). Using isobologram analysis, we find that a concomitant inhibition of the parasite enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-6-phosphogluconolactonase, a key component of NADPH synthesis, potently synergizes MB activity.

Selective pressures on the subcontinent have recurrently produced several allelic variants of parasite drug resistance genes, including the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt). Despite significant reductions in the deployment of the 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine (CQ), which selected for the mutant pfcrt alleles that halted CQ efficacy decades ago, the parasite pfcrt locus is continuously evolving. This is highlighted by the presence of a highly mutated allele, Cam734 pfcrt, which has acquired the singular ability to confer parasite CQ resistance without an associated fitness cost. Here, we used pfcrt-specific zinc-finger nucleases to genetically dissect this allele in the pathogenic setting of asexual blood-stage infection. Comparative analysis of drug resistance and growth profiles of recombinant parasites that express Cam734 or variants thereof, Dd2 (the most common Southeast Asian variant), or wild-type pfcrt, revealed previously unknown roles for PfCRT mutations in modulating parasite susceptibility to multiple antimalarial agents. These results were generated in the GC03 strain, used in multiple earlier pfcrt studies, and might differ in natural isolates harboring this allele. Results presented herein show that Cam734-mediated CQ resistance is dependent on the rare A144F mutation that has not been observed beyond Southeast Asia, and reveal distinct impacts of this and other Cam734-specific mutations on CQ resistance and parasite growth rates. Biochemical assays revealed a broad impact of mutant PfCRT isoforms on parasite metabolism, including nucleoside triphosphate levels, hemoglobin catabolism and disposition of heme, as well as digestive vacuole volume and pH.

development and deployment in the field. We used conventional drug resistance selection as well as a regime of limiting dilution at early stages of drug treatment to probe two antimalarial imidazolopiperazines, KAF156 and GNF179. The latter approach permits the isolation of low-fitness mutants that might otherwise be out-competed during selection. Whole-genome sequencing of 24 independently derived resistant Plasmodium falciparum clones revealed four parasites with mutations in the known cyclic amine resistance locus (pfcarl) and a further 20 with mutations in two previously unreported P. falciparum drug resistance genes, an acetyl-CoA transporter (pfact) and a UDP-galactose transporter (pfugt). Mutations were validated both in vitro by CRISPR editing in P. falciparum and in vivo by evolution of resistant Plasmodium berghei mutants. Both PfACT and PfUGT were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by fluorescence microscopy. As mutations in pfact and pfugt conveyed resistance against additional unrelated chemical scaffolds, these genes are probably involved in broad mechanisms of antimalarial drug resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michelle Yi-Xiu", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "LaMonte", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus C S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christin", "Last Name": "Reimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bee Huat", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Victoria", "Last Name": "Corey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bianca F", "Last Name": "Tjahjadi", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Adeline", "Last Name": "Chua", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Nachon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Wintjens", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopolymers and Supramolecular Nanomaterials, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gedeck", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Benoit", "Last Name": "Malleret", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, 117545 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "Renia", "Affiliation": "Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*Star, 138648 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Ghislain M C", "Last Name": "Bonamy", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Paul Chi-Lui", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, 119077 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Bryan K S", "Last Name": "Yeung", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Eric D", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Technology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liting", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thierry T", "Last Name": "Diagana", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Winzeler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pablo", "Last Name": "Bifani", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, 138670 Singapore."}], "Journal": "Nature microbiology", "PubDate": "2016Sep19"}, {"PMID": "27467575", "Title": "Open Source Drug Discovery with the Malaria Box Compound Collection for Neglected Diseases and Beyond.", "Abstract": "A major cause of the paucity of new starting points for drug discovery is the lack of interaction between academia and industry. Much of the global resource in biology is present in universities, whereas the focus of medicinal chemistry is still largely within industry. Open source drug discovery, with sharing of information, is clearly a first step towards overcoming this gap. But the interface could especially be bridged through a scale-up of open sharing of physical compounds, which would accelerate the finding of new starting points for drug discovery. The Medicines for Malaria Venture Malaria Box is a collection of over 400 compounds representing families of structures identified in phenotypic screens of pharmaceutical and academic libraries against the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite. The set has now been distributed to almost 200 research groups globally in the last two years, with the only stipulation that information from the screens is deposited in the public domain. This paper reports for the first time on 236 screens that have been carried out against the Malaria Box and compares these results with 55 assays that were previously published, in a format that allows a meta-analysis of the combined dataset. The combined biochemical and cellular assays presented here suggest mechanisms of action for 135 (34%) of the compounds active in killing multiple life-cycle stages of the malaria parasite, including asexual blood, liver, gametocyte, gametes and insect ookinete stages. In addition, many compounds demonstrated activity against other pathogens, showing hits in assays with 16 protozoa, 7 helminths, 9 bacterial and mycobacterial species, the dengue fever mosquito vector, and the NCI60 human cancer cell line panel of 60 human tumor cell lines. Toxicological, pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties were collected on all the compounds, assisting in the selection of the most promising candidates for murine proof-of-concept experiments and medicinal chemistry programs. The data for all of these assays are presented and analyzed to show how outstanding leads for many indications can be selected. These results reveal the immense potential for translating the dispersed expertise in biological assays involving human pathogens into drug discovery starting points, by providing open access to new families of molecules, and emphasize how a small additional investment made to help acquire and distribute compounds, and sharing the data, can catalyze drug discovery for dozens of different indications. Another lesson is that when multiple screens from different groups are run on the same library, results can be integrated quickly to select the most valuable starting points for subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antimalarials", "Datasets as Topic", "Drug Discovery", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Humans", "Malaria", "Neglected Diseases", "Small Molecule

Chemotherapy may fail either due to pre-existing resistance or evolution of drug-resistant parasites. Here we use a diverse set of antimalarial compounds to investigate the acquisition of drug resistance and the degree of cross-resistance against common resistance alleles. We assess cross-resistance using a set of 15 parasite lines carrying resistance-conferring alleles in pfatp4, cytochrome bc1, pfcarl, pfdhod, pfcrt, pfmdr, pfdhfr, cytoplasmic prolyl t-RNA synthetase or hsp90. Subsequently, we assess whether resistant parasites can be obtained after several rounds of drug selection. Twenty-three of the 48 in vitro selections result in resistant parasites, with time to resistance onset ranging from 15 to 300 days. Our data indicate that pre-existing resistance may not be a major hurdle for novel-target antimalarial candidates, and focusing our attention on fast-killing compounds may result in a slower onset of clinical resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antimalarials", "Clone Cells", "Drug Resistance", "INDEL Mutation", "Mutation", "Parasites", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Victoria C", "Last Name": "Corey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive 0741, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda K", "Last Name": "Lukens", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Infectious Disease, Harvard T.H.

Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to genetically modify the multidrug resistance-1 transporter PfMDR1 at amino acids 86 and 184, and demonstrate that the widely prevalent N86Y mutation augments resistance to the ACT partner drug amodiaquine and the former first-line agent chloroquine. In contrast, N86Y increases parasite susceptibility to the partner drugs lumefantrine and mefloquine, and the active artemisinin metabolite dihydroartemisinin. The PfMDR1 N86 plus Y184F isoform moderately reduces piperaquine potency in strains expressing an Asian/African variant of the chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT.

One earlier proposed explanation for Southeast Asia being a hotbed of resistance has been the hypermutability or \"Accelerated Resistance to Multiple Drugs\" (ARMD) phenotype, whereby multidrug-resistant Southeast Asian parasites were reported to exhibit 1,000-fold higher rates of resistance to unrelated antimalarial agents when compared to drug-sensitive parasites. However, three recent studies do not recapitulate this hypermutability phenotype. Intriguingly, genome sequencing of recently derived multidrug-resistant Cambodian isolates has identified a high proportion of DNA repair gene mutations in multidrug-resistant parasites, suggesting their potential role in shaping local parasite evolution. By adapting fluctuation assays for use in P. falciparum, we have examined the in vitro mutation rates of five recent Cambodian isolates and three reference laboratory strains. For these studies we also generated a knockout parasite line lacking the DNA repair factor Exonuclease I. In these assays, parasites were typed for their ability to acquire resistance to KAE609, currently in advanced clinical trials, yielding 13 novel mutations in the Na+/H+-ATPase PfATP4, the primary resistance determinant. We observed no evidence of hypermutability. Instead, we found evidence of a mild mutator (up to a 3.4-fold increase in mutation rate) phenotype in two artemisinin-resistant Cambodian isolates, which carry DNA repair gene mutations. We observed that one such mutation in the Mismatch Repair protein Mlh1 contributes to the mild mutator phenotype when modeled in yeast (scmlh1-P157S).

Improved therapeutic strategies are required to protect existing drugs and enhance treatment efficacy. We report that the piperazine-containing compound ACT-451840 exhibits single-digit nanomolar inhibition of the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages and transmissible gametocyte forms. Genome sequence analyses of in vitro-derived ACT-451840-resistant parasites revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfmdr1, which encodes a digestive vacuole membrane-bound ATP-binding cassette transporter known to alter P. falciparum susceptibility to multiple first-line antimalarials. CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing confirmed that PfMDR1 point mutations mediated ACT-451840 resistance. Resistant parasites demonstrated increased susceptibility to the clinical drugs lumefantrine, mefloquine, quinine and amodiaquine.

Infection by unicellular, obligate intracellular Plasmodium parasites causes malaria. The emergence of resistance to current antimalarial drugs necessitates the development of novel therapeutics. A potential novel drug target is the purine import transporter. Because Plasmodium parasites are purine auxotrophic, they must import purines from their host to fulfill metabolic requirements. They import purines via equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) homologs. Recently, we used a yeast-based high-throughput screen to identify inhibitors of the P. falciparum ENT1 (PfENT1) that kill P. falciparum parasites in culture. P. berghei infection of mice is an animal model for human malaria. Because P. berghei ENT1 (PbENT1) shares only 60% amino acid sequence identity with PfENT1, we sought to characterize PbENT1 and its sensitivity to our PfENT1 inhibitors. We expressed PbENT1 in purine auxotrophic yeast and used radiolabeled substrate uptake to characterize its function. We showed that PbENT1 transports both purines and pyrimidines. It preferred nucleosides compared with nucleobases. Inosine (IC50 = 3.7 \u00b5M) and guanosine (IC50 = 21.3 \u00b5M) had the highest affinities. Our recently discovered PfENT1 inhibitors were equally effective against both PbENT1- and PfENT1-mediated purine uptake. The PfENT1 inhibitors are at least 10-fold more potent against PfENT1 than human hENT1. They kill P. berghei parasites in 24-hour ex vivo culture. Thus, the P. berghei murine malaria model may be useful to evaluate the efficacy of PfENT1 inhibitors in vivo and their therapeutic potential for treatment of malaria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1", "Female", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Mice", "Plasmodium berghei", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Substrate Specificity", "Time Factors", "Tritium", "Uridine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Avish", "Last Name": "Arora", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Roman", "Last Name": "Deniskin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yvett", "Last Name": "Sosa", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sita Nirupama", "Last Name": "Nishtala", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Philipp P", "Last Name": "Henrich", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "T R Santha", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Myles H", "Last Name": "Akabas", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology and Biophysics (A.A., R.D., Y.S., S.N.N., M.H.A.) and Neuroscience and Medicine (M.H.A.), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; and Departments Microbiology and Immunology (P.P.H., T.R.S.K., D.A.F.) and Medicine (D.A.F.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York myles.akabas@einstein.yu.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}, {"PMID": "26908582", "Title": "Combinatorial Genetic Modeling of pfcrt-Mediated Drug Resistance Evolution in Plasmodium falciparum.", "Abstract": "The emergence of drug resistance continuously threatens global control of infectious diseases, including malaria caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum A critical parasite determinant is the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), the primary mediator of chloroquine (CQ) resistance (CQR), and a pleiotropic modulator of susceptibility to several first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy partner drugs. Aside from the validated CQR molecular marker K76T, P. falciparum parasites have acquired at least three additional pfcrt mutations, whose contributions to resistance and fitness have been heretofore unclear. Focusing on the quadruple-mutant Ecuadorian PfCRT haplotype Ecu1110 (K76T/A220S/N326D/I356L), we genetically modified the pfcrt locus of isogenic, asexual blood stage P. falciparum parasites using zinc-finger nucleases, producing all possible combinations of intermediate pfcrt alleles. Our analysis included the related quintuple-mutant PfCRT haplotype 7G8 (Ecu1110 + C72S) that is widespread throughout South America and the Western Pacific. Drug susceptibilities and in vitro growth profiles of our combinatorial pfcrt-modified parasites were used to simulate the mutational trajectories accessible to parasites as they evolved CQR. Our results uncover unique contributions to parasite drug resistance and growth for mutations beyond K76T and predict critical roles for the CQ metabolite monodesethyl-CQ and the related quinoline-type drug amodiaquine in driving mutant pfcrt evolution. Modeling outputs further highlight the influence of parasite proliferation rates alongside gains in drug resistance in dictating successful trajectories.

In low-transmission settings, such as South America, drug resistance mutations can attain 100% prevalence, thereby precluding the return of WT parasites after the complete removal of drug pressure. In French Guiana, despite the fixation of the K76T allele, the prevalence of CQR isolates progressively dropped from >90% to <30% during 17 y after CQ withdrawal in 1995. Using a genome-wide association study with CQ-sensitive (CQS) and CQR isolates, we have identified a single mutation in pfcrt encoding a C350R substitution that is associated with the restoration of CQ susceptibility. Genome editing of the CQR reference strain 7G8 to incorporate PfCRT C350R caused a complete loss of CQR. A retrospective molecular survey on 580 isolates collected from 1997 to 2012 identified all C350R mutant parasites as being CQS. This mutation emerged in 2002 and rapidly spread throughout the P. falciparum population. The C350R allele is also associated with a significant decrease in piperaquine susceptibility in vitro, suggesting that piperaquine pressure in addition to potential fitness costs associated with the 7G8-type CQR pfcrt allele may have selected for this mutation.

Continued progress in combating malaria requires development of new, easy to administer drug combinations with broad-ranging activity against all manifestations of the disease. DSM265, a triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitor of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), is the first DHODH inhibitor to reach clinical development for treatment of malaria. We describe studies profiling the biological activity, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, and safety of DSM265, which supported its advancement to human trials. DSM265 is highly selective toward DHODH of the malaria parasite Plasmodium, efficacious against both blood and liver stages of P. falciparum, and active against drug-resistant parasite isolates. Favorable pharmacokinetic properties of DSM265 are predicted to provide therapeutic concentrations for more than 8 days after a single oral dose in the range of 200 to 400 mg. DSM265 was well tolerated in repeat-dose and cardiovascular safety studies in mice and dogs, was not mutagenic, and was inactive against panels of human enzymes/receptors. The excellent safety profile, blood- and liver-stage activity, and predicted long half-life in humans position DSM265 as a new potential drug combination partner for either single-dose treatment or once-weekly chemoprevention. DSM265 has advantages over current treatment options that are dosed daily or are inactive against the parasite liver stage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Area Under Curve", "Caco-2 Cells", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase", "Dogs", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Haplorhini", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Pyrimidines", "Rabbits", "Substrate Specificity", "Triazoles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margaret A", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 6001 Forest Park Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390-9041, USA. margaret.phillips@utsouthwestern.edu susan.charman@monash.edu."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Lotharius", "Affiliation": "Medicines for Malaria Venture, 1215 Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Kennan", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064-6104, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Departments of Chemistry and Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Dayan", "Affiliation": "Medicines for Malaria Venture, 1215 Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Karen L", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline W", "Last Name": "Njoroge", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 6001 Forest Park Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390-9041, USA."}, {"First Name": "Farah", "Last Name": "El Mazouni", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 6001 Forest Park Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390-9041, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanbin", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064-6104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sreekanth", "Last Name": "Kokkonda", "Affiliation": "Departments of Chemistry and Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diana R", "Last Name": "Tomchick", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9041, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyi", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 6001 Forest Park Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390-9041, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor", "Last Name": "Laird", "Affiliation": "Medicines for Malaria Venture, 1215 Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Sangeeta N", "Last Name": "Bhatia", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology/Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "March", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology/Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline L", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

artemisinin resistance.", "Abstract": "Successful control of falciparum malaria depends greatly on treatment with artemisinin combination therapies. Thus, reports that resistance to artemisinins (ARTs) has emerged, and that the prevalence of this resistance is increasing, are alarming. ART resistance has recently been linked to mutations in the K13 propeller protein. We undertook a detailed kinetic analysis of the drug responses of K13 wild-type and mutant isolates of Plasmodium falciparum sourced from a region in Cambodia (Pailin). We demonstrate that ART treatment induces growth retardation and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indicative of a cellular stress response that engages the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We show that resistant parasites exhibit lower levels of ubiquitinated proteins and delayed onset of cell death, indicating an enhanced cell stress response. We found that the stress response can be targeted by inhibiting the proteasome. Accordingly, clinically used proteasome inhibitors strongly synergize ART activity against both sensitive and resistant parasites, including isogenic lines expressing mutant or wild-type K13. Synergy is also observed against Plasmodium berghei in vivo. We developed a detailed model of parasite responses that enables us to infer, for the first time, in vivo parasite clearance profiles from in vitro assessments of ART sensitivity. We provide evidence that the clinical marker of resistance (delayed parasite clearance) is an indirect measure of drug efficacy because of the persistence of unviable parasites with unchanged morphology in the circulation, and we suggest alternative approaches for the direct measurement of viability. Our model predicts that extending current three-day ART treatment courses to four days, or splitting the doses, will efficiently clear resistant parasite infections. This work provides a rationale for improving the detection of ART resistance in the field and for treatment strategies that can be employed in areas with ART resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Artemisinins", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Resistance", "Genome, Protozoan", "Mutation", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Con", "Last Name": "Dogovski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stanley C", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Gaetan", "Last Name": "Burgio", "Affiliation": "John Curtin School of Medical Research, the Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia; Australian School of Advanced Medicine, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jess", "Last Name": "Bridgford", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sachel", "Last Name": "Mok", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "McCaw", "Affiliation": "Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Childrens Hospital, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Kesinee", "Last Name": "Chotivanich", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Shannon", "Last Name": "Kenny", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Gn\u00e4dig", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Straimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Zbynek", "Last Name": "Bozdech", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Arjen M", "Last Name": "Dondorp", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Centre for Tropical Medicine, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Foote", "Affiliation": "John Curtin School of Medical Research, the Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nectarios", "Last Name": "Klonis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leann", "Last Name": "Tilley", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25898991", "Title": "Balancing drug resistance and growth rates via compensatory mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter.", "Abstract": "The widespread use of chloroquine to treat Plasmodium falciparum infections has resulted in the selection and dissemination of variant haplotypes of the primary resistance determinant PfCRT.

Furthermore, a highly mutated pfcrt allele from Cambodia (Cam734) conferred moderate chloroquine resistance and enhanced growth rates, when tested against wild-type pfcrt in co-culture competition assays. These three alleles mediated cross-resistance to amodiaquine, an antimalarial drug widely used in Africa.

Understanding the genetic basis of resistance is critical to the success of treatment and intervention strategies. A novel locus associated with antimalarial resistance, ap2-mu (encoding the mu chain of the adaptor protein 2 [AP2] complex), was recently identified in studies on the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi (pcap2-mu). Furthermore, analysis in Kenyan malaria patients of polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum ap2-mu homologue, pfap2-mu, found evidence that differences in the amino acid encoded by codon 160 are associated with enhanced parasite survival in vivo following combination treatments which included artemisinin derivatives. Here, we characterize the role of pfap2-mu in mediating the in vitro antimalarial drug response of P. falciparum by generating transgenic parasites constitutively expressing codon 160 encoding either the wild-type Ser (Ser160) or the Asn mutant (160Asn) form of pfap2-mu. Transgenic parasites carrying the pfap2-mu 160Asn allele were significantly less sensitive to dihydroartemisinin using a standard 48-h in vitro test, providing direct evidence of an altered parasite response to artemisinin. Our data also provide evidence that pfap2-mu variants can modulate parasite sensitivity to quinine. No evidence was found that pfap2-mu variants contribute to the slow-clearance phenotype exhibited by P. falciparum in Cambodian patients treated with artesunate monotherapy. These findings provide compelling evidence that pfap2-mu can modulate P. falciparum responses to multiple drugs.

Mechanistically, cyt bc1 facilitates the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and contains both oxidative (Qo) and reductive (Qi) catalytic sites that are amenable to small-molecule inhibition. Although many antimalarial compounds, including ATV, effectively target the Qo site, it has been challenging to design selective Qi site inhibitors with the ability to circumvent clinical ATV resistance, and little is known about how chemical structure contributes to site selectivity within cyt bc1. Here, we used the proposed Qi site inhibitor ELQ-300 to generate a drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum clone containing an I22L mutation at the Qi region of cyt b. Using this D1 clone and the Y268S Qo mutant strain, P. falciparum Tm90-C2B, we created a structure-activity map of Qi versus Qo site selectivity for a series of endochin-like 4(1H)-quinolones (ELQs).

We developed a robust yeast-based growth assay that is potentially applicable to many equilibrative transporters. As proof of principle, we applied our approach to Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfENT1). PfENT1 inhibitors might serve as novel antimalarial drugs since PfENT1-mediated purine import is essential for parasite proliferation. To identify PfENT1 inhibitors, we screened 64\u202f560 compounds and identified 171 by their ability to rescue the growth of PfENT1-expressing fui1\u0394 yeast in the presence of a cytotoxic PfENT1 substrate, 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd). In secondary assays, nine of the highest activity compounds inhibited PfENT1-dependent growth of a purine auxotrophic yeast strain with adenosine as the sole purine source (IC50 0.2-2 \u03bcM). These nine compounds completely blocked [(3)H]adenosine uptake into PfENT1-expressing yeast and erythrocyte-free trophozoite-stage parasites (IC50 5-50 nM), and inhibited chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant parasite proliferation (IC50 5-50 \u03bcM). Wild-type (WT) parasite IC50 values were up to 4-fold lower compared to PfENT1-knockout (pfent1\u0394) parasites. pfent1\u0394 parasite killing showed a delayed-death phenotype not observed with WT. We infer that, in parasites, the compounds inhibit both PfENT1 and a secondary target with similar efficacy. The secondary target identity is unknown, but its existence may reduce the likelihood of parasites developing resistance to PfENT1 inhibitors. Our data support the hypothesis that blocking purine transport through PfENT1 may be a novel and compelling approach for antimalarial drug development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine", "Antimalarials", "Axenic Culture", "Biological Transport", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Complementation Test", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Nucleobase, Nucleoside, Nucleotide, and Nucleic Acid Transport Proteins", "Nucleoside Transport Proteins", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Trophozoites", "Uridine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "I J", "Last Name": "Frame", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roman", "Last Name": "Deniskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Rinderspacher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francine", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shi-Xian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Moir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sophie H", "Last Name": "Adjalley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olivia", "Last Name": "Coburn-Flynn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Willis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myles H", "Last Name": "Akabas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2015Mar20"}, {"PMID": "25502314", "Title": "Drug resistance.

The process of developing these compounds as drug leads and studying the cellular responses they induce is revealing new targets that regulate key processes in the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. We disclose herein that the clinical candidate (+)-SJ733 acts upon one of these targets, ATP4. ATP4 is thought to be a cation-transporting ATPase responsible for maintaining low intracellular Na(+) levels in the parasite. Treatment of parasitized erythrocytes with (+)-SJ733 in vitro caused a rapid perturbation of Na(+) homeostasis in the parasite. This perturbation was followed by profound physical changes in the infected cells, including increased membrane rigidity and externalization of phosphatidylserine, consistent with eryptosis (erythrocyte suicide) or senescence. These changes are proposed to underpin the rapid (+)-SJ733-induced clearance of parasites seen in vivo. Plasmodium falciparum ATPase 4 (pfatp4) mutations that confer resistance to (+)-SJ733 carry a high fitness cost. The speed with which (+)-SJ733 kills parasites and the high fitness cost associated with resistance-conferring mutations appear to slow and suppress the selection of highly drug-resistant mutants in vivo.

We hereby report on a dual-luciferase gametocyte assay with immature and mature P. falciparum gametocyte stages expressing red and green-emitting luciferases from Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus under the control of the parasite sexual stage-specific pfs16 gene promoter. The assay was validated with reference antimalarial drugs and allowed to quantitatively and simultaneously measure stage-specific drug effects on parasites at different developmental stages. The optimized assay, requiring only 48 h incubation with drugs and using a cost-effective luminogenic substrate, significantly reduces assay cost and time in comparison to state-of-the-art analogous assays. The assay had a Z' factor of 0.71 \u00b1 0.03, and it is suitable for implementation in 96- and 384-well microplate formats.

Despite its crucial role in evolutionary processes, the mechanistic details of how robustness originates remain elusive. Using an evolutionary trajectory analysis approach, we demonstrate how robustness evolved in malaria parasites under selective pressure from an antimalarial drug inhibiting the folate synthesis pathway. A series of four nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions at the targeted enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), render the parasites highly resistant to the antifolate drug pyrimethamine. Nevertheless, the stepwise gain of these four dhfr mutations results in tradeoffs between pyrimethamine resistance and parasite fitness. Here, we report the epistatic interaction between dhfr mutations and amplification of the gene encoding the first upstream enzyme in the folate pathway, GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1). gch1 amplification confers low level pyrimethamine resistance and would thus be selected for by pyrimethamine treatment. Interestingly, the gch1 amplification can then be co-opted by the parasites because it reduces the cost of acquiring drug-resistant dhfr mutations downstream in the same metabolic pathway. The compensation of compromised fitness by extra GCH1 is an example of how robustness can evolve in a system and thus expand the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories leading toward highly resistant alleles. The evolution of robustness during the gain of drug-resistant mutations has broad implications for both the development of new drugs and molecular surveillance for resistance to existing drugs.", "Keywords": ["drug resistance", "evolution", "malaria", "robustness"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Antimalarials", "Biological Evolution", "Drug Resistance", "Epistasis, Genetic", "GTP Cyclohydrolase", "Genes, Protozoan", "Genetic Fitness", "Humans", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Pyrimethamine", "Signal Transduction", "Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krittikorn", "Last Name": "K\u00fcmpornsin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Charin", "Last Name": "Modchang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, ThailandBiophysics Group, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Adina", "Last Name": "Heinberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Eric H", "Last Name": "Ekland", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Piyaporn", "Last Name": "Jirawatcharadech", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Pornpimol", "Last Name": "Chobson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Nattida", "Last Name": "Suwanakitti", "Affiliation": "National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Sastra", "Last Name": "Chaotheing", "Affiliation": "National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Prapon", "Last Name": "Wilairat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Kirk W", "Last Name": "Deitsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sumalee", "Last Name": "Kamchonwongpaisan", "Affiliation": "National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NYDivision of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Kirkman", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NYDivision of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yongyuth", "Last Name": "Yuthavong", "Affiliation": "National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Thanat", "Last Name": "Chookajorn", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, ThailandCenter of Excellence in Malaria, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand thanat.cho@mahidol.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular biology and evolution", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24465196", "Title": "Modeling within-host effects of drugs on Plasmodium falciparum transmission and prospects for malaria elimination.", "Abstract": "Achieving a theoretical foundation for malaria elimination will require a detailed understanding of the quantitative relationships between patient treatment-seeking behavior, treatment coverage, and the effects of curative therapies that also block Plasmodium parasite transmission to mosquito vectors. Here, we report a mechanistic, within-host mathematical model that uses pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to simulate the effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) on Plasmodium falciparum transmission. To contextualize this model, we created a set of global maps of the fold reductions that would be necessary to reduce the malaria R C (i.e. its basic reproductive number under control) to below 1 and thus interrupt transmission. This modeling was applied to low-transmission settings, defined as having a R 0<10 based on 2010 data. Our modeling predicts that treating 93-98% of symptomatic infections with an ACT within five days of fever onset would interrupt malaria transmission for \u223c91% of the at-risk population of Southeast Asia and \u223c74% of the global at-risk population, and lead these populations towards malaria elimination. This level of treatment coverage corresponds to an estimated 81-85% of all infected individuals in these settings. At this coverage level with ACTs, the addition of the gametocytocidal agent primaquine affords no major gains in transmission reduction. Indeed, we estimate that it would require switching \u223c180 people from ACTs to ACTs plus primaquine to achieve the same transmission reduction as switching a single individual from untreated to treated with ACTs. Our model thus predicts that the addition of gametocytocidal drugs to treatment regimens provides very small population-wide benefits and that the focus of control efforts in Southeast Asia should be on increasing prompt ACT coverage.

The resistance-conferring form of PfCRT (PfCRT(CQR)) mediates CQ resistance by effluxing the drug from the parasite's digestive vacuole, the acidic compartment in which CQ exerts its antiplasmodial effect. PfCRT(CQR) can also decrease the parasite's susceptibility to other quinoline drugs, including the current antimalarials quinine and amodiaquine. Here we describe interactions between PfCRT(CQR) and a series of dimeric quinine molecules using a Xenopus laevis oocyte system for the heterologous expression of PfCRT and using an assay that detects the drug-associated efflux of H(+) ions from the digestive vacuole in parasites that harbor different forms of PfCRT. The antiplasmodial activities of dimers 1 and 6 were also examined in vitro (against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum) and in vivo (against drug-sensitive P. berghei). Our data reveal that the quinine dimers are the most potent inhibitors of PfCRT(CQR) reported to date. Furthermore, the lead compounds (1 and 6) were not effluxed by PfCRT(CQR) from the digestive vacuole but instead accumulated to very high levels within this organelle. Both 1 and 6 exhibited in vitro antiplasmodial activities that were inversely correlated with CQ. Moreover, the additional parasiticidal effect exerted by 1 and 6 in the drug-resistant parasites was attributable, at least in part, to their ability to inhibit PfCRT(CQR).

Previously, we observed that during hepatocyte infection, Plasmodium discards organelles involved in invasion and expands those implicated in biosynthetic pathways. We hypothesized that this process is regulated by autophagy. Plasmodium spp. possess a rudimentary set of known autophagy-related proteins that includes the ortholog of yeast Atg8. In this study, we analyzed the activity of the ATG8-conjugation pathway over the course of the lifecycle of Plasmodium falciparum and during the liver stage of Plasmodium berghei. We engineered a transgenic P. falciparum strain expressing mCherry-PfATG8. These transgenic parasites expressed mCherry-PfATG8 in human hepatocytes and erythrocytes, and in the midgut and salivary glands of Anopheles mosquitoes. In all observed stages, mCherry-PfATG8 was localized to tubular structures. Our EM and colocalization studies done in P. berghei showed the association of PbATG8 on the limiting membranes of the endosymbiont-derived plastid-like organelle known as the apicoplast. Interestingly, during parasite replication in hepatocytes, the association of PbATG8 with the apicoplast increases as this organelle expands in size. PbATG3, PbATG7 and PbATG8 are cotranscribed in all parasitic stages. Molecular analysis of PbATG8 and PbATG3 revealed a novel mechanism of interaction compared with that observed for other orthologs. This is further supported by the inability of Plasmodium ATG8 to functionally complement atg8\u0394 yeast or localize to autophagosomes in starved mammalian cells.

Plasmodium parasites obtain fatty acids either by scavenging from the vertebrate host and mosquito vector or by producing fatty acids de novo via the type two fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FAS-II). Here, we study the FAS-II pathway in Plasmodium falciparum, the species responsible for the most lethal form of human malaria. Using antibodies, we find that the FAS-II enzyme FabI is expressed in mosquito midgut oocysts and sporozoites as well as liver-stage parasites but not during the blood stages. As expected, FabI colocalizes with the apicoplast-targeted acyl carrier protein, indicating that FabI functions in the apicoplast. We further analyze the FAS-II pathway in Plasmodium falciparum by assessing the functional consequences of deleting fabI and fabB/F. Targeted deletion or disruption of these genes in P. falciparum did not affect asexual blood-stage replication or the generation of midgut oocysts; however, subsequent sporozoite development was abolished. We conclude that the P. falciparum FAS-II pathway is essential for sporozoite development within the midgut oocyst.

We evaluated a series of triclosan analogues for their ability to inhibit the growth of Toxoplasma gondii, a pervasive human pathogen, and its ENR enzyme (TgENR). Several compounds that inhibited TgENR at low nanomolar concentrations were identified but could not be further differentiated because of the limited dynamic range of the TgENR activity assay. Thus, we adapted a thermal shift assay (TSA) to directly measure the dissociation constant (Kd) of the most potent inhibitors identified in this study as well as inhibitors from previous studies. Furthermore, the TSA allowed us to determine the mode of action of these compounds in the presence of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\u207a) cofactor. We found that all of the inhibitors bind to a TgENR-NAD\u207a complex but that they differed in their dependence on NAD\u207a concentration. Ultimately, we were able to identify compounds that bind to the TgENR-NAD\u207a complex in the low femtomolar range.

Nothing is known about the pathways that regulate gametocytogenesis and only few of the current drugs that inhibit asexual replication are also capable of inhibiting gametocyte development and blocking malaria transmission. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence indicating that the pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in Plasmodium falciparum membranes from host serine is essential for parasite gametocytogenesis and malaria transmission. Parasites lacking the phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase enzyme, which catalyzes the limiting step in this pathway, are severely altered in gametocyte development, are incapable of producing mature-stage gametocytes, and are not transmitted to mosquitoes. Chemical screening identified 11 inhibitors of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase that block parasite intraerythrocytic asexual replication and gametocyte differentiation in the low micromolar range. Kinetic studies in vitro as well as functional complementation assays and lipid metabolic analyses in vivo on the most promising inhibitor NSC-158011 further demonstrated the specificity of inhibition.

Gametocytes, which are essential for transmission, develop as sexual blood stage parasites in the human host over 8 to 12 days and are the most accessible developmental stage for transmission-blocking drugs. Considerable effort is currently being devoted to identifying compounds active against mature gametocytes. However, investigations on the drug sensitivity of developing gametocytes, as well as screening methods for identifying inhibitors of early gametocytogenesis, remain scarce. We have developed a luciferase-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using tightly synchronous stage I to III gametocytes from a recombinant P. falciparum line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-luciferase. The assay has been used to evaluate the early-stage gametocytocidal activity of the MMV Malaria Box, a collection of 400 compounds with known antimalarial (asexual blood stage) activity. Screening this collection against early-stage (I to III) gametocytes yielded 64 gametocytocidal compounds with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) below 2.5 \u03bcM. This assay is reproducible and suitable for the screening of large compound libraries, with an average percent coefficient of variance (%CV) of \u22645%, an average signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) of >30, and a Z' of \u223c0.8.

Current estimates place malaria mortality at over 650,000 individuals each year, mostly in African children. Efforts to reduce disease burden can benefit from the development of mathematical models of disease transmission. To date, however, comprehensive modeling of the parameters defining human infectivity to mosquitoes has remained elusive. Here, we describe a mechanistic within-host model of Plasmodium falciparum infection in humans and pathogen transmission to the mosquito vector. Our model incorporates the entire parasite lifecycle, including the intra-erythrocytic asexual forms responsible for disease, the onset of symptoms, the development and maturation of intra-erythrocytic gametocytes that are transmissible to Anopheles mosquitoes, and human-to-mosquito infectivity. These model components were parameterized from malaria therapy data and other studies to simulate individual infections, and the ensemble of outputs was found to reproduce the full range of patient responses to infection. Using this model, we assessed human infectivity over the course of untreated infections and examined the effects in relation to transmission intensity, expressed by the basic reproduction number R0 (defined as the number of secondary cases produced by a single typical infection in a completely susceptible population). Our studies predict that net human-to-mosquito infectivity from a single non-immune individual is on average equal to 32 fully infectious days. This estimate of mean infectivity is equivalent to calculating the human component of malarial R0 . We also predict that mean daily infectivity exceeds five percent for approximately 138 days.

Using the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei, we have explored the synthesis and scavenging pathways for lipoic acid, a short-chain fatty acid derivative that regulates the activity of \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenases including pyruvate dehydrogenase. In Plasmodium, lipoic acid is either synthesized de novo in the apicoplast or is scavenged from the host into the mitochondrion. Our data show that sporozoites lacking the apicoplast lipoic acid protein ligase LipB are markedly attenuated in their infectivity for mice, and in vitro studies document a very late liver stage arrest shortly before the final phase of intra-hepaticparasite maturation. LipB-deficient asexual blood stage parasites show unimpaired rates of growth in normal in vitro or in vivo conditions.

At the individual level, parasites evade the host immune responses through antigenic variation. At the global level, parasites escape drug pressure through single nucleotide variants and gene copy amplification events conferring drug resistance. Despite their importance to global health, the rates at which these genomic alterations emerge have not been determined. We studied the complete genomes of different Plasmodium falciparum clones that had been propagated asexually over one year in the presence and absence of drug pressure. A combination of whole-genome microarray analysis and next-generation deep resequencing (totaling 14 terabases) revealed a stable core genome with only 38 novel single nucleotide variants appearing in seventeen evolved clones (avg. 5.4 per clone). In clones exposed to atovaquone, we found cytochrome b mutations as well as an amplification event encompassing the P. falciparum multidrug resistance associated protein (mrp1) on chromosome 1. We observed 18 large-scale (>1 kb on average) deletions of telomere-proximal regions encoding multigene families, involved in immune evasion (9.5\u00d710(-6) structural variants per base pair per generation). Six of these deletions were associated with chromosomal crossovers generated during mitosis. We found only minor differences in rates between genetically distinct strains and between parasites cultured in the presence or absence of drug. Using these derived mutation rates for P. falciparum (1.0-9.7\u00d710(-9) mutations per base pair per generation), we can now model the frequency at which drug or immune resistance alleles will emerge under a well-defined set of assumptions. Further, the detection of mitotic recombination events in var gene families illustrates how multigene families can arise and change over time in P. falciparum.
