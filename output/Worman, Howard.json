Bax and Bak need to be activated, a process facilitated by the action of BH3-only pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. The latter either directly activates the effector proteins or antagonizes the action of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-xL. The nuclear envelope is a known target of the apoptotic machinery; however, it may also act as mediator of apoptosis. We showed previously that the nuclear envelope protein nesprin-2, a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, can bind to Bax in close proximity to the mitochondria and that the binding increases in apoptotic cells. We now show that depleting nesprin-2 inhibits the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway as measured by Bax and Bak activation and cytochrome c release. This survival effect was Bcl-xL-dependent. Nesprin-2 depletion also inhibited spontaneous exposure of the N-terminus of Bak in cells lacking Bcl-xL and increased the presence of Bcl-xL and Bax in the mitochondria. These results indicate that nesprin-2 promotes Bak activation and regulates mitochondrial translocation/retrotranslocation of Bcl-2 family proteins.

We developed a curated list of 502 genes for monogenic disorders associated with liver phenotypes and analyzed ES data for these genes in 758 patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). For comparison, we examined ES data in 7856 self-declared healthy controls (HC), and 2187 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Candidate pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were initially identified in 19.9% of participants, most of which were attributable to previously reported pathogenic variants with implausibly high allele frequencies. After variant annotation and filtering based on population minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-4 for dominant disorders and MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-3 for recessive disorders), we detected a significant enrichment of P/LP variants in the CLD cohort compared to the HC cohort (X2 test OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.06-8.18, p value\u2009=\u20094.5e-12). A second-level manual annotation was necessary to capture true pathogenic variants that were removed by stringent allele frequency and quality filters. After these sequential steps, the diagnostic rate of monogenic disorders was 5.7% in the CLD cohort, attributable to P/LP variants in 25 genes. We also identified concordant liver disease phenotypes for 15/22 kidney disease patients with P/LP variants in liver genes, mostly associated with cystic liver disease phenotypes. Sequencing results had many implications for clinical management, including familial testing for early diagnosis and management, preventative screening for associated comorbidities, and in some cases for therapy. Exome sequencing provided a 5.7% diagnostic rate in CLD patients and required multiple rounds of review to reduce both false positive and false negative findings.

human longevity increases, understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive aging becomes ever more critical to promote health and prevent age-related disorders. Premature aging disorders or progeroid syndromes can provide critical insights into aspects of physiological aging. A major cause of progeroid syndromes which result from mutations in the genes LMNA and ZMPSTE24 is disruption of the final posttranslational processing step in the production of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. LMNA encodes the lamin A precursor, prelamin A and ZMPSTE24 encodes the prelamin A processing enzyme, the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. Progeroid syndromes resulting from mutations in these genes include the clinically related disorders Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), mandibuloacral dysplasia-type B, and restrictive dermopathy. These diseases have features that overlap with one another and with some aspects of physiological aging, including bone defects resembling osteoporosis and atherosclerosis (the latter primarily in HGPS). The progeroid syndromes have ignited keen interest in the relationship between defective prelamin A processing and its accumulation in normal physiological aging. In this review, we examine the hypothesis that diminished processing of prelamin A by ZMPSTE24 is a driver of physiological aging. We review features a new mouse (LmnaL648R/L648R) that produces solely unprocessed prelamin A and provides an ideal model for examining the effects of its accumulation during aging. We also discuss existing data on the accumulation of prelamin A or its variants in human physiological aging, which call out for further validation and more rigorous experimental approaches to determine if prelamin A contributes to normal aging.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome", "Ste24", "ZMPSTE24", "farnesyl", "lamin", "mandibuloacral dysplasia", "nuclear envelope", "prelamin A", "restrictive dermopathy"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Lamin Type A", "Metalloendopeptidases", "Health Promotion", "Progeria", "Aging", "Membrane Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Howard J", "Last Name": "Worman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Michaelis", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}], "Journal": "Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "37547008", "Title": "Functional interaction of torsinA and its activators in liver lipid metabolism.", "Abstract": "TorsinA is an atypical ATPase that lacks intrinsic activity unless it is bound to its activators lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) in the perinuclear space or luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1) throughout the endoplasmic reticulum.

To better understand nuclear LDs that occur in\u00a0vivo, here we examined LDs in primary hepatocytes from mice following depletion of the nuclear envelope protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1). Microscopic image analysis showed that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes contain frequent nuclear LDs, which differ from cytoplasmic LDs in their associated proteins. We found type 1 nucleoplasmic reticula, which are invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane, are often associated with nuclear LDs in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo depletion of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C from mouse hepatocytes led to severely abnormal nuclear morphology, but significantly fewer nuclear LDs than were observed upon depletion of LAP1. In addition, we show both high-fat diet feeding and fasting of mice increased cytoplasmic lipids in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes but reduced nuclear LDs, demonstrating a relationship of LD formation with nutritional state. Finally, depletion of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein did not change the frequency of nuclear LDs in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes, suggesting that it is not required for the biogenesis of nuclear LDs in these cells.

Accumulation of the farnesylated prelamin A variant progerin, with an internal deletion including its processing site, causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Loss-of-function mutations in ZMPSTE24, which encodes the prelamin A processing enzyme, lead to accumulation of full-length farnesylated prelamin A and cause related progeroid disorders. Some data suggest that prelamin A also accumulates with physiological aging. Zmpste24-/- mice die young, at \u223c20 wk. Because ZMPSTE24 has functions in addition to prelamin A processing, we generated a mouse model to examine effects solely due to the presence of permanently farnesylated prelamin A. These mice have an L648R amino acid substitution in prelamin A that blocks ZMPSTE24-catalyzed processing to lamin A. The LmnaL648R/L648R mice express only prelamin and no mature protein. Notably, nearly all survive to 65 to 70 wk, with \u223c40% of male and 75% of female LmnaL648R/L648R mice having near-normal lifespans of 90 wk (almost 2 y).

They are caused by mutations in genes coding for A-type lamins or lamin-binding proteins. Here, we review how different mutations causing progeroid laminopathies alter protein structure or protein-protein interactions and how these impact on mechanisms that protect cell viability and function. One group of progeroid laminopathies, which includes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is characterized by accumulation of unprocessed prelamin A or variants. These are caused by mutations in the A-type lamin gene (LMNA), altering prelamin A itself, or in ZMPSTE24, encoding an endoprotease involved in its processing. The abnormally expressed farnesylated proteins impact on various cellular processes that may contribute to progeroid phenotypes. Other LMNA mutations lead to the production of nonfarnesylated A-type lamin variants with amino acid substitutions in solvent-exposed hot spots located mainly in coil 1B and the immunoglobulin fold domain. Dominant missense mutations might reinforce interactions between lamin domains, thus giving rise to excessively stabilized filament networks. Recessive missense mutations in A-type lamins and barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) causing progeroid disorders are found at the interface between these interacting proteins. The amino acid changes decrease the binding affinity of A-type lamins for BAF, which may contribute to lamina disorganization, as well as defective repair of mechanically induced nuclear envelope rupture.

This in turns leads to passive diffusion of cytosolic apoptogenic proteins, such as caspases and nucleases, through NPCs into the nucleus and the subsequent breakdown of the NE and destruction of the nucleus. However, NE leakiness at early stages of the apoptotic process can also occur in a caspase-independent manner, where Bax, by a non-canonical action, promotes transient and repetitive localized generation and subsequent rupture of nuclear protein-filled nuclear bubbles. This NE rupture leads to discharge of apoptogenic nuclear proteins from the nucleus to the cytosol, a process that can contribute to the death process. Therefore, the NE may play a role as mediator of cell death at early stages of apoptosis. The NE can also serve as a platform for assembly of complexes that regulate the death process.

We now show that cardiomyocytes from mice with an Lmna mutation and elevated cardiac ERK1/2 activity have altered nuclear positioning.

We confirmed genome-wide significant associations for hepatic cholesterol (chromosome 10A2) and serum total bile acid concentration (chromosome 12E) and identified a new locus for liver inflammation (chromosome 7C). Analysis of consomic mice confirmed that chromosome 12 A/J alleles accounted for the variance in serum total bile acid concentrations and had pleiotropic effects on liver mass, serum cholesterol, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Using an affected-only haplotype analysis among strains, we refined the chromosome 12E signal to a 1.95 Mb linkage disequilibrium block containing only one gene, sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (Sel1l).

Most mutations are nonsense or frameshift mutations that lead to the absence of emerin in cells. Only very few cases are due to missense or short in-frame deletions. Molecular mechanisms explaining the corresponding emerin variants' loss of function are particularly difficult to identify because of the mostly intrinsically disordered state of the emerin nucleoplasmic region. We now demonstrate that this EmN region can be produced as a disordered monomer, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance, but rapidly self-assembles in vitro. Increases in concentration and temperature favor the formation of long curvilinear filaments with diameters of approximately 10 nm, as observed by electron microscopy. Assembly of these filaments can be followed by fluorescence through Thioflavin-T binding and by Fourier-transform Infrared spectrometry through formation of \u03b2-structures. Analysis of the assembly properties of five EmN variants reveals that del95-99 and Q133H impact filament assembly capacities. In cells, these variants are located at the nuclear envelope, but the corresponding quantities of emerin-emerin and emerin-lamin proximities are decreased compared to wild-type protein. Furthermore, variant P183H favors EmN aggregation in vitro, and variant P183T provokes emerin accumulation in cytoplasmic foci in cells. Substitution of residue Pro183 might systematically favor oligomerization, leading to emerin aggregation and mislocalization in cells.

We find that randomly migrating C2C12 myoblasts orient their centrosomes in the direction of migration. Using wounded monolayers, we further show that centrosome orientation is stimulated by the serum factor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and involves the rearward movement of the nucleus while the centrosome is maintained at the cell centroid. The rate of nuclear movement correlated with that of actin retrograde flow and both cytochalasin D and blebbistatin prevented nuclear movement and centrosome orientation. Actin-dependent rearward nuclear movement in fibroblasts is mediated by assembly of nuclear membrane nesprin-2G and SUN2 LINC complexes into transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines anchored by A-type lamins and emerin. In C2C12 myoblasts, depletion of nesprin-2G, SUN2 or lamin A/C prevented nuclear movement and endogenous nesprin-2G and a chimeric GFP-mini-nesprin-2G formed TAN lines during nuclear movement. Depleting nesprin-2G strongly interfered with directed cell migration and reduced the efficiency of myoblast fusion into multinucleated myotubes.

Six genes have so far been linked to EDMD, four encoding proteins associated with the LINC complex that connects the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. However, 50% of patients have no identifiable mutations in these genes. Using a candidate approach, we have identified putative disease-causing variants in the SUN1 and SUN2 genes, also encoding LINC complex components, in patients with EDMD and related myopathies. Our data also suggest that SUN1 and SUN2 can act as disease modifier genes in individuals with co-segregating mutations in other EDMD genes. Five SUN1/SUN2 variants examined impaired rearward nuclear repositioning in fibroblasts, confirming defective LINC complex function in nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling.

These defects were recapitulated in C2C12 myotubes expressing exogenous SUN1 variants, demonstrating a direct link between SUN1 mutation and impairment of nuclear-microtubule coupling and myonuclear positioning.

These findings demonstrated that signaling defects that impair autophagy underlie pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy arising from LMNA mutation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Lamin Type A", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Point Mutation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason C", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard J", "Last Name": "Worman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Autophagy", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
