[{"PMID": "38663691", "Title": "iPSC-derived healthy human astrocytes selectively load miRNAs targeting neuronal genes into extracellular vesicles.", "Abstract": "Astrocytes are in constant communication with neurons during the establishment and maturation of functional networks in the developing brain. Astrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNA (miRNA) cargo that regulates transcript stability in recipient cells. Astrocyte released factors are thought to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. Healthy astrocytes partially rescue Rett Syndrome (RTT) neuron function. EVs isolated from stem cell progeny also correct aspects of RTT. EVs cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their cargo is found in peripheral blood which may allow non-invasive detection of EV cargo as biomarkers produced by healthy astrocytes. Here we characterize miRNA cargo and sequence motifs in healthy human astrocyte derived EVs (ADEVs). First, human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) were differentiated into Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) and subsequently into astrocytes using a rapid differentiation protocol. iPSC derived astrocytes expressed specific markers, displayed intracellular calcium transients and secreted ADEVs. miRNAs were identified by RNA-Seq on astrocytes and ADEVs and target gene pathway analysis detected brain and immune related terms. The miRNA profile was consistent with astrocyte identity, and included approximately 80 miRNAs found in astrocytes that were relatively depleted in ADEVs suggestive of passive loading. About 120 miRNAs were relatively enriched in ADEVs and motif analysis discovered binding sites for RNA binding proteins FUS, SRSF7 and CELF5. miR-483-5p was the most significantly enriched in ADEVs. This miRNA regulates MECP2 expression in neurons and has been found differentially expressed in blood samples from RTT patients. Our results identify potential miRNA biomarkers selectively sorted into ADEVs and implicate RNA binding protein sequence dependent mechanisms for miRNA cargo loading.", "Keywords": ["Astrocytes", "Blood biomarker", "Extracellular vesicles", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "RNA binding proteins", "Rett syndrome", "miR-483-5p", "microRNA"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "MicroRNAs", "Astrocytes", "Neurons", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Neural Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Gordillo-Sampedro", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Antounians", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Marat", "Last Name": "Mufteev", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Bas", "Last Name": "Lendemeijer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Femke M S", "Last Name": "de Vrij", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Center of Expertise for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ENCORE), Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Augusto", "Last Name": "Zani", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Ellis", "Affiliation": "Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, intergenerational transmission of risk for mental illness in one's children is insufficiently considered in clinical practice, nor is it sufficiently utilised into diagnostics and care for children of ill parents. This leads to delays in diagnosing young offspring and missed opportunities for protective actions and resilience strengthening. Prior twin, family, and adoption studies suggest that the aetiology of mental illness is governed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, potentially mediated by changes in epigenetic programming and brain development. However, how these factors ultimately materialise into mental disorders remains unclear. Here, we present the FAMILY consortium, an interdisciplinary, multimodal (e.g., (epi)genetics, neuroimaging, environment, behaviour), multilevel (e.g., individual-level, family-level), and multisite study funded by a European Union Horizon-Staying-Healthy-2021 grant. FAMILY focuses on understanding and prediction of intergenerational transmission of mental illness, using genetically informed causal inference, multimodal normative prediction, and animal modelling. Moreover, FAMILY applies methods from social sciences to map social and ethical consequences of risk prediction to prepare clinical practice for future implementation. FAMILY aims to deliver: (i) new discoveries clarifying the aetiology of mental illness and the process of resilience, thereby providing new targets for prevention and intervention studies; (ii) a risk prediction model within a normative modelling framework to predict who is at risk for developing mental illness; and (iii) insight into social and ethical issues related to risk prediction to inform

correlates of pyramidal cell axonal myelination in mouse and human neocortex.", "Abstract": "The axons of neocortical pyramidal neurons are frequently myelinated. Heterogeneity in the topography of axonal myelination in the cerebral cortex has been attributed to a combination of electrophysiological activity, axonal morphology, and neuronal-glial interactions. Previously, we showed that axonal segment length and caliber are critical local determinants of fast-spiking interneuron myelination. However, the factors that determine the myelination of individual axonal segments along neocortical pyramidal neurons remain largely unexplored. Here, we used structured illumination microscopy to examine the extent to which axonal morphology is predictive of the topography of myelination along neocortical pyramidal neurons. We identified critical thresholds for axonal caliber and interbranch distance that are necessary, but not sufficient, for myelination of pyramidal cell axons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Specifically, we found that pyramidal neuron axonal segments with a caliber\u2009<\u20090.24\u00a0\u03bcm or interbranch distance\u2009<\u200918.10\u00a0\u03bcm are rarely myelinated. Moreover, we further confirmed that these findings in mice are similar for human neocortical pyramidal cell myelination (caliber\u2009<\u20090.25\u00a0\u03bcm, interbranch distance\u2009<\u200919.00\u00a0\u03bcm), suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.

Similar differences were obtained in Syrian hamsters inoculated with D614G, Delta and the Omicron BA.1 variant 5\u00a0days post infection. Replication in the olfactory mucosa was observed in all hamsters, but most prominently in D614G inoculated hamsters.

We used the administrative health records of 481,657 U.S. individuals organized into 128,989 families. In addition, we employed rich geographically specific measures of air, water, and land quality across the United States. Using models of progressively increasing complexity, we examined both linear and non-linear contributions of genetic variation and environmental exposures to schizophrenia risk. Our results demonstrate that heritability estimates differ significantly when gene-environment interactions are included in the models, dropping from 79% for the simplest model, to 46% in the best-fit model which included the full set of linear and non-linear parameters.

Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NPR1) expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type III interferons and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS. IMPORTANCE Infections with the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are often associated with neurological complications. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via the olfactory nerve; however, SARS-CoV-2 is only rarely detected in the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect neurons of human iPSC neural cultures but that this infection is abortive and does not result in virus spread to other cells. However, infection of neural cultures did result in the production of type III interferon and IL-8. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS and infect individual neurons, triggering local immune responses that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS disease.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "H5N1 virus", "IL-8", "SARS-CoV-2", "coronavirus", "hiPSC neurons", "influenza A virus", "influenza virus", "interferon", "neurotropism"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Diseases", "COVID-19", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Dogs", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype", "Kinetics", "Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells", "Neurons", "SARS-CoV-2", "Vero Cells", "Viral Tropism", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bas", "Last Name": "Lendemeijer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Lonneke", "Last Name": "Leijten", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Carmen W E", "Last Name": "Embregts", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Rockx", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Femke M S", "Last Name": "de Vrij", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Debby", "Last Name": "van Riel", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2021Jun30"}, {"PMID": "34002096", "Title": "Genome-wide association study of more than 40,000 bipolar disorder cases provides new insights into the underlying biology.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 41,917 bipolar disorder cases and 371,549 controls of European ancestry, which identified 64 associated genomic loci. Bipolar disorder risk alleles were enriched in genes in synaptic signaling pathways and brain-expressed genes, particularly those with high specificity of expression in neurons of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Significant signal enrichment was found in genes encoding targets of antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics and anesthetics. Integrating expression quantitative trait locus data implicated 15 genes robustly linked to bipolar disorder via gene expression, encoding druggable targets such as HTR6, MCHR1, DCLK3 and FURIN. Analyses of bipolar disorder subtypes indicated high but imperfect genetic correlation between bipolar disorder type I and II and identified additional associated loci. Together, these results advance our understanding of the biological etiology of bipolar disorder, identify novel therapeutic leads and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bipolar Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromosomes, Human", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Phenotype", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Niamh", "Last Name": "Mullins", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. niamh.mullins@mssm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Andreas J", "Last Name": "Forstner", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine and University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kevin S", "Last Name": "O'Connell", "Affiliation": "Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Coombes", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan R I", "Last Name": "Coleman", "Affiliation": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Thomas D", "Last Name": "Als", "Affiliation": "iSEQ, Center for Integrative Sequencing, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Tim B", "Last Name": "Bigdeli", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sigrid", "Last Name": "B\u00f8rte", "Affiliation": "Research and Communication Unit for Musculoskeletal Health, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Bryois", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Alexander W", "Last Name": "Charney", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ole Kristian", "Last Name": "Drange", "Affiliation": "Department of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Gandal", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Science, Semel Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saskia P", "Last Name": "Hagenaars", "Affiliation": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Ikeda", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Nolan", "Last Name": "Kamitaki", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Science, Semel Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristi", "Last Name": "Krebs", "Affiliation": "Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia."}, {"First Name": "Georgia", "Last Name": "Panagiotaropoulou", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Brian M", "Last Name": "Schilder", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura G", "Last Name": "Sloofman", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stacy", "Last Name": "Steinberg", "Affiliation": "deCODE Genetics/Amgen, Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Vassily", "Last Name": "Trubetskoy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bendik S", "Last Name": "Winsvold", "Affiliation": "K.

through early childhood adversity: evidence for a gene-environment correlation.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that schizophrenia polygenic risk predicts a multitude of mental health problems in the general population. Yet it is unclear by which mechanisms these associations arise. Here, we explored a possible gene-environment correlation in the association of schizophrenia polygenic risk with mental health problems via childhood adversity. This study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study, including N\u2009=\u20091901 participants with genotyping for schizophrenia polygenic risk, maternal reporting of childhood adversity, and Child Behaviour Checklist measurement of mental health problems. Independent replication was attempted in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N\u2009=\u20093641). Associations were analysed with Poisson regression and statistical mediation analysis. Higher burden of schizophrenia polygenic risk was associated with greater exposure to childhood adversity (P-value threshold\u2009<\u20090.5: Generation R Study, OR\u2009=\u20091.08, 95%CI 1.02-1.15, P\u2009=\u20090.01; ALSPAC, OR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.03, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Childhood adversities partly explained the relationship of schizophrenia polygenic risk with emotional, attention, and thought problems (proportion explained, range 5-23%). Direct effects of schizophrenia polygenic risk and adversity on mental health outcomes were also observed. In summary, genetic liability to schizophrenia increased the risk for mental health problems in the general paediatric population through childhood adversity. Although this finding could result from a mediated causal relationship between genotype and mental health, we argue that these observations most likely reflect a gene-environment correlation, i.e. adversities are a marker for the genetic risk that parents transmit to children. These and similar recent findings raise important conceptual questions about preventative interventions aimed at reducing childhood adversities.", "Keywords": ["Generation R", "Gene\u2013environment", "Population-based", "Psychosis", "Stressful life events"], "MeSH terms": ["Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Mental Health", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Koen", "Last Name": "Bolhuis", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Lisa R", "Last Name": "Steenkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Laura M E", "Last Name": "Blanken", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Neumann", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Philip R", "Last Name": "Jansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Manon H J", "Last Name": "Hillegers", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Charlotte A M", "Last Name": "Cecil", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Henning", "Last Name": "Tiemeier", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. tiemeier@hsph.harvard.edu."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "European child & adolescent psychiatry", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "33555315", "Title": "miR-142-3p regulates cortical oligodendrocyte gene co-expression networks associated with tauopathy.", "Abstract": "Oligodendrocytes exist in a heterogenous state and are implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases including dementia. Cortical oligodendrocytes are a glial population uniquely positioned to play a key role in neurodegeneration by synchronizing circuit connectivity but molecular pathways specific to this role are lacking. We utilized oligodendrocyte-specific translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-seq (TRAP-seq) to transcriptionally profile adult mature oligodendrocytes from different regions of the central nervous system. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis reveals distinct region-specific gene networks. Two of these mature myelinating oligodendrocyte gene networks uniquely define cortical oligodendrocytes and differentially regulate cortical myelination (M8) and synaptic signaling (M4). These two cortical oligodendrocyte gene networks are enriched for genes associated with dementia including MAPT and include multiple gene targets of the regulatory microRNA, miR-142-3p. Using a combination of TRAP-qPCR, miR-142-3p overexpression in vitro, and miR-142-null mice, we show that miR-142-3p negatively regulates cortical myelination. In rTg4510 tau-overexpressing mice, cortical myelination is compromised, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is associated with gene co-expression networks that recapitulate both the M8 and M4 cortical oligodendrocyte gene networks identified from normal cortex.

However, the subcellular localization and relative abundance of these human UBE3A isoforms are unknown. We found, as previously reported in mice, that UBE3A is predominantly nuclear in human neurons. However, this conserved subcellular distribution is achieved by strikingly distinct cis-acting mechanisms. A single amino-acid deletion in the N-terminus of human hUBE3A-Iso3, which is homologous to cytosolic mouse mUBE3A-Iso2, results in its translocation to the nucleus. This singe amino-acid deletion is shared with apes and Old World monkeys and was preceded by the appearance of the cytosolic hUBE3A-Iso2 isoform. This hUBE3A-Iso2 isoform arose after the lineage of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys separated from the Tarsiers (Tarsiidae). Due to the loss of a single nucleotide in a non-coding exon, this exon became in frame with the remainder of the UBE3A protein. RNA-seq analysis of human brain samples showed that the human UBE3A isoforms arise by alternative splicing. Consistent with the predominant nuclear enrichment of UBE3A in human neurons, the two nuclear-localized isoforms, hUBE3A-Iso1 and -Iso3, are the most abundantly expressed isoforms of UBE3A, while hUBE3A-Iso2 maintains a small pool of cytosolic UBE3A.

We performed a second step trio-ES (not only focusing on genes involved in human disorders) analysis in 70 patients with negative results after solo-cES. All candidate variants were shared with a MatchMaking exchange system to identify additional patients carrying variants in the same genes and with similar phenotype. In 18/70 patients (26%), we confirmed causal implication of nine OMIM-morbid genes and identified nine new strong candidate genes (eight de novo and one compound heterozygous variants). These nine new candidate genes were validated through the identification of patients with similar phenotype and genotype thanks to data sharing. Moreover, 11 genes harbored variants of unknown significance in 10/70 patients (14%).

The objective of the present study was to determine whether the genetic risk of late-onset AD is related to premorbid individual differences in intelligence quotient (IQ) and characteristics of the cerebral white-matter in children. The study sample included children of the Generation R Study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands. IQ was measured using a well-validated Dutch nonverbal IQ test (n = 1908) at ages 5 to 9\u2009years. White-matter microstructure was assessed by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) of white-matter tracts using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (n = 919) at ages 9 to 12\u2009years. Genetic risk was quantified using three biologically defined genetic risk scores (GRSs) hypothesized to be related to the pathophysiology of late-onset AD: immune response, cholesterol/lipid metabolism and endocytosis. Higher genetic risk for late-onset AD that included genes associated with immune responsivity had a negative influence on cognition and cerebral white-matter microstructure. For each unit increase in the immune response GRS, IQ decreased by 0.259 SD (95% CI [-0.500, -0.017]). For each unit increase in the immune response GRS, global FA decreased by 0.373 SD (95% CI [-0.721, -0.026]).

This allows the identification of materials that enable primary cell attachment with high viability even under \"serum-free\" conditions, with materials that support both primary cells and neural progenitor cell attachment with high levels of neuronal biomarker expression, while promoting progenitor cell maturation to neurons.", "Keywords": ["central nervous system regeneration", "neuron cultures", "polymer microarrays", "progenitor cell maturation", "synthetic polymer substrates"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Laminin", "Mice", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Polymers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yichuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Kings Buildings, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3FJ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Seshasailam", "Last Name": "Venkateswaran", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Kings Buildings, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3FJ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gustavo A", "Last Name": "Higuera", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Suvra", "Last Name": "Nath", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Mekelweg 2, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Shpak", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Matray", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Mekelweg 2, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Lidy E", "Last Name": "Fratila-Apachitei", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Mekelweg 2, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Amir A", "Last Name": "Zadpoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Mekelweg 2, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomechanical Engineering, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Mekelweg 2, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Kings Buildings, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3FJ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Chris I", "Last Name": "De Zeeuw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "PubDate": "2020Feb"}, {"PMID": "31763980", "Title": "Novel genetic loci affecting facial shape variation in humans.", "Abstract": "The human face represents a combined set of highly heritable phenotypes, but knowledge on its genetic architecture remains limited, despite the relevance for various fields.

Enlargement of PV+ interneurons increased axonal myelination, while reduced cell size led to decreased myelination. Next, we considered regular-spiking SOM+ cells, which normally have relatively shorter interbranch distances and thinner axon diameters than PV+ cells, and are rarely myelinated. Consistent with the importance of axonal morphology for guiding interneuron myelination, enlargement of SOM+ cell size dramatically increased the frequency of myelinated axonal segments. Lastly, we confirm that these findings also extend to human neocortex by quantifying interneuron axonal myelination from ex vivo surgical tissue.

Fifty-seven healthy males were enrolled and randomized to oxytocin (N\u2009=\u200930) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200927).

Furthermore, using these robust cellular phenotypes, we implemented a small-molecule library screen with 2800 compounds and identified one small molecule capable of rescuing ER stress and cell proliferation in ZIP7-deficient cells in the low micromolar range.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cation Transport Proteins", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytosol", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Humans", "Zinc"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Christian G", "Last Name": "Bouwkamp", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Femke M", "Last Name": "de Vrij", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Lovenberg", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Pascal", "Last Name": "Bonaventure", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Anthony W", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Research and Development, San Diego, California (G.W., T.L., P.B., A.W.H.); and Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (C.G.B., F.M.V., S.A.K.) aharrin1@its.jnj.com."}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "29948232", "Title": "Long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of intrauterine exposure to lithium and antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Lithium and antipsychotics are often prescribed to treat bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders in women of childbearing age. Little is known about the consequences of these medications during pregnancy for the developing child. The objective of this article is to systematically review findings from preclinical and clinical studies that have examined the neurodevelopmental consequences of intrauterine exposure to lithium and antipsychotics. A systematic search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Clinical and experimental studies were selected if they investigated neurodevelopment of offspring exposed to lithium or antipsychotics during gestation. Quality of clinical and preclinical studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the SYRCLE's risk of Bias tool, respectively. In total, 73 studies were selected for qualitative synthesis and three studies were selected for quantitative synthesis. Of preclinical studies, 93% found one or more adverse effects of prenatal exposure to antipsychotics or lithium on neurodevelopment or behaviour. Only three clinical cohort studies have investigated the consequences of lithium exposure, all of which reported normal development. In 66% of clinical studies regarding antipsychotic exposure, a transient delay in neurodevelopment was observed. The relative risk for neuromotor deficits after in utero exposure to antipsychotics was estimated to be 1.63 (95% CI 1.22-2.19; I2\u2009=\u20090%). Preclinical studies suggest long-term adverse neurodevelopmental consequences of intrauterine exposure to either lithium or antipsychotics. However, there is a lack of high-quality clinical studies. Interpretation is difficult, since most studies have compared exposed children with their peers from the unaffected population, which did not allow correction for potential influences regarding genetic predisposition or parental psychiatric illness.", "Keywords": ["Antipsychotics", "Intrauterine exposure", "Lithium", "Neurodevelopment", "Pregnancy"], "MeSH terms": ["Antipsychotic Agents", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Lithium", "Male", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eline M P", "Last Name": "Poels", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. e.poels@erasmusmc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Lisanne", "Last Name": "Schrijver", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Astrid M", "Last Name": "Kamperman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Manon H J", "Last Name": "Hillegers", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Witte J G", "Last Name": "Hoogendijk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Sabine J", "Last Name": "Roza", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus University Medical Center, 's-Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "European child & adolescent psychiatry", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "29577077", "Title": "ACO2 homozygous missense mutation associated with complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia.", "Abstract": "To identify the clinical characteristics and genetic etiology of a family affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian G", "Last Name": "Bouwkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (C.G.B., S.R., F.M.S.d.V., S.A.K.) and Department of Clinical Genetics (C.G.B., M.Q., G.J.B., H.B.B., V.B.), Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;

Recent studies have shown that a substantial proportion of neocortical myelin content is contributed by fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether the myelination of PV+ interneurons is also modulated by intrinsic activity. Here, we used cell-type-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in adult mice to activate a sparse population of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) PV+ interneurons. Using single-cell axonal reconstructions, we found that DREADD-stimulated PV+ interneurons exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in total length of myelination, predominantly mediated by a parallel increase of axonal arborization and number of internodes. In contrast, the distribution of axonal interbranch segment distance and myelin internode length were not altered significantly. Topographical analysis revealed that myelination of DREADD-stimulated cells extended to higher axonal branch orders while retaining a similar interbranch distance threshold for myelination. Together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetically induced neuronal activity increases the myelination of neocortical PV+ interneurons mediated at least in part by an elaboration of their axonal morphology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Myelination is the wrapping of an axon to optimize conduction velocity in an energy-efficient manner. Previous studies have shown that myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is experience and activity dependent. We now show that activity-dependent myelin plasticity in the adult neocortex extends to parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) significantly enhanced axonal myelination, which was paralleled by an increase in axonal arborization. This suggests that activity-dependent axonal plasticity may involve changes in both structural morphology and myelination. Such multicomponent plasticity reveals an unexpected repertoire of anatomical parameters available for optimizing and adapting neuronal networks in response to experience.", "Keywords": ["axon", "interneuron", "myelination", "parvalbumin", "plasticity"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Interneurons", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myelin Sheath", "Parvalbumins", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Stedehouder", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Demi", "Last Name": "Brizee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Shpak", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands s.kushner@erasmusmc.nl."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Apr11"}, {"PMID": "29337119", "Title": "SOX10 Single Transcription Factor-Based Fast and Efficient Generation of\u00a0Oligodendrocytes from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "Abstract": "Scarce access to primary samples and lack of efficient protocols to generate oligodendrocytes (OLs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are hampering our understanding of OL biology and the development of novel therapies.

Among the most well-replicated findings in neurobiological studies of schizophrenia are deficits in myelination and white matter integrity; however, direct etiological genetic and cellular evidence has thus far been lacking. Here, we implement a family-based approach for genetic discovery in schizophrenia combined with functional analysis using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We observed familial segregation of two rare missense mutations in Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) (c.391G\u2009>\u2009A [p.A131T], MAF 7.79\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5 and c.2702T\u2009>\u2009G [p.V901G], MAF 2.51\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3). The CSPG4A131T mutation was absent from the Swedish Schizophrenia Exome Sequencing Study (2536 cases, 2543 controls), while the CSPG4V901G mutation was nominally enriched in cases (11 cases vs. 3 controls, P\u2009=\u20090.026, OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.05-13.52). CSPG4/NG2 is a hallmark protein of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). iPSC-derived OPCs from CSPG4A131T mutation carriers exhibited abnormal post-translational processing (P\u2009=\u20090.029), subcellular localization of mutant NG2 (P\u2009=\u20090.007), as well as aberrant cellular morphology (P\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), viability (P\u2009=\u20098.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), and myelination potential (P\u2009=\u20090.038). Moreover, transfection of healthy non-carrier sibling OPCs confirmed a pathogenic effect on cell survival of both the CSPG4A131T (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and CSPG4V901G (P\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4) mutations. Finally, in vivo diffusion tensor imaging of CSPG4A131T mutation carriers demonstrated a reduction of brain white matter integrity compared to unaffected sibling and matched general population controls (P\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5).

"Abstract": "The directed differentiation of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells into cell-type specific neurons has inspired the development of therapeutic discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. Many forms of ataxia result from degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, but thus far it has not been possible to efficiently generate Purkinje neuron (PN) progenitors from human or mouse pluripotent stem cells, let alone to develop a methodology for in vivo transplantation in the adult cerebellum. Here, we present a protocol to obtain an expandable population of cerebellar neuron progenitors from mouse embryonic stem cells. Our protocol is characterized by applying factors that promote proliferation of cerebellar progenitors. Cerebellar progenitors isolated in culture from cell aggregates contained a stable subpopulation of PN progenitors that could be expanded for up to 6 passages. When transplanted into the adult cerebellum of either wild-type mice or a strain lacking Purkinje cells (L7cre-ERCC1 knockout), GFP-labeled progenitors differentiated in vivo to establish a population of calbindin-positive cells in the molecular layer with dendritic trees typical of mature PNs. We conclude that this protocol may be useful for the generation and maturation of PNs, highlighting the potential for development of a regenerative medicine approach to the treatment of cerebellar neurodegenerative diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Age Factors", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebellum", "Culture Media", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression", "Genes, Reporter", "Immunophenotyping", "Male", "Mice", "Neural Stem Cells", "Purkinje Cells", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gustavo A", "Last Name": "Higuera", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. g.higuerasierra@erasmusmc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Grazia", "Last Name": "Iaffaldano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Meiwand", "Last Name": "Bedar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Shpak", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Broersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Shashini T", "Last Name": "Munshi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Dupont", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology & Reproduction, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Joost", "Last Name": "Gribnau", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology & Reproduction, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Femke M S", "Last Name": "de Vrij", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Chris I", "Last Name": "De Zeeuw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, NL-3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.dezeeuw@erasmusmc.nl."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2017Aug18"}, {"PMID": "28815211", "Title": "Phenotypic Differences between Asian and African Lineage Zika Viruses in Human Neural Progenitor Cells.", "Abstract": "Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have been associated with a range of neurological complications, in particular congenital microcephaly. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of microcephaly, and experimental ZIKV infection of hNPCs has been shown to induce cell death. However, the infection efficiency and rate of cell death have varied between studies, which might be related to intrinsic differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains. Therefore, we determined the replication kinetics, including infection efficiency, burst size, and ability to induce cell death, of two Asian and two African ZIKV strains. African ZIKV strains replicated to higher titers in Vero cells, human glioblastoma (U87MG) cells, human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells, and hNPCs than Asian ZIKV strains. Furthermore, infection with Asian ZIKV strains did not result in significant cell death early after infection, whereas infection with African ZIKV strains resulted in high percentages of cell death in hNPCs. The differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains highlight the importance of including relevant ZIKV strains to study the pathogenesis of congenital microcephaly and caution against extrapolation of experimental data obtained using historical African ZIKV strains to the current outbreak. Finally, the fact that Asian ZIKV strains infect only a minority of cells with a relatively low burst size together with the lack of early cell death induction might contribute to its ability to cause chronic infections within the central nervous system (CNS). IMPORTANCE The mechanism by which ZIKV causes a range of neurological complications, especially congenital microcephaly, is not well understood. The fact that congenital microcephaly is associated with Asian lineage ZIKV strains raises the question of why this was not discovered earlier. One possible explanation is that Asian and African ZIKV strains differ in their abilities to infect cells of the CNS and to cause neurodevelopmental problems. Here, we show that Asian ZIKV strains infect and induce cell death in human neural progenitor cells-which are important target cells in the development of congenital microcephaly-less efficiently than African ZIKV strains. These features of Asian ZIKV strains likely contribute to their ability to cause chronic infections, often observed in congenital microcephaly cases. It is therefore likely that phenotypic differences between ZIKV strains could be, at least in part, responsible for the ability of Asian ZIKV strains to cause congenital microcephaly.", "Keywords": ["African strains", "Asian strains", "Zika virus", "cell death", "growth kinetics", "human neural progenitor cells", "neuronal cells", "one-step growth curve", "pathogenesis", "phenotype"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatih", "Last Name": "Anfasa", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jurre Y", "Last Name": "Siegers", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "van der Kroeg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Noreen", "Last Name": "Mumtaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "V", "Last Name": "Stalin Raj", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Femke M S", "Last Name": "de Vrij", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "W", "Last Name": "Widagdo", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "G\u00fclsah", "Last Name": "Gabriel", "Affiliation": "Heinrich Pette Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Salinas", "Affiliation": "UMR1058, Pathogenesis and Control of Chronic Infections, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais Du Sang, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Yannick", "Last Name": "Simonin", "Affiliation": "UMR1058, Pathogenesis and Control of Chronic Infections, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais Du Sang, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Chantal", "Last Name": "Reusken", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Marion P G", "Last Name": "Koopmans", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bart", "Last Name": "Haagmans", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Byron E E", "Last Name": "Martina", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Debby", "Last Name": "van Riel", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2017Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "28735697", "Title": "Disentangling Heterogeneity of Childhood Disruptive Behavior Problems Into Dimensions and Subgroups.", "Abstract": "Irritable and oppositional behaviors are increasingly considered as distinct dimensions of oppositional defiant disorder.

is a complex neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of the paternal 15q11.2-q13 locus, due to deletion (DEL), maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD), or imprinting center defects. Individuals with mUPD have up to 60% risk of developing psychosis in early adulthood. Given the increasing evidence for white matter abnormalities in psychotic disorders, we investigated white matter microstructure in children and adolescents with PWS, with a particular emphasis on the DEL and mUPD subtypes. Magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images were acquired in 35 directions at 3T and analyzed using fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD) values obtained by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in 28 children and adolescents with PWS and 61 controls. In addition, we employed a recently developed white matter pothole approach, which does not require local FA differences to be spatially co-localized across subjects. After accounting for age and gender, individuals with PWS had significantly lower global FA and higher MD, compared with controls. Individuals with mUPD had lower FA in multiple regions including the corpus callosum, cingulate, and superior longitudinal fasciculus and larger potholes, compared with DEL and controls. The observed differences in individuals with mUPD are similar to the white matter abnormalities in individuals with psychotic disorders. Conversely, the subtle white matter abnormalities in individuals with DEL are consistent with their substantially lower risk of psychosis. Future studies to investigate the specific neurobiological mechanism underlying the differential psychosis risk between the DEL and mUPD subtypes of PWS are highly warranted.", "Keywords": ["15q11\u2013q13", "Prader\u2013Willi syndrome", "neurodevelopmental disorders", "psychosis", "structural connectivity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prader-Willi Syndrome", "Psychotic Disorders", "Risk", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akvile", "Last Name": "Lukoshe", "Affiliation": "Dutch Growth Research Foundation, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Gerbrich E", "Last Name": "van den Bosch", "Affiliation": "Intensive Care and Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Aad", "Last Name": "van der Lugt", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, Postbus 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Anita C", "Last Name": "Hokken-Koelega", "Affiliation": "Dutch Growth Research Foundation, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Tonya", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, Postbus 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "Schizophrenia bulletin", "PubDate": "2017Sep01"}, {"PMID": "28501739", "Title": "Risk of postpartum episodes in women with bipolar disorder after lamotrigine or lithium use during pregnancy: A population-based cohort study.", "Abstract": "Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk for relapse/recurrence postpartum.

HRas G12V/G12V mice showed robust upregulation of ERK signaling, neuronal hypertrophy, increased brain volume, spatial learning deficits, and impaired mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD). In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP), which is affected in other RASopathy mouse models was unaffected. Treatment with lovastatin, a HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor which has been shown to rescue the behavioral phenotypes of mouse models of NF1 and Noonan syndrome, was unable to restore ERK signaling and the cognitive deficits of HRas G12V/G12V mice. Administration of a potent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor rescued the ERK upregulation and the mGluR-LTD deficit of HRas G12V/G12V mice, but failed to rescue the cognitive deficits.

How synapses locally regulate protein homeostasis is poorly understood. We show that the presynaptic lipid phosphatase synaptojanin is required for macroautophagy, and this role is inhibited by the Parkinson's disease mutation R258Q. Synaptojanin drives synaptic endocytosis by dephosphorylating PI(4,5)P2, but this function appears normal in SynaptojaninRQ knock-in flies. Instead, R258Q affects the synaptojanin SAC1 domain that dephosphorylates PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, two lipids found in autophagosomal membranes. Using advanced imaging, we show that SynaptojaninRQ mutants accumulate the PI(3)P/PI(3,5)P2-binding protein Atg18a on nascent synaptic autophagosomes, blocking autophagosome maturation at fly synapses and in neurites of human patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Additionally, we observe neurodegeneration, including dopaminergic neuron loss, in SynaptojaninRQ flies.

Recent studies have implicated cerebellar pathology in the aetiology of ASD. Here we evaluate the possibility that cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) represent a critical locus of ASD-like pathophysiology in mice lacking Shank2. Absence of Shank2 impairs both PC intrinsic plasticity and induction of long-term potentiation at the parallel fibre to PC synapse.

To distinguish the contribution of female sex hormones and chromosomes to AT2R function and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated vasodilation, we made use of the four-core genotype model, where the testis-determining Sry gene has been deleted (Y(-)) from the Y chromosome, allowing XY(-) mice to develop a female gonadal phenotype. Simultaneously, by incorporating the Sry gene onto an autosome, XY(-)Sry and XXSry transgenic mice develop into gonadal male mice. Four-core genotype mice underwent a sham or gonadectomy (GDX) operation, and after 8 weeks, iliac arteries were collected to assess vascular function. XY(-)Sry male mice responded more strongly to angiotensin than XX female mice, and the AT2R antagonist PD123319 revealed that this was because of a dilator AT2R-mediated effect occurring exclusively in XX female mice. The latter could not be demonstrated in XXSry male and XY(-) female mice nor in XX female mice after GDX, suggesting that it depends on both sex hormones and chromosomes. Indeed, treating C57bl/6 GDX male mice with estrogen could not restore angiotensin-mediated, AT2R-dependent relaxation. To block acetylcholine-induced relaxation of iliac arteries obtained from four-core genotype XX mice, both endothelial NO synthase and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor inhibition were required, whereas in four-core genotype XY animals, endothelial NO synthase inhibition alone was sufficient. These findings were independent of gonadal sex and unaltered after GDX.

Here, we performed a systematic study to investigate the possibility that neurocognitive rescue can be achieved by reinstating Ube3a during earlier neurodevelopmental windows. We developed an AS model that allows for temporally controlled Cre-dependent induction of the maternal Ube3a allele and determined that there are distinct neurodevelopmental windows during which Ube3a restoration can rescue AS-relevant phenotypes. Motor deficits were rescued by Ube3a reinstatement in adolescent mice, whereas anxiety, repetitive behavior, and epilepsy were only rescued when Ube3a was reinstated during early development.

Little is known, however, about what interventions are most effective. The authors present treatment response and remission outcomes at 9 months postpartum using a four-step algorithm in patients with first-onset psychosis or mania in the postpartum period. Treatment involved the structured sequential administration of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, lithium, and ECT. The outcome of clinical remission was examined in 64 women consecutively admitted for postpartum psychosis. Remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and severe depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. Women who remitted on antipsychotic monotherapy were advised to continue this treatment as maintenance therapy, and women who required both antipsychotics and lithium to achieve remission were maintained on lithium monotherapy. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of any mood or psychotic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria. Using this treatment algorithm, the authors observed that nearly all patients (98.4%) achieved complete remission within the first three steps. None of the patients required ECT.

Isogenic groups of male and female mice establish linear social hierarchies that remain highly stable for at least 14 days, the longest interval tested. Remarkably, however, their social strategy is sex-specific: females primarily utilize intrinsic attributes, whereas males are strongly influenced by prior social experience. Using both genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we identify testosterone as a critical sex-specific factor for determining which social strategy is used. Males inheriting a null mutation of the sex-determining region Y (Sry) gene used a similar social cognitive strategy as females. In contrast, females with transgenic expression of Sry utilized a typically male social strategy. Analogously, castration of males and testosterone supplementation of females yielded similar outcomes, with a reversal of their social cognitive strategy. Together, our results demonstrate a sex-specific mechanism underlying social hierarchy, in which both males and females retain the functional capacity to adapt their social strategy.

One hypothesis is that CREB increases neuronal excitability to bias neuronal recruitment, although this has not been shown experimentally.

Kudzu plants and extracts have been used for 1,000 years in traditional Chinese medicine to treat alcoholism. Kudzu contains daidzin, which inhibits ALDH-2 and suppresses heavy drinking in rodents. Decreased drinking due to ALDH-2 inhibition is attributed to aversive properties of acetaldehyde accumulated during alcohol consumption. However not all of the anti-alcohol properties of diadzin are due to inhibition of ALDH-2. This is in agreement with our earlier work showing significant interaction effects of both pyrozole (ALDH-2 inhibitor) and methyl-pyrozole (non-inhibitor) and ethanol's depressant effects. Moreover, it has been suggested that selective ALDH 2 inhibitors reduce craving for alcohol by increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In addition there is significant evidence related to the role of the genetics of bitter receptors (TAS2R) and its stimulation as an aversive mechanism against alcohol intake. The inclusion of bitters such as Gentian & Tangerine Peel in Declinol provides stimulation of gut TAS2R receptors which is potentially synergistic with the effects of Kudzu. Finally the addition of Radix Bupleuri in the Declinol formula may have some protective benefits not only in terms of ethanol induced liver toxicity but neurochemical actions involving endorphins, dopamine and epinephrine. With this information as a rationale, we report herein that this combination significantly reduced Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores administered to ten heavy drinkers (M=8, F=2; 43.2 \u00b1 14.6 years) attending a recovery program. Specifically, from the pre-post comparison of the AUD scores, it was found that the score of every participant decreased after the intervention which ranged from 1 to 31. The decrease in the scores was found to be statistically significant with the p-value of 0.00298 (two-sided paired test; p-value = 0.00149 for one-sided test).

Although a cerebellar contribution to nonmotor functions has been supported by recent studies in human and monkey, it remains to be clarified with an in-depth, systematic approach in mouse mutants. Here we subjected four different cerebellar cell-specific mouse lines whereby the excitatory or inhibitory input to Purkinje cells (PCs) and/or PC postsynaptic plasticity were compromised, to a wide battery of standard cognitive and emotional tests. The four lines, which have all been shown to suffer from impaired motor learning without being ataxic, were tested for social behavior using a sociability task, for spatial navigation using the Morris watermaze, for fear responses using contextual and cued conditioning, and general anxiety using the open-field task. None of the four cerebellum-specific genetic perturbations showed significantly impaired cognitive or emotional behavior. In fact, even without correction for multiple comparisons, only 5 of 154 statistical comparisons showed a marginally significant deficit. Therefore, our data indicate that none of the perturbations of cerebellar functioning studied here affected the cognitive or emotional tests we used. This suggests that there may be a differential impact of the murine and human cerebellum on nonmotor functions. We hypothesize that these differences could be a consequence of the remarkable enlargement of the cerebellar hemispheres during the latest phase of vertebrate phylogeny, which occurred in parallel with the evolution of the cerebral cortex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Affective Symptoms", "Animals", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Cerebellum", "Cognition Disorders", "Conditioning, Psychological", "Exploratory Behavior", "Fear", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Psychomotor Performance", "Purkinje Cells", "Rotarod Performance Test", "Smell", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Galliano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus Medical Centre, 3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jan-Willem", "Last Name": "Potters", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ype", "Last Name": "Elgersma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Wisden", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chris I", "Last Name": "De Zeeuw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Freek E", "Last Name": "Hoebeek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Jul31"}, {"PMID": "23270599", "Title": "Immune system dysregulation in first-onset postpartum psychosis.", "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune system represents an important vulnerability factor for mood disorders. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe mood disorder occurring within 4 weeks after delivery, a period of heightened immune responsiveness and an altered endocrine set point.
