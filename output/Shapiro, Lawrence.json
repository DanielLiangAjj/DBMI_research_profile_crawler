To gain insight into the prevalent induction of these antibodies, we isolated and characterized 11 V2 apex-directed neutralizing antibody lineages from SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. Remarkably, all SHIV-induced V2 apex lineages were derived from reading frame two of the rhesus DH3-15*01 gene. Cryo-EM structures of envelope trimers in complex with antibodies from nine rhesus lineages revealed modes of recognition that mimicked three canonical human V2 apex-recognition modes. Notably, amino acids encoded by DH3-15*01 played divergent structural roles, inserting into a hole at the trimer apex, H-bonding to an exposed strand, or forming part of a loop scaffold. Overall, we identify a DH3-15*01-signature for rhesus V2 apex broadly neutralizing antibodies and show that highly selected genetic elements can play multiple roles in antigen recognition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan S", "Last Name": "Roark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rumi", "Last Name": "Habib", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew Jesse", "Last Name": "Connell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mattia", "Last Name": "Bonsignori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Hogarty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kirsten", "Last Name": "Sowers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frederic", "Last Name": "Bibollet-Ruche", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Callaghan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Carey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darcy R", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wanting", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosemarie D", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Younghoon", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juliette M", "Last Name": "Rando", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Wolff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Q Paula", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raiees", "Last Name": "Andrabi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin O", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Seaman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel W", "Last Name": "Kulp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Roederer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beatrice H", "Last Name": "Hahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun12"}, {"PMID": "38895375", "Title": "Cis inhibition of co-expressed DIPs and Dprs shapes neural development.", "Abstract": "In Drosophila , two interacting adhesion protein families, Dprs and DIPs, coordinate the assembly of neural networks.

We show, in cultured cells and in vivo, that DIP-\u03b1 and DIP-\u03b4 can interact in cis with their ligands, Dpr6/10 and Dpr12, respectively.

Clustered protocadherins (Pcdh), comprising a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, play a pivotal role in neuronal self-avoidance required for mammalian brain development5-7. The probabilistic expression of different Pcdh isoforms confers unique identities upon neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism exists in astrocytes, the other predominant cell type of the brain, remains unknown. Here, we report that a specific isoform in the Pcdh\u03b3 cluster, \u03b3C3, is highly enriched in human and murine astrocytes. Through genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that \u03b3C3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine if \u03b3C3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of \u03b3C3 chimeric proteins capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expressing complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same \u03b3C3 null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric \u03b3C3 proteins individually expressed in single \u03b3C3 null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition is essential for astrocyte development in the mammalian brain and that, by contrast to neuronal self-recognition, a single Pcdh isoform is both necessary and sufficient for this process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "S", "Last Name": "Zipursky", "Affiliation": "UCLA/HHMI."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "University of California Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "Alina", "Last Name": "Sergeeva", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Ahlsen", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Kerry", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Baljit", "Last Name": "Khakh", "Affiliation": "UCLA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "The University of Iowa."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2024Feb22"}, {"PMID": "37986867", "Title": "Allosteric Neutralization by Human H7N9 Antibodies.", "Abstract": "The avian influenza A virus H7N9 causes severe human infections with more than 30% fatality despite the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Currently there is no H7N9-specific prevention or treatment for humans. From a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case occurred in Hong Kong, we isolated four H7 hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by single B cell cloning, with three mAbs directed to the HA globular head domain (HA1) and one to the HA stem region (HA2). Two clonally related HA1-directed mAbs, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, potently neutralized H7N9 and protected mice from a lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge. Cryo-EM structures revealed that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bind to a \u03b214-centered surface partially overlapping with the antigenic site D of HA1 and disrupt the 220-loop that makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid on the adjacent protomer, thus affectively blocking viral entry. The more potent mAb H7.HK2 retained full HA1 binding and neutralization capacity to later H7N9 isolates from 2016-2017, which is consistent with structural data showing that the antigenic mutations of 2016-2017 from the 2013 H7N9 only occurred at the periphery of the mAb epitope. The HA2-directed mAb H7.HK4 lacked neutralizing activity but protected mice from the lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge when engineered to mouse IgG2a enabling Fc effector function in mice. Used in combination with H7.HK2 at a suboptimal dose, H7.HK4 augmented mouse protection.

The closely related Paramyxoviridae family includes parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). These three viral pathogens cause acute respiratory tract infections with substantial disease burden in the young, the elderly, and the immune-compromised. While promising subunit vaccines are being developed with prefusion-stabilized forms of the fusion glycoproteins (Fs) of RSV and PIVs, for which neutralizing titers elicited by the prefusion (pre-F) conformation of F are much higher than for the postfusion (post-F) conformation, with HMPV, pre-F and post-F immunogens described thus far elicit similar neutralizing responses, and it has been unclear which conformation, pre-F or post-F, would be the most effective HMPV F-vaccine immunogen. Here, we investigate the impact of further stabilizing HMPV F in the pre-F state. We replaced the furin-cleavage site with a flexible linker, creating a single chain F that yielded increased amounts of pre-F stabilized trimers, enabling the generation and assessment of F trimers stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds. Introduced prolines could increase both expression yields and antigenic recognition by the pre-F specific antibody, MPE8. The cryo-EM structure of a triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F trimer with the variable region of antibody MPE8 at 3.25-\u00c5 resolution confirmed the formation of designed disulfides and provided structural details on the MPE8 interface. Immunogenicity assessments in na\u00efve mice showed the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F trimer could elicit high titer neutralization, >10-fold higher than elicited by post-F. Immunogenicity assessments in pre-exposed rhesus macaques showed the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F could recall high neutralizing titers after a single immunization, with little discrimination in the recall response between pre-F and post-F immunogens. However, the triple disulfide-stabilized pre-F adsorbed HMPV-directed responses from commercially available pooled human immunoglobulin more fully than post-F.

The ectodomains of wild-type cadherins form a crystalline-like two-dimensional lattice in cell-cell interfaces mediated by both trans (apposed cell) and cis (same cell) interactions. In addition to these extracellular forces, adhesive strength is further regulated by cytosolic phenomena involving \u03b1 and \u03b2 catenin-mediated interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. Cell-cell adhesion can be further strengthened under tension through mechanisms that have not been definitively characterized in molecular detail. Here we quantitatively determine the role of the cadherin ectodomain in mechanosensing. To this end, we devise an E-cadherin-coated emulsion system, in which droplet surface tension is balanced by protein binding strength to give rise to stable areas of adhesion. To reach the honeycomb/cohesive limit, an initial emulsion compression by centrifugation facilitates E-cadherin trans binding, whereas a high protein surface concentration enables the cis-enhanced stabilization of the interface. We observe an abrupt concentration dependence on recruitment into adhesions of constant crystalline density, reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. Removing the lateral cis interaction with a \"cis mutant\" shifts this transition to higher surface densities leading to denser, yet weaker adhesions. In both proteins, the stabilization of progressively larger areas of deformation is consistent with single-molecule experiments that show a force-dependent lifetime enhancement in the cadherin ectodomain, which may be attributed to the \"X-dimer\" bond.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomimetics", "Emulsions", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Protein Binding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kartikeya", "Last Name": "Nagendra", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Training Program, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adrien", "Last Name": "Izzet", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas B", "Last Name": "Judd", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ruben", "Last Name": "Zakine", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Leah", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; D\u00e9partement de Physique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, PSL University, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "L\u00e9a-Laetitia", "Last Name": "Pontani", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire Jean Perrin, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jasna", "Last Name": "Brujic", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; Laboratoire de Physique et M\u00e9canique de Milieux H\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, UMR 7636, CNRS, ESPCI Paris-PSL, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, Paris, France.

We have isolated and characterized two human monoclonal antibodies, 12-16 and 12-19, which exhibited neutralizing activities against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. They also blocked infection in hamsters challenged with Omicron BA.1 intranasally. Structural analyses revealed both antibodies targeted a conserved quaternary epitope located at the interface between the N-terminal domain and subdomain 1, revealing a previously unrecognized site of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 spike. These antibodies prevent viral receptor engagement by locking the receptor-binding domain of spike in the down conformation, revealing a novel mechanism of virus neutralization for non-RBD antibodies. Deep mutational scanning showed that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate to escape 12-19, but the responsible mutations are rarely found in circulating viruses.

A major challenge to developing an efficacious vaccine is the extensive diversity of Plasmodium falciparum antigens. While genetic diversity plays a major role in immune evasion and is a barrier to the development of both natural and vaccine-induced protective immunity, it has been under-prioritized in the evaluation of malaria vaccine candidates. This study uses genomic approaches to evaluate genetic diversity in next generation malaria vaccine candidate PfRh5. We used targeted deep amplicon sequencing to identify non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PfRh5 (Reticulocyte-Binding Protein Homologue 5) in 189 P. falciparum positive samples from Southern Senegal and identified 74 novel SNPs. We evaluated the population prevalence of these SNPs as well as the frequency in individual samples and found that only a single SNP, C203Y, was present at every site. Many SNPs were unique to the individual sampled, with over 90% of SNPs being found in just one infected individual. In addition to population prevalence, we assessed individual level SNP frequencies which revealed that some SNPs were dominant (frequency of greater than 25% in a polygenomic sample) whereas most were rare, present at 2% or less of total reads mapped to the reference at the given position. Structural modeling uncovered 3 novel SNPs occurring under epitopes bound by inhibitory monoclonal antibodies, potentially impacting immune evasion, while other SNPs were predicted to impact PfRh5 structure or interactions with the receptor or binding partners. Our data demonstrate that PfRh5 exhibits greater genetic diversity than previously described, with the caveat that most of the uncovered SNPs are at a low overall frequency in the individual and prevalence in the population. The structural studies reveal that novel SNPs could have functional implications on PfRh5 receptor binding, complex formation, or immune evasion, supporting continued efforts to validate PfRh5 as an effective malaria vaccine target and development of a PfRh5 vaccine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Malaria Vaccines", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Antibodies, Protozoan", "Antigens, Protozoan", "Carrier Proteins", "Protozoan Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khadidiatou", "Last Name": "Mangou", "Affiliation": "G4 -

Moreover, in agreement with cryo-electron tomography studies, the zippers are found to organize into two-dimensional arrays even in the absence of attractive interactions between individual zippers.

The CCC in AJs forms junctional clusters, \"E clusters,\" driven by cis and trans interactions in the cadherin ectodomain and stabilized by \u03b1-catenin-actin interactions. Additional proteins are known to bind to the cytoplasmic region of the CCC. Here, we analyze how these CCC-associated proteins (CAPs) integrate into cadherin clusters and how they affect the clustering process. Using a cross-linking approach coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that the majority of CAPs, including the force-sensing protein vinculin, interact with CCCs outside of AJs. Accordingly, structural modeling shows that there is not enough space for CAPs the size of vinculin to integrate into E clusters. Using two CAPs, scribble and erbin, as examples, we provide evidence that these proteins form separate clusters, which we term \"C clusters.\" As proof of principle, we show, by using cadherin ectodomain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), that mAb-bound E-cadherin forms separate clusters that undergo trans interactions.

Despite these similarities, class members bind both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies using elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD-a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12\u00a0\u00c5. The VH1-2 antibody class, thus, uses modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with the VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and the CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "RBD", "SARS-CoV-2", "multi-donor antibody class", "neutralizing antibody", "quaternary recognition", "spike"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Variable Region", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Micah", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eswar R", "Last Name": "Reddem", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jude S", "Last Name": "Bimela", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana A", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seetha M", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Here we survey the mutational landscape of the vaccine-elicited anti-FP antibody, vFP16.02, to determine the genetic, structural, and functional features associated with antibody improvement or fitness. Using site-saturation mutagenesis and yeast display functional screening, we found that 1% of possible single mutations improved HIV-1 envelope trimer (Env) affinity, but generally comprised rare somatic hypermutations that may not arise frequently in vivo. We observed that many single mutations in the vFP16.02 Fab could enhance affinity >1,000-fold against soluble FP, although affinity improvements against the HIV-1 trimer were more measured and rare. The most potent variants enhanced affinity to both soluble FP and Env, had mutations concentrated in antibody framework regions, and achieved up to 37% neutralization breadth compared to 28% neutralization of the template antibody. Altered heavy- and light-chain interface angles and conformational dynamics, as well as reduced Fab thermal stability, were associated with improved HIV-1 neutralization breadth and potency. We also observed parallel sets of mutations that enhanced viral neutralization through similar structural mechanisms.

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization, and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation.

Probe regions include full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also design mutants that eliminate recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection range from \u223c0.5\u00a0mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5\u00a0mg/L for several subregions. Probes are characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe is determined by cryoelectron microscopy. We also characterize antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain probes.", "Keywords":

We describe here a novel mechanism that promotes sexually dimorphic neuronal function and synaptic connectivity in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that a phylogenetically conserved, but previously uncharacterized Doublesex/Mab-3 related transcription factor (DMRT), dmd-4, is expressed in two classes of sex-shared phasmid neurons specifically in hermaphrodites but not in males. We find dmd-4 to promote hermaphrodite-specific synaptic connectivity and neuronal function of phasmid sensory neurons. Sex-specificity of DMD-4 function is conferred by a novel mode of posttranslational regulation that involves sex-specific protein stabilization through ubiquitin binding to a phylogenetically conserved but previously unstudied protein domain, the DMA domain. A human DMRT homolog of DMD-4 is controlled in a similar manner, indicating that our findings may have implications for the control of sexual differentiation in other animals as well.", "Keywords": ["C. elegans", "neuroscience", "sexual dimorphism", "synapse pruning", "transcription factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Disorders of Sex Development", "Female", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Humans", "Male", "Neurons", "Sex Characteristics", "Synaptic Transmission", "Transcription Factors", "Ubiquitin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily A", "Last Name": "Bayer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca C", "Last Name": "Stecky", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Neal", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Ahlsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vishnu", "Last Name": "Balaji", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genetics and Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Thorsten", "Last Name": "Hoppe", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genetics and Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meital", "Last Name": "Oren-Suissa", "Affiliation": "Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Neurobiology, Rehovot, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2020Oct06"}, {"PMID": "32877670", "Title": "Identification and Structure of a Multidonor Class of Head-Directed Influenza-Neutralizing Antibodies Reveal the Mechanism for Its Recurrent Elicitation.", "Abstract": "Multidonor antibodies are of interest for vaccine design because they can in principle be elicited in the general population by a common set of immunogens.

Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth \u223c1 year later.

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to &gt;5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

neutralizing antibodies against multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike.", "Abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, with devasting consequences for human lives and the global economy1,2. The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9\u00a0ng\u00a0ml-1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

(RBDs) to engage the ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry. Antibodies can engage RBD but some, such as CR3022, fail to inhibit entry despite nanomolar spike affinity. Here we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have low unfolding enthalpy at serological pH and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where we observe significantly reduced CR3022 affinity. Cryo-EM structures -at serological and endosomal pH- delineated spike recognition of up to three ACE2 molecules, revealing RBD to freely adopt the 'up' conformation. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824-858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning and spike shedding of antibodies like CR3022. An endosomal mechanism involving spike-conformational change can thus facilitate immune evasion from RBD-'up'-recognizing antibody.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaroslav", "Last Name": "Tsybovsky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Olia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Micah A", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Cerutti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gwo-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Nazzari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jared M", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arne", "Last Name": "Schon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pengfei D", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jude", "Last Name": "Bimela", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "I-Ting", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey C", "Last Name": "Boyington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mallika", "Last Name": "Sastry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tyler", "Last Name": "Stephens", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Stuckey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shuishu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2020Jul31"}, {"PMID": "32596696", "Title": "Structure-Based Design with Tag-Based Purification and In-Process Biotinylation Enable Streamlined Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Molecular Probes.", "Abstract": "Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro , 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, \"all RBD-down\" conformation of the spike.

Antibody-based peptide interactions are often used to quantify yeast surface expression (e.g., by fusing a target protein to a FLAG, Myc, polyhistidine, or other peptide tag). However, antibody-antigen interactions require high stability for accurate quantification, and conventional tag systems based on such interactions may not be compatible with a low pH environment. In this study, a SNAP tag was introduced to a yeast display platform to circumvent disadvantages of conventional antibody display tags at low pH. SNAP forms a covalent bond with its small-molecule substrate, enabling precise and pH-independent protein display tagging. We compared the SNAP tag to conventional antibody-based peptide fusion and to direct fluorescent domain fusion using antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) gene libraries as a case study in low pH protein engineering. Our results demonstrated that covalent SNAP tags can effectively quantify protein-surface expression at low pH, enabling the enrichment of Fc variants with increased affinity at pH 6.0 to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).

We show that pAJ-linked bundles consist of two distinct regions-the bundle stalk (AJ-BS) and a tip (AJ-BT) positioned between cadherin clusters and the stalk. The tip differs from the stalk in a number of ways: it is devoid of the actin-bundling protein calponin, and exhibits a much faster F-actin turnover rate. While F-actin in the stalk displays centripetal movement, the F-actin in the tip is immobile. The F-actin turnover in both the tip and stalk is dependent on cadherin cluster stability, which in turn is regulated by F-actin. The close bidirectional coupling between the stability of cadherin and associated F-actin shows how pAJs, and perhaps other AJs, allow cells to sense and coordinate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in neighboring cells-a mechanism we term \"dynasensing.\"", "Keywords": ["actin", "adhesion", "cadherin"], "MeSH terms": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actins", "Adherens Junctions", "Cadherins", "Cell Line", "Humans", "Microfilament Proteins", "Models, Biological", "Subcellular Fractions"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Indrajyoti", "Last Name": "Indra", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regina B", "Last Name": "Troyanovsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

We find that internalized nectin-1-nectin-4 complexes follow the endocytic pathway. The nectin-1 cytoplasmic tail controls transfer: its deletion prevents trans-endocytosis, while its exchange with the nectin-4 tail reverses transfer direction. Nectin-1-expressing cells acquire dye-labeled cytoplasmic proteins synchronously with nectin-4, a process most active during cell adhesion. Some cytoplasmic cargo remains functional after transfer, as demonstrated with encapsidated genomes of measles virus (MeV). This virus uses nectin-4, but not nectin-1, as a receptor. Epithelial cells expressing nectin-4, but not those expressing another MeV receptor in its place, can transfer infection to nectin-1-expressing primary neurons. Thus, this newly discovered process can move cytoplasmic cargo, including infectious material, from epithelial cells to neurons. We name the process nectin-elicited cytoplasm transfer (NECT).

An essential feature of each hair cell is an array of filamentous tip links, consisting of the proteins protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), whose tension is thought to directly gate the cell's transduction channels. These links are considered far too stiff to represent the gating springs that convert hair bundle displacement into forces capable of opening the channels, and no mechanism has been suggested through which tip-link stiffness could be varied to accommodate hair cells of distinct frequency sensitivity in different receptor organs and animals. Consequently, the gating spring's identity and mechanism of operation remain central questions in sensory neuroscience. Using a high-precision optical trap, we show that an individual monomer of PCDH15 acts as an entropic spring that is much softer than its enthalpic stiffness alone would suggest. This low stiffness implies that the protein is a significant part of the gating spring that controls a hair cell's transduction channels. The tip link's entropic nature then allows for stiffness control through modulation of its tension. We find that a PCDH15 molecule is unstable under tension and exhibits a rich variety of reversible unfolding events that are augmented when the Ca2+ concentration is reduced to physiological levels. Therefore, tip link tension and Ca2+ concentration are likely parameters through which nature tunes a gating spring's mechanical properties.", "Keywords": ["auditory system", "entropic stiffness", "hair cell", "optical trap", "vestibular system"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Ear, Inner", "Elasticity", "HEK293 Cells", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Humans", "Mice", "Optical Tweezers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tobias F", "Last Name": "Bartsch", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065; tbartsch@rockefeller.edu hudspaj@rockefeller.edu."}, {"First Name": "Felicitas E", "Last Name": "Hengel", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Oswald", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Gilman", "Last Name": "Dionne", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Iris V", "Last Name": "Chipendo", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Simranjit S", "Last Name": "Mangat", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "El Shatanofy", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "M\u00fcller", "Affiliation": "The Solomon Snyder Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "A J", "Last Name": "Hudspeth", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065; tbartsch@rockefeller.edu hudspaj@rockefeller.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2019May28"}, {"PMID": "31004012", "Title": "Prolonged evolution of the memory B cell response induced by a replicating adenovirus-influenza H5 vaccine.", "Abstract": "Induction of an antibody response capable of recognizing highly diverse strains is a major obstacle to the development of vaccines for viruses such as HIV and influenza.

"Consistent elicitation of cross-clade HIV-neutralizing responses achieved in guinea pigs after fusion peptide priming by repetitive envelope trimer boosting.", "Abstract": "The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing responses is a central goal of HIV research. Recently, we elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses against the N terminus of the fusion peptide (FP), a critical component of the HIV-entry machinery. While the consistency of the elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses was good in mice, it was poor in guinea pigs: after seven immunizations comprising either envelope (Env) trimer or FP coupled to a carrier, serum from only one of five animals could neutralize a majority of a cross-clade panel of 19 wild-type strains. Such a low response rate-only 20%-made increasing consistency an imperative. Here, we show that additional Env-trimer immunizations could boost broad FP-directed neutralizing responses in a majority of immunized animals. The first boost involved a heterologous Env trimer developed from the transmitted founder clade C strain of donor CH505, and the second boost involved a cocktail that combined the CH505 trimer with a trimer from the BG505 strain. After boosting, sera from three of five animals neutralized a majority of the 19-strain panel and serum from a fourth animal neutralized 8 strains. We demonstrate that cross-reactive serum neutralization targeted the FP by blocking neutralization with soluble fusion peptide. The FP competition revealed two categories of elicited responses: an autologous response to the BG505 strain of high potency (~10,000 ID50), which was not competed by soluble FP, and a heterologous response of lower potency, which was competed by soluble FP. While the autologous response could increase rapidly in response to Env-trimer boost, the heterologous neutralizing response increased more slowly. Overall, repetitive Env-trimer immunizations appeared to boost low titer FP-carrier primed responses to detectable levels, yielding cross-clade neutralization. The consistent trimer-boosted neutralizing responses described here add to accumulating evidence for the vaccine utility of the FP site of HIV vulnerability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS

fundamental properties of all nervous systems1. These processes facilitate dendritic arborization2,3, prevent formation of autapses4 and allow free interaction among non-self neurons1,2,4,5. Avoidance among self neurites is mediated by stochastic cell-surface expression of combinations of about 60 isoforms of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-clustered protocadherin that provide mammalian neurons with single-cell identities1,2,4-13. Avoidance is observed between neurons that express identical protocadherin repertoires2,5, and single-isoform differences are sufficient to prevent self-recognition10. Protocadherins form isoform-promiscuous cis dimers and isoform-specific homophilic trans dimers10,14-20. Although these interactions have previously been characterized in isolation15,17-20, structures of full-length protocadherin ectodomains have not been determined, and how these two interfaces engage in self-recognition between neuronal surfaces remains unknown. Here we determine the molecular arrangement of full-length clustered protocadherin ectodomains in single-isoform self-recognition complexes, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron tomography. We determine the crystal structure of the clustered protocadherin \u03b3B4 ectodomain, which reveals a zipper-like lattice that is formed by alternating cis and trans interactions. Using cryo-electron tomography, we show that clustered protocadherin \u03b3B6 ectodomains tethered to liposomes spontaneously assemble into linear arrays at membrane contact sites, in a configuration that is consistent with the assembly observed in the crystal structure. These linear assemblies pack against each other as parallel arrays to form larger two-dimensional structures between membranes. Our results suggest that the formation of ordered linear assemblies by clustered protocadherins represents the initial self-recognition step in neuronal avoidance, and thus provide support for the isoform-mismatch chain-termination model of protocadherin-mediated self-recognition, which depends on these linear chains11.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Liposomes", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Neurons", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protocadherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kerry M", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex J", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Micah", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Venkata P", "Last Name": "Dandey", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Bepler", "Affiliation": "Computational and Systems Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clinton S", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. bh6@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. lss8@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019May"}, {"PMID": "30876875", "Title": "Longitudinal Analysis Reveals Early Development of Three MPER-Directed Neutralizing Antibody Lineages from an HIV-1-Infected Individual.", "Abstract": "Lineage-based vaccine design is an attractive approach for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1.

Here, we identify an HIV-infected donor with high-titer V2 peptide-binding antibodies and isolate two antibody lineages (CAP228-16H/19F and CAP228-3D) that mediate potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both lineages use the IGHV5-51 heavy chain germline gene, similar to the RV144 antibody CH58, but one lineage (CAP228-16H/19F) uses a light chain without the ED motif. A cocrystal structure of CAP228-16H bound to a V2 peptide identified a IGLV3-21 gene-encoded DDxD motif that is used to bind K169, with a mechanism that allows CAP228-16H to recognize more globally relevant V2 immunotypes.

In mice, these immunogens elicited monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing up to 31% of a cross-clade panel of 208 HIV-1 strains. Crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of these antibodies revealed fusion peptide conformational diversity as a molecular explanation for the cross-clade neutralization. Immunization of guinea pigs and rhesus macaques induced similarly broad fusion peptide-directed neutralizing responses, suggesting translatability.

Three distinct specificity groups emerge from our analysis with members that share highly similar heterophilic binding patterns and favor binding to one another. Structures of adhesive fragments from each specificity group confirm near-identical dimer topology conserved throughout the family, allowing interface residues whose conservation corresponds to specificity preferences to be identified.

Using single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that pAJs in these cells reach more than 1 \u03bcm in length and consist of several cadherin clusters with crystal-like density interspersed within sparser cadherin regions. Notably, extrajunctional cadherin appears to be monomeric, and its density is almost four orders of magnitude less than observed in the pAJ regions. Two alternative strategies of tracking cadherin motion within individual junctions show that pAJs undergo actin-dependent rapid-on the order of seconds-internal reorganizations, during which dense clusters disassemble and their cadherins are immediately reused for new clusters.

From an HIV-1-infected donor, #74, we identified antibody VRC-PG05, which neutralized 27% of HIV-1 strains. The crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC-PG05 in complex with gp120 revealed an epitope comprised primarily of N-linked glycans from N262, N295, and N448 at the silent face center.

Proteolytic footprinting showed that IgG4 from 95% of FS donor sera (19/20) recognized a 16-residue peptide (A129LNSMGQDLERPLELR144) from the EC1 domain of Dsg1 that overlaps the binding site for an adhesive-partner desmosomal cadherin molecule. Mutation of Dsg1 residues M133 and Q135 reduced the binding of FS IgG4 autoantibodies to Dsg1 by \u223c50%. Molecular modeling identified two nearby EC1 domain residues (Q82 and V83) likely to contribute to the epitope. Mutation of these residues completely abolished the binding of FS IgG4 to Dsg1. Bead aggregation assays showed that native binding interactions between Dsg1 and desmocollin 1 (Dsc1), which underlie desmosome structure, were abolished by Fab fragments of FS IgG4.

These O-Man glycans do not appear to be elongated like O-Man glycans found on \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG), and we recently demonstrated that initiation of cdh/protocadherin (pcdh) O-Man glycosylation is not dependent on the evolutionary conserved POMT1/POMT2 enzymes that initiate O-Man glycosylation on \u03b1-DG. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 genetic dissection strategy combined with sensitive and quantitative O-Man glycoproteomics to identify a homologous family of four putative protein O-mannosyltransferases encoded by the TMTC1-4 genes, which were found to be imperative for cdh and pcdh O-Man glycosylation. KO of all four TMTC genes in HEK293 cells resulted in specific loss of cdh and pcdh O-Man glycosylation, whereas combined KO of TMTC1 and TMTC3 resulted in selective loss of O-Man glycans on specific \u03b2-strands of EC domains, suggesting that each isoenzyme serves a different function. In addition, O-Man glycosylation of IPT/TIG domains of plexins and hepatocyte growth factor receptor was not affected in TMTC KO cells, suggesting the existence of yet another O-Man glycosylation machinery.

Previous studies have shown that the propensity to mutate is modulated by the context of surrounding nucleotides and that SHM machinery generates biased substitutions. To investigate the intrinsic mutation frequency and substitution bias of SHMs at the amino acid level, we analyzed functional human antibody repertoires and developed mGSSP (method for gene-specific substitution profile), a method to construct amino acid substitution profiles from next-generation sequencing-determined B cell transcripts. We demonstrated that these gene-specific substitution profiles (GSSPs) are unique to each V gene and highly consistent between donors. We also showed that the GSSPs constructed from functional antibody repertoires are highly similar to those constructed from antibody sequences amplified from non-productively rearranged passenger alleles, which do not undergo functional selection. This suggests the types and frequencies, or mutational space, of a majority of amino acid changes sampled by the SHM machinery to be well captured by GSSPs. We further observed the rates of mutational exchange between some amino acids to be both asymmetric and context dependent and to correlate weakly with their biochemical properties. GSSPs provide an improved, position-dependent alternative to standard substitution matrices, and can be utilized to developing software for accurately modeling the SHM process. GSSPs can also be used for predicting the amino acid mutational space available for antigen-driven selection and for understanding factors modulating the maturation pathways of antibody lineages in a gene-specific context. The mGSSP method can be used to build, compare, and plot GSSPs; we report the GSSPs constructed for 69 common human V genes (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511083) and provide high-resolution logo plots for each (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511085).", "Keywords": ["B cell ontogeny", "antibodyomics", "broadly neutralizing antibody", "mutation frequency", "repertoire diversity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28512129", "Title": "Mammalian O-mannosylation of cadherins and plexins is independent of protein O-mannosyltransferases 1 and 2.", "Abstract": "Protein O-mannosylation is found in yeast and metazoans, and a family of conserved orthologous protein O-mannosyltransferases is believed to initiate this important post-translational modification. We recently discovered that the cadherin superfamily carries O-linked mannose (O-Man) glycans at highly conserved residues in specific extracellular cadherin domains, and it was suggested that the function of E-cadherin was dependent on the O-Man glycans. Deficiencies in enzymes catalyzing O-Man biosynthesis, including the two human protein O-mannosyltransferases, POMT1 and POMT2, underlie a subgroup of congenital muscular dystrophies designated \u03b1-dystroglycanopathies, because deficient O-Man glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan disrupts laminin interaction with \u03b1-dystroglycan and the extracellular matrix. To explore the functions of O-Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins, we used a combinatorial gene-editing strategy in multiple cell lines to evaluate the role of the two POMTs initiating O-Man glycosylation and the major enzyme elongating O-Man glycans, the protein O-mannose \u03b2-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT1. Surprisingly, O-mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins does not require POMT1 and/or POMT2 in contrast to \u03b1-dystroglycan, and moreover, the O-Man glycans on cadherins are not elongated. Thus, the classical and evolutionarily conserved POMT O-mannosylation pathway is essentially dedicated to \u03b1-dystroglycan and a few other proteins, whereas a novel O-mannosylation process in mammalian cells is predicted to serve the large cadherin superfamily and other proteins.", "Keywords": ["cadherin", "dystroglycan", "glycomics", "glycosylation", "proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Dystroglycans", "Glycosylation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mannosyltransferases", "Nerve Tissue Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ida Signe Bohse", "Last Name": "Larsen", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Yoshiki", "Last Name": "Narimatsu", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Hiren Jitendra", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Sergey Y", "Last Name": "Vakhrushev", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Henrik", "Last Name": "Clausen", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Adnan", "Last Name": "Halim", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and halim@sund.ku.dk."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2017Jul07"}, {"PMID": "28445724", "Title": "Quantification of the Impact of the HIV-1-Glycan Shield on Antibody Elicitation.", "Abstract": "While the HIV-1-glycan shield is known to shelter Env from the humoral immune response, its quantitative impact on antibody elicitation has been unclear.

However, despite substantial efforts, no generally applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2=0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction. More generally, these results are encouraging with regard to the possibility of using an FEP approach to calculate the magnitude of protein-protein binding affinities.", "Keywords": ["alchemical FEP", "binding affinity optimization", "computational chemistry", "physics-based models", "protein structure prediction"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Computational Biology", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "Protein Binding", "Surface Plasmon Resonance", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatyana", "Last Name": "Gindin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lingle", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger Inc., 120 W 45th Street, New York, NY 10036, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger Inc., 120 W 45th Street, New York, NY 10036, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen S", "Last Name": "Murret", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina J", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, 1130 Street Nicholas Avenue, Room 815, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA.

The developmental pathway of 10E8 might therefore serve as a promising template for vaccine design, but samples from time-of-infection-often used to infer the B cell record-are unavailable. In this study, we used crystallography, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and functional assessments to infer the 10E8 developmental pathway from a single time point. Mutational analysis indicated somatic hypermutation of the 2nd-heavy chain-complementarity determining region (CDR H2) to be critical for neutralization, and structures of 10E8 variants with V-gene regions reverted to genomic origin for heavy-and-light chains or heavy chain-only showed structural differences >2 \u00c5 relative to mature 10E8 in the CDR H2 and H3. To understand these developmental changes, we used bioinformatic sieving, maximum likelihood, and parsimony analyses of immunoglobulin transcripts to identify 10E8-lineage members, to infer the 10E8-unmutated common ancestor (UCA), and to calculate 10E8-developmental intermediates. We were assisted in this analysis by the preservation of a critical D-gene segment, which was unmutated in most 10E8-lineage sequences. UCA and early intermediates weakly bound a 26-residue-MPER peptide, whereas HIV-1 neutralization and epitope recognition in liposomes were only observed with late intermediates. Antibody 10E8 thus develops from a UCA with weak MPER affinity and substantial differences in CDR H2 and H3 from the mature 10E8; only after extensive somatic hypermutation do 10E8-lineage members gain recognition in the context of membrane and HIV-1 neutralization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cell Line", "Complementarity Determining Regions", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp41", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Mutagenesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cinque", "Last Name": "Soto", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gilad", "Last Name": "Ofek", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Longo", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jinghe", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Parks", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Eudailey", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Krissey E", "Last Name": "Lloyd", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina United States of America."}, {"First Name": "S Munir", "Last Name": "Alam", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina United States of America."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27298358", "Title": "Structural basis of adhesive binding by desmocollins and desmogleins.", "Abstract": "Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions that impart strength to vertebrate tissues.

These findings show that Dsg:Dsc heterodimers represent the fundamental adhesive unit of desmosomes and provide a structural framework for understanding desmosome assembly.", "Keywords": ["cadherin", "cell adhesion", "desmosome", "heterophilic binding"], "MeSH terms": ["Adhesives", "Desmocollins", "Desmogleins", "Dimerization", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Protein Conformation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Gorka", "Last Name": "Lasso", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Ahlsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 bh6@cumc.columbia.edu shapiro@convex.hhmi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 bh6@cumc.columbia.edu shapiro@convex.hhmi.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Jun28"}, {"PMID": "27219002", "Title": "Correction: Targeted Isolation of Antibodies Directed against Major Sites of SIV Env Vulnerability.", "Abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005537.].", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rosemarie D", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hugh C", "Last Name": "Welles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cameron", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bimal K", "Last Name": "Chakrabarti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Lusvarghi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carole A", "Last Name": "Bewley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Wyatt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Roederer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "27191167", "Title": "Effects of Darwinian Selection and Mutability on Rate of Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Evolution during HIV-1 Infection.", "Abstract": "Accumulation of somatic mutations in antibody variable regions is critical for antibody affinity maturation, with HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) generally requiring years to develop. We recently found that the rate at which mutations accumulate decreases over time, but the mechanism governing this slowing is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether natural selection and/or mutability of the antibody variable region contributed significantly to observed decrease in rate. We used longitudinally sampled sequences of immunoglobulin transcripts of single lineages from each of 3 donors, as determined by next generation sequencing. We estimated the evolutionary rates of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which are most significant for functional selection, and found they evolved about 1.5- to 2- fold faster than the framework regions. We also analyzed the presence of AID hotspots and coldspots at different points in lineage development and observed an average decrease in mutability of less than 10 percent over time. Altogether, the correlation between Darwinian selection strength and evolutionary rate trended toward significance, especially for CDRs, but cannot fully explain the observed changes in evolutionary rate. The mutability modulated by AID hotspots and coldspots changes correlated only weakly with evolutionary rates. The combined effects of Darwinian selection and mutability contribute substantially to, but do not fully explain, evolutionary rate change for HIV-1-targeting bnAb lineages.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibody Affinity", "Complementarity Determining Regions", "Computational Biology", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes, Immunoglobulin", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Variable Region", "Longitudinal Studies", "Models, Genetic", "Models, Immunological", "Mutation", "Selection, Genetic", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Center for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "27161523", "Title": "Structural Basis of Diverse Homophilic Recognition by Clustered \u03b1- and \u03b2-Protocadherins.", "Abstract": "Clustered protocadherin proteins (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-Pcdhs) provide a high level of cell-surface diversity to individual vertebrate neurons, engaging in highly specific homophilic interactions to mediate important roles in mammalian neural circuit development.

In this study we describe the use of a competitive probe binding sort strategy as well as scaffolded probes for targeted isolation of SIV Env-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We isolated nearly 70 SIV-specific mAbs directed against major sites of SIV Env vulnerability analogous to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) targets of HIV-1, namely, the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), CD4-induced (CD4i)-site, peptide epitopes in variable loops 1, 2 and 3 (V1, V2, V3) and potentially glycan targets of SIV Env. The range of SIV mAbs isolated includes those exhibiting varying degrees of neutralization breadth and potency as well as others that demonstrated binding but not neutralization. Several SIV mAbs displayed broad and potent neutralization of a diverse panel of 20 SIV viral isolates with some also neutralizing HIV-2(7312A). This extensive panel of SIV mAbs will facilitate more effective use of the SIV non-human primate (NHP) model for understanding the variables in development of a HIV vaccine or immunotherapy.",

Structures of lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages in epitope focusing, length-of-time to develop breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hypermutation suggested commonalities in maturation among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the required CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared substantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2.

vaccine, but this has not yet been achieved by immunization. In contrast, some HIV-1-infected individuals naturally mount bNAb responses during chronic infection, suggesting that years of maturation may be required for neutralization breadth. Recent studies have shown that viral diversification precedes the emergence of bNAbs, but the significance of this observation is unknown. Here we delineate the key viral events that drove neutralization breadth within the CAP256-VRC26 family of 33 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from a superinfected individual. First, we identified minority viral variants, termed bNAb-initiating envelopes, that were distinct from both of the transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses and that efficiently engaged the bNAb precursor. Second, deep sequencing revealed a pool of diverse epitope variants (immunotypes) that were preferentially neutralized by broader members of the antibody lineage. In contrast, a 'dead-end' antibody sublineage unable to neutralize these immunotypes showed limited evolution and failed to develop breadth. Thus, early viral escape at key antibody-virus contact sites selects for antibody sublineages that can tolerate these changes, thereby providing a mechanism for the generation of neutralization breadth within a developing antibody lineage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antigenic Variation", "Epitopes", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Neutralization Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "RNA, Viral", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Superinfection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinal N", "Last Name": "Bhiman", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Doria-Rose", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen", "Last Name": "Karimanzira", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thandeka", "Last Name": "Khoza", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Dale", "Last Name": "Kitchin", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Botha", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nigel J", "Last Name": "Garrett", "Affiliation": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Salim S", "Last Name": "Abdool Karim", "Affiliation": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn", "Last Name": "Williamson", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Penny L", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26290581", "Title": "E-cadherin junction formation involves an active kinetic nucleation process.", "Abstract": "Epithelial (E)-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play important roles in the development and maintenance of tissue structure in multicellular organisms.

This interaction resulted in the formation of numerous short-lived cortex-bound \u03b1ABD clusters.

We use nonhuman primates to investigate the relationship in the early stage of chronic SHIVAD8 (simian-human immunodeficiency virus AD8) infection between envelope (Env)-specific TFH cells, Env-specific B cells, virus, and the generation of bNAbs during later infection. We found that both the frequency and quality of Env-specific TFH cells were associated with an expansion of Env-specific immunoglobulin G-positive GC B cells and broader neutralization across HIV clades. We also found a correlation between breadth of neutralization and the degree of somatic hypermutation in Env-specific memory B cells.

To understand how antibodies achieve such neutralization, we isolated CD4-binding-site (CD4bs) antibodies and analyzed 16 co-crystal structures -8 determined here- of CD4bs antibodies from 14 donors. The 16 antibodies segregated by recognition mode and developmental ontogeny into two types: CDR H3-dominated and VH-gene-restricted. Both could achieve greater than 80% neutralization breadth, and both could develop in the same donor. Although paratope chemistries differed, all 16 gp120-CD4bs antibody complexes showed geometric similarity, with antibody-neutralization breadth correlating with antibody-angle of approach relative to the most effective antibody of each type. The repertoire for effective recognition of the CD4 supersite thus comprises antibodies with distinct paratopes arrayed about two optimal geometric orientations, one achieved by CDR H3 ontogenies and the other achieved by VH-gene-restricted ontogenies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "B-Lymphocytes", "CD4 Antigens",

Here, we characterize the rate of maturation and extent of diversity for the lineage that produced the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 through longitudinal sampling of peripheral B cell transcripts over 15 years and co-crystal structures of lineage members. Next-generation sequencing identified VRC01-lineage transcripts, which encompassed diverse antibodies organized into distinct phylogenetic clades. Prevalent clades maintained characteristic features of antigen recognition, though each evolved binding loops and disulfides that formed distinct recognition surfaces. Over the course of the study period, VRC01-lineage clades showed continuous evolution, with rates of \u223c2 substitutions per 100 nucleotides per year, comparable to that of HIV-1 evolution. This high rate of antibody evolution provides a mechanism by which antibody lineages can achieve extraordinary diversity and, over years of chronic infection, develop effective HIV-1 neutralization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibody Diversity", "B-Lymphocytes", "Chronic Disease", "Evolution, Molecular", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA;

Small changes in sequence are found to produce subtle structural and dynamical changes that impact relative affinities, in part via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and in part through entropic effects because of increased conformational heterogeneity in the bound states as revealed by DEER distance mapping in the dimers. These findings highlight the remarkable ability of evolution to exploit a wide range of molecular properties to produce closely related members of the same protein family that have affinity differences finely tuned to mediate their biological roles.", "Keywords": ["cadherin dimerization", "entropy contribution", "protein family design"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Binding, Competitive", "Cadherins", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Kinetics", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Static Electricity", "Xenopus", "Xenopus Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeremie", "Last Name": "Vendome", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Klara", "Last Name": "Felsovalyi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Hang", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Zhongyu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jules Stein Eye Institute and."}, {"First Name": "Xiangshu", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Goran", "Last Name": "Ahlsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Kaczynska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology."}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Darwin", "Last Name": "Edmond", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195;

A theoretical analysis reveals that assembly of Pcdh isoforms into multimeric recognition units and the observed tolerance for mismatched isoforms can generate cell surface diversity sufficient for single-cell identity.

These antibodies can protect against lentiviral infection in nonhuman primates (NHPs), suggesting that passive antibody transfer would prevent HIV-1 transmission in humans. To increase the protective efficacy of such monoclonal antibodies, we employed next-generation sequencing, computational bioinformatics, and structure-guided design to enhance the neutralization potency and breadth of VRC01, an antibody that targets the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 envelope. One variant, VRC07-523, was 5- to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, neutralized 96% of viruses tested, and displayed minimal autoreactivity. To compare its protective efficacy to that of VRC01 in vivo, we performed a series of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge experiments in nonhuman primates and calculated the doses of VRC07-523 and VRC01 that provide 50% protection (EC50). VRC07-523 prevented infection in NHPs at a 5-fold lower concentration than VRC01.

HIV-1 V1V2-directed neutralizing antibodies can thus develop relatively rapidly through initial selection of B cells with a long CDR H3, and limited subsequent somatic hypermutation.

To test whether HR possesses HDM activity, we performed a series of in vitro demethylation assays, which demonstrated that HR can demethylate monomethylated or dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1 or me2). Moreover, ectopic expression of wild-type HR, but not JmjC-mutant HR, led to pronounced demethylation of H3K9 in cultured human HeLa cells. We also show that two missense mutations in HR, which we and others described in patients with atrichia with papular lesions, abolished the demethylase activity of HR, demonstrating the role of HR demethylase activity in human disease. By ChIP-Seq analysis, we identified multiple new HR target genes, many of which play important roles in epidermal development, neural function, and transcriptional regulation, consistent with the predicted biological functions of HR.

We previously characterized the VRC01 class of antibodies, which target the CD4-binding site on gp120, appear in multiple donors, and broadly neutralize HIV-1. Antibodies of this class have developmental commonalities, but typically share only \u223c50% amino acid sequence identity among different donors. Here we apply next-generation sequencing to identify VRC01 class antibodies in a new donor, C38, directly from B cell transcript sequences. We first tested a lineage rank approach, but this was unsuccessful, likely because VRC01 class antibody sequences were not highly prevalent in this donor. We next identified VRC01 class heavy chains through a phylogenetic analysis that included thousands of sequences from C38 and a few known VRC01 class sequences from other donors. This \"cross-donor analysis\" yielded heavy chains with little sequence homology to previously identified VRC01 class heavy chains. Nonetheless, when reconstituted with the light chain from VRC01, half of the heavy chain chimeric antibodies showed substantial neutralization potency and breadth. We then identified VRC01 class light chains through a five-amino-acid sequence motif necessary for VRC01 light chain recognition. From over a million light chain sequences, we identified 13 candidate VRC01 class members. Pairing of these light chains with the phylogenetically identified C38 heavy chains yielded functional antibodies that effectively neutralized HIV-1. Bioinformatics analysis can thus directly identify functional HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies of the VRC01 class from a sequenced antibody repertoire.", "Keywords": ["DNA sequencing", "antibodyomics", "cross-donor phylogenetic analysis", "humoral immune response", "sequence signature"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "Base Sequence", "Genetic Variation", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center and NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cinque", "Last Name": "Soto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph P", "Last Name": "Casazza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Oct22"}, {"PMID": "24067646", "Title": "Mechanism of E-cadherin dimerization probed by NMR relaxation dispersion.", "Abstract": "Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), a member of the classical cadherin family, mediates calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Crystal structures of classical cadherins reveal an adhesive dimer interface featuring reciprocal exchange of N-terminal \u03b2-strands between two protomers. Previous work has identified a putative intermediate (called the \"X-dimer\") in the dimerization pathway of wild-type E-cadherin EC1-EC2 domains, based on crystal structures of mutants not capable of strand swapping and on deceleration of binding kinetics by mutations at the X-dimer interface. In the present work, NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is used to directly observe and characterize intermediate states without the need to disrupt the strand-swapped binding interface by mutagenesis. The results indicate that E-cadherin forms strand-swapped dimers predominantly by a mechanism in which formation of a weak and short-lived X-dimer-like state precedes the conformational changes required for formation of the mature strand-swapped dimeric structure. Disruption of this intermediate state through mutation reduces both association and dissociation rates by factors of ~10(4), while minimally perturbing affinity. The X-dimer interface lowers the energy barrier associated with strand swapping and enables E-cadherins to form strand-swapped dimers at a rate consistent with residence times in adherens junctions.", "Keywords": ["binding mechanism", "domain swapping", "protein-protein interaction"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Dimerization", "Fluorescence", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Edward S.

Here we determine the ontogeny of the VRC01 class by crystallography and next-generation sequencing.

These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Africa", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "CD4 Antigens", "Cell Lineage", "Cells, Cultured", "Clone Cells", "Cross Reactions", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Epitopes", "Evolution, Molecular", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Neutralization Tests", "Phylogeny", "Protein Structure, Tertiary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hua-Xin", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Duke University Human Vaccine Institute, Departments of Medicine and Immunology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. hliao@duke.edu"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S Munir", "Last Name": "Alam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Boyd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew Z", "Last Name": "Fire", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krishna M", "Last Name": "Roskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chaim A", "Last Name": "Schramm", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhenhai", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S", "Last Name": "Gnanakaran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Hraber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Wiehe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Garnett", "Last Name": "Kelsoe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shi-Mao", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Montefiori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Parks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krissey E", "Last Name": "Lloyd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Scearce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Soderberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myron", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gift", "Last Name": "Kamanga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lillian M", "Last Name": "Tran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fangping", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sheri", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Moquin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiulian", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Gordon", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sanjay", "Last Name": "Srivatsan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anqi", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beatrice H", "Last Name": "Hahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas B", "Last Name": "Kepler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bette T M", "Last Name": "Korber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Apr25"}, {"PMID": "23536288", "Title": "Mining the antibodyome for HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies with next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic pairing of heavy/light chains.", "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts from HIV-1-infected individuals with broadly neutralizing antibodies could provide an efficient means for identifying somatic variants and characterizing their lineages. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing and identity/divergence grid sampling to analyze heavy- and light-chain sequences from donor N152, the source of the broadly neutralizing antibody 10E8. We identified variants with up to 28% difference in amino acid sequence. Heavy- and light-chain phylogenetic trees of identified 10E8 variants displayed similar architectures, and 10E8 variants reconstituted from matched and unmatched phylogenetic branches displayed significantly lower autoreactivity when matched. To test the generality of phylogenetic pairing, we analyzed donor International AIDS Vaccine Initiative 84, the source of antibodies PGT141-145. Heavy- and light-chain phylogenetic trees of PGT141-145 somatic variants also displayed remarkably similar architectures; in this case, branch pairings could be anchored by known PGT141-145 antibodies. Altogether, our findings suggest that phylogenetic matching of heavy and light chains can provide a means to approximate natural pairings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "HIV-1", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neutralization Tests", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gilad", "Last Name": "Ofek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark K", "Last Name": "Louder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krisha", "Last Name": "McKee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Pancera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Skinner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhenhai", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Parks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Eudailey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krissey E", "Last Name": "Lloyd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Blinn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S Munir", "Last Name": "Alam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barton F", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Simek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dennis R", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wayne C", "Last Name": "Koff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NISC Comparative Sequencing Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Mullikin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Apr16"}]
