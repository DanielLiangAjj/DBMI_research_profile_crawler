Here we show that the corn snake uses a Sox2-Sox9 developmental tool kit common to other species to generate and shape the lung in two phases. Initially Sox9 was found at low levels at the tip of the primary lung bud during outgrowth and elongation of the bronchial bud, without driving branching programs characteristic of mammalian lungs. Later, Sox9 induction is recapitulated in the formation of an extensive network of radial septae emerging along the elongated bronchial bud that generates the respiratory region.

major components of the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations, collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pools, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Finally, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans.

Thus far, the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs. The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, Trp63CreERT2 and KRT5-CreERT2-labeled ectopic EBCs do not exhibit alveolar regeneration potential. Intriguingly, when tamoxifen was administrated post-viral infection, Trp63CreERT2 but not KRT5-CreERT2 labels islands of alveolar epithelial cells that are negative for EBC biomarkers. Furthermore, germline deletion of Trpm5 significantly increases the contribution of Trp63CreERT2-labeled cells to the alveolar epithelium.

We show that Prominin 1 (Prom1), a transmembrane protein widely used as stem cell marker, is crucial to this process. During airway differentiation, Prom1 becomes restricted to multiciliated cells, where it is expressed at distinct levels along the proximal-distal axis of the airways. Prom1 is induced by Notch in multiciliated cells, and Notch inactivation abolishes this gradient of expression. Prom1 was not required for multicilia formation, but when inactivated resulted in longer cilia that beat at a lower frequency.

Methods: We analyzed two independent datasets of serum retinol levels with self-reported ethnicities and the differences of allele frequencies of the SNPs associated with vitamin A metabolism between groups in publicly available datasets. Results: Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic pregnant women showed high VAD prevalence in both datasets.

We show that preterm NP progenitors have a markedly distinct molecular signature of abnormal proliferation and mitochondria quality control compared to term progenitors. Preterm progenitors had lower oxygen consumption at baseline and were unable to ramp up consumption to the levels of term cells when challenged. Although they formed a mucociliary epithelium, ciliary function tended to decline in premature cells as they differentiated, compared to term cells.

Although extensively studied in Drosophila and in cell cultures, major gaps of knowledge still remain on how this pathway functions in mammalian systems. The pathway consists of a growing number of components, including core kinases and adaptor proteins, which control the subcellular localization of the transcriptional co-activators Yap and Taz through phosphorylation of serines at key sites. When localized to the nucleus, Yap/Taz interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce transcriptional programs of proliferation, stemness, and growth. In the cytoplasm, Yap/Taz interact with multiple pathways to regulate a variety of cellular functions or are targeted for degradation. The Hippo pathway receives cues from diverse intracellular and extracellular inputs, including growth factor and integrin signaling, polarity complexes, and cell-cell junctions.

Accordingly, EC-specific deletion of the CCN1 gene in mice mimics a YAP gain-of-function phenotype, characterized by EC hyperproliferation and blood vessel enlargement.

In a previous study, we demonstrated a synergistic negative effect of pre- and postnatal exposure to PM2.5 on lung development in mice. However, the means by which air pollution affects development of the lung have not yet been identified. In this study, we exposed pregnant BALB/c mice and their offspring to concentrated urban PM2.5 (from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; target dose 600\u202f\u03bcg/m3 for 1\u202fh daily). Exposure was started on embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5, time of placental implantation). Lung tissue of fetuses and offspring was submitted to stereological and transcriptomic analyses at E14.5 (pseudoglandular stage of lung development), E18.5 (saccular stage) and P40 (postnatal day 40, alveolarized lung). Additionally, lung function and cellularity of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were studied in offspring animals at P40. Compared to control animals that were exposed to filtered air throughout gestation and postnatal life, PM-exposed mice exhibited higher lung elastance and a lower alveolar number at P40 whilst the total lung volume and cellularity of BAL fluid were not affected. Glandular and saccular structures of fetal lungs were not altered upon gestational exposure; transcriptomic signatures, however, showed changes related to DNA damage and its regulation, inflammation and regulation of cell proliferation. A differential expression was validated at E14.5 for the candidates Sox8, Angptl4 and Gas1. Our data substantiate the in utero biomolecular effect of gestational exposure to air pollution and provide first-time stereological evidence that pre- and early life-postnatal exposure compromise lung development, leading to a reduced number of alveoli and an impairment of lung function in the adult mouse.", "Keywords": ["Air pollution", "Alveolarization", "Lung development", "Particulate matter", "Transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Air Pollution", "Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4", "Animals", "Brazil", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "DNA Damage", "Elasticity", "Female", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Particulate Matter", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Pulmonary Alveoli", "SOXE Transcription Factors", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thais", "Last Name": "de Barros Mendes Lopes", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Experimental Air Pollution (LIM05), Department of Pathology, Faculdade de Medicina FMUSP, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Av.

organizing centres for initiation of centriole amplification during multiciliogenesis.", "Abstract": "Abnormal development of multiciliated cells is a hallmark of a variety of human conditions associated with chronic airway diseases, hydrocephalus and infertility. Multiciliogenesis requires both activation of a specialized transcriptional program and assembly of cytoplasmic structures for large-scale centriole amplification that generates basal bodies. It remains unclear, however, what mechanism initiates formation of these multiprotein complexes in epithelial progenitors. Here we show that this is triggered by nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the transcription factor E2f4. After inducing a transcriptional program of centriole biogenesis, E2f4 forms apical cytoplasmic organizing centres for assembly and nucleation of deuterosomes. Using genetically altered mice and E2F4 mutant proteins we demonstrate that centriole amplification is crucially dependent on these organizing centres and that, without cytoplasmic E2f4, deuterosomes are not assembled, halting multiciliogenesis. Thus, E2f4 integrates nuclear and previously unsuspected cytoplasmic events of centriole amplification, providing new perspectives for the understanding of normal ciliogenesis, ciliopathies and cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Animals", "Autoantigens", "Basal Bodies", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Centrioles", "Cilia", "Cytoplasm", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "E2F4 Transcription Factor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Munemasa", "Last Name": "Mori", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Allergy Critical Care, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Renin", "Last Name": "Hazan", "Affiliation": "David H.

The conference objectives were to review the current understanding of the role of stem and progenitor cells in lung repair after injury and to review the current status of cell therapy and ex vivo bioengineering approaches for lung diseases. These are all rapidly expanding areas of study that both provide further insight into and challenge traditional views of mechanisms of lung repair after injury and pathogenesis of several lung diseases. The goals of the conference were to summarize the current state of the field, discuss and debate current controversies, and identify future research directions and opportunities for both basic and translational research in cell-based therapies for lung diseases. This 10th anniversary conference was a follow up to five previous biennial conferences held at the University of Vermont in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013.

To identify novel putative markers of CCs and explore the origins of CC diversity, we characterized global changes in gene expression in embryonic lungs in which CCs do not form due to conditional disruption of Notch signaling (Rbpjk(CNULL)). Microarray profiling, Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR), and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) identified eleven genes downregulated in the E18.5 airways of Rbpjk(cnull) compared to controls, nearly half not previously known to mark CCs. ISH revealed that several genes had overlapping but distinct domains of expression of in the normal developing lung (E18.5). Notably, Reg3g, Chad, Gabrp and Lrrc26 were enriched in proximal airways, Hp in the distal airways and Upk3a in clusters of cells surrounding Neuroepithelial Bodies (NEBs). Seven of the eleven genes, including Reg3g, Hp, and Upk3a, were expressed in the adult lung in CCs in a pattern similar to that observed in the developing airways. qRT-PCR-based analysis of gene expression of CCs isolated from different airway regions of B1-EGFP reporter mice corroborated the spatial enrichment in gene expression observed by ISH. Our study identifies candidate markers for CC-precursors and CCs and supports the idea that the diversification of the CC phenotype occurs already during embryonic development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Epithelial Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "In Situ Hybridization", "Lung", "Mice", "Microarray Analysis", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arjun", "Last Name": "Guha", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Vasconcelos", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America ; Pulmonary and Critical Care Unit, Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Gower", "Affiliation": "Boston University Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jayaraj", "Last Name": "Rajagopal", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America ; Pulmonary and Critical Care Unit, Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wellington V", "Last Name": "Cardoso", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24401276", "Title": "Prenatal retinoid deficiency leads to airway hyperresponsiveness in adult mice.", "Abstract": "There is increasing evidence that vitamin A deficiency in utero correlates with abnormal airway smooth muscle (SM) function in postnatal life. The bioactive vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) is essential for formation of the lung primordium; however, little is known about the impact of early fetal RA deficiency on postnatal lung structure and function. Here, we provide evidence that during murine lung development, endogenous RA has a key role in restricting the airway SM differentiation program during airway formation. Using murine models of pharmacological, genetic, and dietary vitamin A/RA deficiency, we found that disruption of RA signaling during embryonic development consistently resulted in an altered airway SM phenotype with markedly increased expression of SM markers. The aberrant phenotype persisted postnatally regardless of the adult vitamin A status and manifested as structural changes in the bronchial SM and hyperresponsiveness of the airway without evidence of inflammation. Our data reveal a role for endogenous RA signaling in restricting SM differentiation and preventing precocious and excessive SM differentiation when airways are forming.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchial Hyperreactivity", "Bronchoconstrictor Agents", "Cell Differentiation", "Diet", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Lung", "Methacholine Chloride", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle, Smooth", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Phenotype", "Pregnancy", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin", "Vitamin A", "Vitamin A Deficiency"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Felicia", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hector", "Last Name": "Marquez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youn-Kyung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fengzhi", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Fine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William W", "Last Name": "Cruikshank", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Loredana", "Last Name": "Quadro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wellington V", "Last Name": "Cardoso", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23798474", "Title": "Diffuse lung disease in children: summary of a scientific conference.", "Abstract": "A multi-disciplinary scientific conference focused on diffuse and interstitial lung diseases in children was held in La Jolla, CA in June 2012.

The molecular pathways that regulate this complex process are beginning to be defined, and such knowledge is critical to our understanding of congenital and acquired lung diseases. A recent workshop was convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to discuss the developmental principles that regulate the formation of the pulmonary system. Emerging evidence suggests that key developmental pathways not only regulate proper formation of the pulmonary system but are also reactivated upon postnatal injury and repair and in the pathogenesis of human lung diseases. Molecular understanding of early lung development has also led to new advances in areas such as generation of lung epithelium from pluripotent stem cells. The workshop was organized into four different topics, including early lung cell fate and morphogenesis, mechanisms of lung cell differentiation, tissue interactions in lung development, and environmental impact on early lung development. Critical points were raised, including the importance of epigenetic regulation of lung gene expression, the dearth of knowledge on important mesenchymal lineages within the lung, and the interaction between the developing pulmonary and cardiovascular system.
