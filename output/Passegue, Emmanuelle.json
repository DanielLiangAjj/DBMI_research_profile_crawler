[{"PMID": "38754428", "Title": "Autophagy counters inflammation-driven glycolytic impairment in aging hematopoietic stem cells.", "Abstract": "Autophagy is central to the benefits of longevity signaling programs and to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) response to nutrient stress. With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves regenerative capacity, but the signals triggering autophagy and maintaining the functionality of autophagy-activated old HSCs (oHSCs) remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is an adaptive cytoprotective response to chronic inflammation in the aging murine bone marrow (BM) niche. We find that inflammation impairs glucose uptake and suppresses glycolysis in oHSCs through Socs3-mediated inhibition of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling, with inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserving functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we show that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glycolytic flux and significantly boosts oHSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset oHSC regenerative capacity.", "Keywords": ["aging", "autophagy", "hematopoietic stem cells", "inflammation", "metabolism", "regeneration"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul V", "Last Name": "Dellorusso", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa A", "Last Name": "Proven", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fernando J", "Last Name": "Calero-Nieto", "Affiliation": "Welcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, Cambridge University, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Puddicombe Way, Cambridge CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Xiaonan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Welcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, Cambridge University, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Puddicombe Way, Cambridge CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Carl A", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Felix", "Last Name": "Hartmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meelad", "Last Name": "Amouzgar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Favaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "DeVilbiss", "Affiliation": "Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "James W", "Last Name": "Swann", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Theodore T", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiyu", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean C", "Last Name": "Bendall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Berthold", "Last Name": "G\u00f6ttgens", "Affiliation": "Welcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, Cambridge University, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Puddicombe Way, Cambridge CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuelle", "Last Name": "Passegu\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

However, the molecular drivers of immunosuppressive myeloid cell states are not well defined. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing of human and mouse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lesions, and found that in both species the type 2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) was predicted to be the primary driver of the tumour-infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophage phenotype. Using a panel of conditional knockout mice, we found that only deletion of the IL-4 receptor IL-4R\u03b1 in early myeloid progenitors in bone marrow reduced tumour burden, whereas deletion of IL-4R\u03b1 in downstream mature myeloid cells had no effect. Mechanistically, IL-4 derived from bone marrow basophils and eosinophils acted on granulocyte-monocyte progenitors to transcriptionally programme the development of immunosuppressive tumour-promoting myeloid cells. Consequentially, depletion of basophils profoundly reduced tumour burden and normalized myelopoiesis. We subsequently initiated a clinical trial of the IL-4R\u03b1 blocking antibody dupilumab2-5 given in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade in patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC who had progressed on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05013450 ). Dupilumab supplementation reduced circulating monocytes, expanded tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells, and in one out of six patients, drove a near-complete clinical response two months after treatment. Our study defines a central role for IL-4 in controlling immunosuppressive myelopoiesis in cancer, identifies a novel combination therapy for immune checkpoint blockade in humans, and highlights cancer as a systemic malady that requires therapeutic strategies beyond the primary disease site.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Bone Marrow",

Autophagy is central for the benefits associated with activation of longevity signaling programs ( 2 ), and for HSC function and response to nutrient stress ( 3,4 ). With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves some regenerative capacity, while the rest fail to engage autophagy and become metabolically overactivated and dysfunctional ( 4 ). However, the signals that promote autophagy in old HSCs and the mechanisms responsible for the increased regenerative potential of autophagy-activated old HSCs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy activation is an adaptive survival response to chronic inflammation in the aging bone marrow (BM) niche ( 5 ). We find that inflammation impairs glucose metabolism and suppresses glycolysis in aged HSCs through Socs3-mediated impairment of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling. In this context, we show that inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserves functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we demonstrate that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glucose uptake and glycolytic flux and significantly improves old HSC regenerative potential.

This activation phase leads to many intrinsic stresses such as replicative, metabolic, and oxidative stress, which can cause functional decline, impaired self-renewal, and exhaustion of HSCs. To cope with these insults, HSCs use both built-in and emergency-triggered stress-response mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and to defend against disease development.

Utilizing a novel sorting strategy, we isolated highly purified promyelocyte populations from normal and young preleukemic animals, carried out microarray and methylation profiling analyses, and compared the results from the two groups of animals. Surprisingly, in the absence of secondary lesions, PML/RARA had an overall limited impact on both the transcriptome and methylome. Of interest, we did identify down-regulation of secondary and tertiary granule genes as the first step engaging the myeloid maturation block. Although initially not sufficient to arrest terminal granulopoiesis in vivo, such alterations set the stage for the later, complete differentiation block seen in leukemia. Further, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that PML/RARA promyelocytes exhibit a subtle increase in expression of cell cycle genes, and we show that this leads to both increased proliferation of these cells and expansion of the promyelocyte compartment. Importantly, this proliferation signature was absent from the poorly leukemogenic p50/RARA fusion model, implying a critical role for PML in the altered cell-cycle kinetics and ability to initiate leukemia. Thus, our findings challenge the predominant model in the field and we propose that PML/RARA initiates leukemia by subtly shifting cell fate decisions within the promyelocyte compartment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD34", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Cluster Analysis", "DNA Methylation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic", "Granulocyte Precursor Cells", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Oncogene Proteins, Fusion", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Coline", "Last Name": "Gaillard", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA Institut Universitaire d'H\u00e9matologie, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."}, {"First Name": "Taku A", "Last Name": "Tokuyasu", "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Core, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Galit", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Sotzen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adeline", "Last Name": "Vitaliano-Prunier", "Affiliation": "Institut Universitaire d'H\u00e9matologie, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."}, {"First Name": "Ritu", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Core, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuelle", "Last Name": "Passegu\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hugues", "Last Name": "de Th\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Institut Universitaire d'H\u00e9matologie, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."}, {"First Name": "Maria E", "Last Name": "Figueroa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott C", "Last Name": "Kogan", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA scott.Kogan@ucsf.edu."}], "Journal": "Haematologica", "PubDate": "2015Aug"}, {"PMID": "25753524", "Title": "Identification of FOXM1 as a therapeutic target in B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.", "Abstract": "Despite recent advances in the cure rate of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the prognosis for patients with relapsed ALL remains poor.

Production of these cells results from activation of a myeloid differentiation program in bone marrow (BM) by a novel mechanism in which tumor-derived granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) directs expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells to skew hematopoiesis toward the myeloid lineage. Chronic skewing of myeloid production occurred in parallel to a decrease in erythropoiesis in BM in mice with progressive disease.

While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated \u03b3H2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar \u03b3H2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs.

Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Caloric Restriction", "Cell Survival", "Cellular Senescence", "Cytokines", "Energy Metabolism", "Food Deprivation", "Forkhead Box Protein O3", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Homeostasis", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Warr", "Affiliation": "The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mikhail", "Last Name": "Binnewies", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Flach", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Damien", "Last Name": "Reynaud", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Trit", "Last Name": "Garg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ritu", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jayanta", "Last Name": "Debnath", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emmanuelle", "Last Name": "Passegu\u00e9", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Feb21"}, {"PMID": "23290130", "Title": "Metabolic makeover for HSCs.", "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must at times exit quiescence to divide and produce differentiated blood cells.
