Biochemical studies revealed that direct binding of the IRES to the 40S ribosomal subunit places the initiation codon into the P site, where it base pairs with eIF2-bound Met-tRNAiMet forming a 48S initiation complex. Subsequently, eIF5 and eIF5B mediate subunit joining, yielding an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. Initiation can also proceed without eIF2, in which case Met-tRNAiMet is recruited directly by eIF5B. However, the structures of initiation complexes assembled on the HCV IRES, the transitions between different states, and the accompanying conformational changes have remained unknown. To fill these gaps, we now obtained cryo-EM structures of IRES initiation complexes, at resolutions up to 3.5\u2009\u00c5, that cover all major stages from the initial ribosomal association, through eIF2-containing 48S initiation complexes, to eIF5B-containing complexes immediately prior to subunit joining.

Allosteric modulation of the CaS receptor corrects disorders of calcium homeostasis. Here, we report the cryogenic-electron microscopy reconstructions of a near-full-length CaS receptor in the absence and presence of allosteric modulators. Activation of the homodimeric CaS receptor requires a break in the transmembrane 6 (TM6) helix of each subunit, which facilitates the formation of a TM6-mediated homodimer interface and expansion of homodimer interactions. This transformation in TM6 occurs without a positive allosteric modulator. Two modulators with opposite functional roles bind to overlapping sites within the transmembrane domain through common interactions, acting to stabilize distinct rotamer conformations of key residues on the TM6 helix.

Some cluster around 'hot spots' involved in translation regulation and some may participate in biogenesis. Whether ES play the same roles in different organisms is currently unclear, especially since their size may vary dramatically from one species to another and very little is known about their functions. Most likely, ES variation is linked to adaptation to a particular environment. In this chapter, we compare the interaction networks of ES from four kinetoplastid parasites, which have evolved in diverse insect vectors and mammalian hosts: Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major. Here, we comparatively analyze ribosome structures from these representative kinetoplastids and ascertain meaningful structural differences from mammalian ribosomes. We base our analysis on sequence alignments and three-dimensional structures of 80S ribosomes solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Striking differences in size are observed between ribosomes of different parasites, indicating that not all ES are expanded equally. Larger ES are not always matched by large surrounding ES or proteins extensions in their vicinity, a particularity that may lead to clues about their biological function. ES display different species-specific patterns of conservation, which underscore the density of their interaction network at the surface of the ribosome. Making sense of the conservation patterns of ES is part of a global effort to lay the basis for functional studies aimed at discovering unique kinetoplastid-specific sites suitable for therapeutic applications against these human and often animal pathogens.", "Keywords": ["Eukaryotic translation", "Expansion segment", "Kinetoplastid parasite", "Ribosomal RNA", "Ribosome structure"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Eukaryotic Cells", "Humans", "Kinetoplastida", "RNA, Ribosomal", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Quentin", "Last Name": "Vicens", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, CNRS, Architecture et R\u00e9activit\u00e9 de L'ARN, UPR 9002, 15 rue Ren\u00e9 Descartes, 67000, Strasbourg, France."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Bochler", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, CNRS, Architecture et R\u00e9activit\u00e9 de L'ARN, UPR 9002, 15 rue Ren\u00e9 Descartes, 67000, Strasbourg, France."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Jobe", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joachim", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jf2192@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Yaser", "Last Name": "Hashem", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, CNRS, Architecture et R\u00e9activit\u00e9 de L'ARN, UPR 9002, 15 rue Ren\u00e9 Descartes, 67000, Strasbourg, France. yaser.hashem@inserm.fr."}], "Journal": "Sub-cellular biochemistry", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33188030", "Title": "Nanobubble-controlled nanofluidic transport.", "Abstract": "Nanofluidic platforms offering tunable material transport are applicable in biosensing, chemical detection, and filtration.

We present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a NusG:70S ribosome complex and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data revealing simultaneous binding of NusG to RNAP and the intact 70S ribosome, providing the first direct structural evidence for NusG-mediated coupling. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo reporter assays show that recruitment of NusG occurs late in transcription and strongly depends on translation. Thus, our data suggest that coupling occurs initially via direct RNAP:ribosome contacts and is then mediated by NusG.", "Keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biochemistry Methods", "Structural Biology", "Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Biomolecular Structures"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Washburn", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philipp K", "Last Name": "Zuber", "Affiliation": "Biochemistry IV - Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, 95447 Bayreuth, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaser", "Last Name": "Hashem", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bingxin", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Harvey", "Affiliation": "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francisco J", "Last Name": "Acosta Reyes", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Max E", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

member of the class C family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-mediates inhibitory neurotransmission and has been implicated in epilepsy, pain and addiction1. A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2-6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9-14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

cryo-EM data sets to map the continuum of states of a molecule into a low-dimensional space spanned by eigenvectors or \"conformational coordinates\". This is done separately for each projection direction (PD) on an angular grid. One important step in deriving a consolidated map of occupancies, from which the free energy landscape of the molecule can be derived, is to propagate the conformational coordinates from a given choice of \"anchor PD\" across the entire angular space. Even when one eigenvector dominates, its sign might invert from one PD to the next. The propagation of the second eigenvector is particularly challenging when eigenvalues of the second and third eigenvector are closely matched, leading to occasional inversions in their ranking as we move across the angular grid. In the absence of a computational approach, this propagation across the angular space has been done thus far \"by hand\" using visual clues, thus greatly limiting the general use of the technique.

A mutant of EF-G, H91A, renders the factor impaired in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis and thereby stabilizes it on the ribosome.

Here, we elucidate the mechanism of a newly characterized regulatory translation factor, energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA), which is an Escherichia coli representative of the ATP-binding cassette F (ABC-F) protein family. Using cryo-EM, we demonstrate that the ATP-bound form of EttA binds to the ribosomal tRNA-exit site, where it forms bridging interactions between the ribosomal L1 stalk and the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that the ATP-bound form of EttA restricts ribosome and tRNA dynamics required for protein synthesis.

Initiation on HCV-like IRESs relies on their specific interaction with the 40S subunit, which places the initiation codon into the P site, where it directly base-pairs with eIF2-bound initiator methionyl transfer RNA to form a 48S initiation complex. However, all HCV-like IRESs also specifically interact with eIF3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), but the role of this interaction in IRES-mediated initiation has remained unknown. During canonical initiation, eIF3 binds to the 40S subunit as a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, and comparison of the ribosomal positions of eIF3 and the HCV IRES revealed that they overlap, so that their rearrangement would be required for formation of ribosomal complexes containing both components. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a 40S ribosomal complex containing eIF3 and the CSFV IRES. Remarkably, although the position and interactions of the CSFV IRES with the 40S subunit in this complex are similar to those of the HCV IRES in the 40S-IRES binary complex, eIF3 is completely displaced from its ribosomal position in the 43S complex, and instead interacts through its ribosome-binding surface exclusively with the apical region of domain III of the IRES. Our results suggest a role for the specific interaction of HCV-like IRESs with eIF3 in preventing ribosomal association of eIF3, which could serve two purposes: relieving the competition between the IRES and eIF3 for a common binding site on the 40S subunit, and reducing formation of 43S complexes, thereby favouring translation of viral mRNAs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding, Competitive", "Classical Swine Fever Virus", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Biosynthesis", "RNA, Viral", "Rabbits", "Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid", "Ribosome Subunits, Small, Eukaryotic", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yaser", "Last Name": "Hashem", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York City, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York City, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amedee", "Last Name": "des Georges", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vidya", "Last Name": "Dhote", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Langlois", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hstau Y", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Grassucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatyana V", "Last Name": "Pestova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher U T", "Last Name": "Hellen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joachim", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Nov28"}, {"PMID": "23755360", "Title": "Cryo-EM visualization of the ribosome in termination complex with apo-RF3 and RF1.", "Abstract": "Termination of messenger RNA translation in Bacteria and Archaea is initiated by release factors (RFs) 1 or 2 recognizing a stop codon in the ribosomal A site and releasing the peptide from the P-site transfer RNA.

The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart, owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments. The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces, and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process.
