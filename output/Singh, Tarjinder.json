[{"PMID": "38556557", "Title": "Genetic contribution to disease-course severity and progression in the SUPER-Finland study, a cohort of 10,403 individuals with psychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "Genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility of psychotic disorders, but less is known how they affect psychotic disease-course development. Utilizing polygenic scores (PGSs) in combination with longitudinal healthcare data with decades of follow-up we investigated the contributing genetics to psychotic disease-course severity and diagnostic shifts in the SUPER-Finland study, encompassing 10 403 genotyped individuals with a psychotic disorder. To longitudinally track the study participants' past disease-course severity, we created a psychiatric hospitalization burden metric using the full-coverage and nation-wide Finnish in-hospital registry (data from 1969 and onwards). Using a hierarchical model, ranking the psychotic diagnoses according to clinical severity, we show that high schizophrenia PGS (SZ-PGS) was associated with progression from lower ranked psychotic disorders to schizophrenia (OR\u2009=\u20091.32 [1.23-1.43], p\u2009=\u20091.26e-12). This development manifested already at psychotic illness onset as a higher psychiatric hospitalization burden, the proxy for disease-course severity. In schizophrenia (n\u2009=\u20095 479), both a high SZ-PGS and a low educational attainment PGS (EA-PGS) were associated with increased psychiatric hospitalization burden (p\u2009=\u20091.00e-04 and p\u2009=\u20094.53e-10). The SZ-PGS and the EA-PGS associated with distinct patterns of hospital usage. In individuals with high SZ-PGS, the increased hospitalization burden was composed of longer individual hospital stays, while low EA-PGS associated with shorter but more frequent hospital visits. The negative effect of a low EA-PGS was found to be partly mediated via substance use disorder, a major risk factor for hospitalizations. In conclusion, we show that high SZ-PGS and low EA-PGS both impacted psychotic disease-course development negatively but resulted in different disease-course trajectories.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anders", "Last Name": "K\u00e4mpe", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. anders.kampe@helsinki.fi."}, {"First Name": "Jaana", "Last Name": "Suvisaari", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Health and Welfare, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Markku", "Last Name": "L\u00e4hteenvuo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tarjinder", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ari", "Last Name": "Ahola-Olli", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Lea", "Last Name": "Urpa", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Willehard", "Last Name": "Haaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Jarmo", "Last Name": "Hietala", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Erkki", "Last Name": "Isomets\u00e4", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tuomas", "Last Name": "Jukuri", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Olli", "Last Name": "Kampman", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tuula", "Last Name": "Kiesepp\u00e4", "Affiliation": "Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Kaisla", "Last Name": "Lahdensuo", "Affiliation": "University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Jouko", "Last Name": "L\u00f6nnqvist", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Teemu", "Last Name": "M\u00e4nnynsalo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tiina", "Last Name": "Paunio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Jussi", "Last Name": "Niemi-Pyntt\u00e4ri", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Kimmo", "Last Name": "Suokas", "Affiliation": "Tampere University, Tampere, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Annamari", "Last Name": "Tuulio-Henriksson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Juha", "Last Name": "Veijola", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Asko", "Last Name": "Wegelius", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "SUPERFinland-Researchers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Daly", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine, Boston, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth S", "Last Name": "Kendler", "Affiliation": "Virginia Institute of Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Richmond, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aarno", "Last Name": "Palotie", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Olli", "Last Name": "Pietil\u00e4inen", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Cambridge, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "38467730", "Title": "Evidence for the additivity of rare and common variant burden throughout the spectrum of intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a common disorder, yet there is a wide spectrum of impairment from mild to profoundly affected individuals. Mild ID is seen as the low extreme of the general distribution of intelligence, while severe ID is often seen as a monogenic disorder caused by rare, pathogenic, highly penetrant variants. To investigate the genetic factors influencing mild and severe ID, we evaluated rare and common variation in the Northern Finland Intellectual Disability cohort (n\u2009=\u20091096 ID patients), a cohort with a high percentage of mild ID (n\u2009=\u2009550) and from a population bottleneck enriched in rare, damaging variation. Despite this enrichment, we found only a small percentage of ID was due to recessive Finnish-enriched variants (0.5%). A larger proportion was linked to dominant variation, with a significant burden of rare, damaging variation in both mild and severe ID. This rare variant burden was enriched in more severe ID (p\u2009=\u20092.4e-4), patients without a relative with ID (p\u2009=\u20094.76e-4), and in those with features associated with monogenic disorders. We also found a significant burden of common variants associated with decreased cognitive function, with no difference between mild and more severe ID. When we included common and rare variants in a joint model, the rare and common variants had additive effects in both mild and severe ID.

In schizophrenia, aberrant belief dynamics may lead to psychosis, but the mechanisms underlying this process are unknown, in part, due to lack of appropriate animal models and behavior readouts. Here, we address this challenge by taking two synergistic approaches. First, we generate a mouse model bearing patient-derived point mutation in Grin2a (Grin2aY700X+/-), a gene that confers high-risk for schizophrenia and recently identified by large-scale exome sequencing. Second, we develop a computationally trackable foraging task, in which mice form and update belief-driven strategies in a dynamic environment. We found that Grin2aY700X+/- mice perform less optimally than their wild-type (WT) littermates, showing unstable behavioral states and a slower belief update rate. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we identified the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus as hypofunctional in Grin2aY700X+/- mice, and in vivo task recordings showed that MD neurons encoded dynamic values and behavioral states in WT mice. Optogenetic inhibition of MD neurons in WT mice phenocopied Grin2aY700X+/- mice, and enhancing MD activity rescued task deficits in Grin2aY700X+/- mice.

For some diseases, such as knee osteoarthritis where the routine course of diagnosis involves an X-ray, image-based phenotyping offers an alternate and unbiased way to ascertain disease cases. We investigated this by training a deep-learning model to ascertain knee osteoarthritis cases from knee DXA scans that achieved clinician-level performance. Using our model, we identified 1931 (178%) more cases than currently diagnosed in the health record. Individuals diagnosed as cases by our model had higher rates of self-reported knee pain, for longer durations and with increased severity compared to control individuals. We trained another deep-learning model to measure the knee joint space width, a quantitative phenotype linked to knee osteoarthritis severity. In performing genetic association analysis, we found that use of a quantitative measure improved the number of genome-wide significant loci we discovered by an order of magnitude compared with our binary model of cases and controls despite the two phenotypes being highly genetically correlated. In addition we discovered associations between our quantitative measure of knee osteoarthritis and increased risk of adult fractures- a leading cause of injury-related death in older individuals-, illustrating the capability of image-based phenotyping to reveal epidemiological associations not captured in the electronic health record.

By integrative multi-omics analysis, here we show that astrocytic and microglial proteins are increased in TauP301S synapse fractions with age and in a C1q-dependent manner. In addition to microglia, we identified that astrocytes contribute substantially to synapse elimination in TauP301S hippocampi. Notably, we found relatively more excitatory synapse marker proteins in astrocytic lysosomes, whereas microglial lysosomes contained more inhibitory synapse material. C1q deletion reduced astrocyte-synapse association and decreased astrocytic and microglial synapses engulfment in TauP301S mice and rescued synapse density. Finally, in an AD mouse model that combines \u03b2-amyloid and Tau pathologies, deletion of the AD risk gene Trem2 impaired microglial phagocytosis of synapses, whereas astrocytes engulfed more inhibitory synapses around plaques. Together, our data reveal that astrocytes contact and eliminate synapses in a C1q-dependent manner and thereby contribute to pathological synapse loss and that astrocytic phagocytosis can compensate for microglial dysfunction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Alzheimer Disease", "Complement C1q", "Microglia", "Astrocytes", "Synapses", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Receptors, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Borislav", "Last Name": "Dejanovic", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA. bdejanov@broadinstitute.org."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ming-Chi", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Graykowski", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vineela D", "Last Name": "Gandham", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Imaging, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Rose", "Affiliation": "Department of Microchemistry Proteomics and Lipidomics, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Corey E", "Last Name": "Bakalarski", "Affiliation": "Department of Microchemistry Proteomics and Lipidomics, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hai", "Last Name": "Ngu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shristi", "Last Name": "Pandey", "Affiliation": "Department of OMNI Bioinformatics, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell G", "Last Name": "Rezzonico", "Affiliation": "Department of OMNI Bioinformatics, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brad A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Department of OMNI Bioinformatics, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rose", "Last Name": "Edmonds", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomarker Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ann", "Last Name": "De Mazi\u00e8re", "Affiliation": "Section Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Rakosi-Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tarjinder", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Klumperman", "Affiliation": "Section Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Oded", "Last Name": "Foreman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomarker Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luke", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Imaging, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesse E", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA. hanson.jesse@gene.com."}], "Journal": "Nature aging", "PubDate": "2022Sep"}, {"PMID": "36914870", "Title": "Schizophrenia risk conferred by rare protein-truncating variants is conserved across diverse human populations.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic mental illness and among the most debilitating conditions encountered in medical practice. A recent landmark SCZ study of the protein-coding regions of the genome identified a causal role for ten genes and a concentration of rare variant signals in evolutionarily constrained genes1. This recent study-and most other large-scale human genetics studies-was mainly composed of individuals of European (EUR) ancestry, and the generalizability of the findings in non-EUR populations remains unclear. To address this gap, we designed a custom sequencing panel of 161 genes selected based on the current knowledge of SCZ genetics and sequenced a new cohort of 11,580 SCZ cases and 10,555 controls of diverse ancestries. Replicating earlier work, we found that cases carried a significantly higher burden of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) among evolutionarily constrained genes (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.48; P\u2009=\u20095.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6). In meta-analyses with existing datasets totaling up to 35,828 cases and 107,877 controls, this excess burden was largely consistent across five ancestral populations. Two genes (SRRM2 and AKAP11) were newly implicated as SCZ risk genes, and one gene (PCLO) was identified as shared by individuals with SCZ and those with autism. Overall, our results lend robust support to the rare allelic spectrum of the genetic architecture of SCZ being conserved across diverse human populations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Schizophrenia", "Autistic Disorder", "Alleles", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dongjing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. dol31@pitt.edu."}, {"First Name": "Dara", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Fennessy", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Esther", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica S", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Pamela Sklar Division of Psychiatric Genomics, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "You Jeong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marysia-Kolbe", "Last Name": "Rieder", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Ascolillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Agathe", "Last Name": "de Pins", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Dobbyn", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dannielle", "Last Name": "Lebovitch", "Affiliation": "Pamela Sklar Division of Psychiatric Genomics, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Moya", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tan-Hoang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lillian", "Last Name": "Wilkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arsalan", "Last Name": "Hassan", "Affiliation": "University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Phase 3 Targeted Sequencing of Schizophrenia Study Team", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Burdick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Buxbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Enrico", "Last Name": "Domenici", "Affiliation": "Centre for Computational and Systems Biology, Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Rovereto, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sophia", "Last Name": "Frangou", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette M", "Last Name": "Hartmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Claudine", "Last Name": "Laurent-Levinson", "Affiliation": "Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Groupe de Recherche Clinique n\u00b015-Troubles Psychiatriques et D\u00e9veloppement, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Dheeraj", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Rare Diseases, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, F.

"The human skeletal form underlies our ability to walk on two legs, but unlike standing height, the genetic basis of limb lengths and skeletal proportions is less well understood. Here we applied a deep learning model to 31,221 whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images from the UK Biobank (UKB) to extract 23 different image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that include all long bone lengths as well as hip and shoulder width, which we analyzed while controlling for height. All skeletal proportions are highly heritable (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc40-50%), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits identified 179 independent loci, of which 102 loci were not associated with height. These loci are enriched in genes regulating skeletal development as well as associated with rare human skeletal diseases and abnormal mouse skeletal phenotypes. Genetic correlation and genomic structural equation modeling indicated that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were genetically independent of width and torso proportions. Phenotypic and polygenic risk score analyses identified specific associations between osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, and skeletal proportions of the corresponding regions. We also found genomic evidence of evolutionary change in arm-to-leg and hip-width proportions in humans consistent with striking anatomical changes in these skeletal proportions in the hominin fossil record. In contrast to cardiovascular, auto-immune, metabolic, and other categories of traits, loci associated with these skeletal proportions are significantly enriched in human accelerated regions (HARs), and regulatory elements of genes differentially expressed through development between humans and the great apes.

"Abstract": "We report results from the Bipolar Exome (BipEx) collaboration analysis of whole-exome sequencing of 13,933 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) matched with 14,422 controls. We find an excess of ultra-rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in patients with BD among genes under strong evolutionary constraint in both major BD subtypes. We find enrichment of ultra-rare PTVs within genes implicated from a recent schizophrenia exome meta-analysis (SCHEMA; 24,248 cases and 97,322 controls) and among binding targets of CHD8. Genes implicated from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of BD, however, are not significantly enriched for ultra-rare PTVs. Combining gene-level results with SCHEMA, AKAP11 emerges as a definitive risk gene (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20097.06, P\u2009=\u20092.83\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9). At the protein level, AKAP-11 interacts with GSK3B, the hypothesized target of lithium, a primary treatment for BD. Our results lend support to BD's polygenicity, demonstrating a role for rare coding variation as a significant risk factor in BD etiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["A Kinase Anchor Proteins",

substantial risk for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Rare coding variation has historically provided the most direct connections between gene function and disease pathogenesis. By meta-analysing the whole exomes of 24,248 schizophrenia cases and 97,322 controls, we implicate ultra-rare coding variants (URVs) in 10 genes as conferring substantial risk for schizophrenia (odds ratios of 3-50, P\u2009<\u20092.14\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) and 32 genes at a false discovery rate of <5%. These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure and function of the synapse. The associations of the\u00a0NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We observe an overlap of rare variant risk among schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders1, epilepsy and severe neurodevelopmental disorders2, although different mutation types are implicated in some shared genes. Most genes described here, however, are not implicated in neurodevelopment. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk3, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors converge at least partially on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, which indicates that more risk genes await discovery using this approach.",

Here, we characterize six different CaMKII\u03b1 variants found in patients with schizophrenia. Only R396stop disrupted the 12-meric holoenzyme structure, GluN2B binding, and synaptic localization. Additionally, R396stop impaired T286 autophosphorylation that generates Ca2+-independent \"autonomous\" kinase activity. This impairment in T286 autophosphorylation was shared by the R8H mutation, the only mutation that additionally reduced stimulated kinase activity. None of the mutations affected the levels of CaMKII expression in HEK293 cells. Thus, impaired CaMKII function was detected only for R396stop and R8H. However, two of the other mutations have been later identified also in the general population, and not all mutations found in patients with schizophrenia would be expected to cause disease.

heart defects (CHDs) have a neonatal incidence of 0.8-1% (refs. 1,2). Despite abundant examples of monogenic CHD in humans and mice, CHD has a low absolute sibling recurrence risk (\u223c2.7%), suggesting a considerable role for de novo mutations (DNMs) and/or incomplete penetrance. De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) have been shown to be enriched among the 10% of 'syndromic' patients with extra-cardiac manifestations. We exome sequenced 1,891 probands, including both syndromic CHD (S-CHD, n = 610) and nonsyndromic CHD (NS-CHD, n = 1,281). In S-CHD, we confirmed a significant enrichment of de novo PTVs but not inherited PTVs in known CHD-associated genes, consistent with recent findings. Conversely, in NS-CHD we observed significant enrichment of PTVs inherited from unaffected parents in CHD-associated genes. We identified three genome-wide significant S-CHD disorders caused by DNMs in CHD4, CDK13 and PRKD1. Our study finds evidence for distinct genetic architectures underlying the low sibling recurrence risk in S-CHD and NS-CHD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autoantigens", "CDC2 Protein Kinase",

of 4,264 schizophrenia cases, 9,343 controls and 1,077 trios, we identified a genome-wide significant association between rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SETD1A and risk for schizophrenia (P = 3.3 \u00d7 10(-9)). We found only two heterozygous LoF variants in 45,376 exomes from individuals without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis, indicating that SETD1A is substantially depleted of LoF variants in the general population. Seven of the ten individuals with schizophrenia carrying SETD1A LoF variants also had learning difficulties. We further identified four SETD1A LoF carriers among 4,281 children with severe developmental disorders and two more carriers in an independent sample of 5,720 Finnish exomes, both with notable neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Together, our observations indicate that LoF variants in SETD1A cause a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. Combining these data with previous common variant evidence, we suggest that epigenetic dysregulation, specifically in the histone H3K4 methylation pathway, is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Finland", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease",

In this study, we traced the fate of adult \u03b2 cells after Pdx1 deletion. As expected, \u03b2-cell-specific removal of Pdx1 resulted in severe hyperglycemia within days. Surprisingly, a large fraction of Pdx1-deleted cells rapidly acquired ultrastructural and physiological features of \u03b1 cells, indicating that a robust cellular reprogramming had occurred. Reprogrammed cells exhibited a global transcriptional shift that included derepression of the \u03b1 cell transcription factor MafB, resulting in a transcriptional profile that closely resembled that of \u03b1 cells. These findings indicate that Pdx1 acts as a\u00a0master regulator of \u03b2 cell fate by simultaneously activating genes essential for \u03b2 cell identity and repressing those associated with \u03b1 cell identity.
