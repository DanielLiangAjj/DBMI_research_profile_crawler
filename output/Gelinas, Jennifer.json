However, electrode/tissue interlayer materials such as ionically conducting pastes can negatively affect recordings by introducing lateral electrode-to-electrode ionic crosstalk and reducing spatial resolution. To overcome this issue, biocompatible, anisotropic-conducting interlayer composites (ACI) that establish an electrically anisotropic interface with the skin are developed, enabling the application of dense cutaneous sensor arrays. High-density, conformable electrodes are also microfabricated that adhere to the ACI and follow the curvilinear surface of the skin. The results show that ACI significantly enhances the spatial resolution of epidermal electromyography (EMG) recording compared to conductive paste, permitting the acquisition of single muscle action potentials with distinct spatial profiles. The high-density EMG in developing mice, non-human primates, and humans is validated.

Using light as a probe for selective neuronal activation or inhibition and as a means to read out neural activity has dramatically enhanced our understanding of complex neural circuits. However, a common limitation of optogenetic studies to date is their invasiveness and spatiotemporal range. Direct viral injections into the brain tissue along with implantation of optical fibers and recording electrodes can disrupt the neuronal circuitry and cause significant damage. Conventional approaches are spatially limited around the site of the direct injection and insufficient in examining large networks throughout the brain. Lastly, optogenetics is currently not easily scalable to large animals or humans. Here, we demonstrate that optogenetic excitation can be achieved entirely non-invasively through the intact skull in mice. Using a needle-free combination of focused ultrasound-mediated viral delivery and extracorporeal illumination with red light, we achieved selective neuronal activation at depths up to 4\u00a0mm in the murine brain, confirmed through cFos expression and electrophysiology measurements within the treated areas. Ultrasound treatment significantly reduced freezing time during recall in fear conditioning experiments, but remote light exposure had a moderate effect on the freezing behavior of mice treated with viral vectors. The proposed method has the potential to open new avenues of studying, but also stimulating, neuronal networks, in an effort to elucidate normal or dysfunctional brain activity and treat neurological diseases.
