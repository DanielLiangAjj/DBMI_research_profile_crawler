[{"PMID": "38895264", "Title": "Lestaurtinib's antineoplastic activity converges on JAK/STAT signaling to inhibit advanced forms of therapy resistant ovarian cancer.", "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological malignancy, owing to its late-stage diagnosis and high rates of recurrence and resistance following standard-of-care treatment, highlighting the need for novel treatment approaches. Through an unbiased drug screen, we identified the kinase inhibitor, lestaurtinib, as a potent antineoplastic agent for chemotherapy- and PARP-inhibitor (PARPi)-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells and patient derived xenografts (PDXs). RNA-sequencing revealed that lestaurtinib potently suppressed JAK/STAT signaling and lestaurtinib efficacy was shown to be directly related to JAK/STAT pathway activity in cell lines and PDX models. Most ovarian cancer cells exhibited constitutive JAK/STAT pathway activation and genetic loss of STAT1 and STAT3 resulted in growth inhibition. Lestaurtinib also displayed synergy when combined with cisplatin and olaparib, including in a model of PARPi resistance. In contrast, the most well-known JAK/STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib, lacked antineoplastic activity against all ovarian cancer cell lines and PDX models tested. This divergent behavior was reflected in the ability of lestaurtinib to block both Y701/705 and S727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, whereas ruxolitinib failed to block S727. Consistent with these findings, lestaurtinib additionally inhibited JNK and ERK activity, leading to more complete suppression of STAT phosphorylation. Concordantly, combinatorial treatment with ruxolitinib and a JNK or ERK inhibitor resulted in synergistic antineoplastic effects at dose levels where single agents were ineffective. Taken together, these findings indicate that lestaurtinib, and other treatments that converge on JAK/STAT signaling, are worthy of further pre-clinical and clinical exploration for the treatment of highly aggressive and advanced forms of ovarian cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Esther P B", "Last Name": "Rodman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Emch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaonan", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Archit", "Last Name": "Bajaj", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Pearson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "August J", "Last Name": "John", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yamillie", "Last Name": "Ortiz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam D", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saloni", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gustavo", "Last Name": "Baldassarre", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott H", "Last Name": "Kaufmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S John", "Last Name": "Weroha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Hawse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun09"}, {"PMID": "38621923", "Title": "Recurrent RhoGAP gene fusion CLDN18-ARHGAP26 promotes RHOA activation and focal adhesion kinase and YAP-TEAD signalling in diffuse gastric cancer.", "Abstract": "Genomic studies of gastric cancer have identified highly recurrent genomic alterations impacting RHO signalling, especially in the diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) histological subtype.

Tyr42-to-Cys (Y42C) and Leu57-to-Val (L57V) substitutions are the two most prevalent RHOA mutations in diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). RHOAY42C exhibits a gain-of-function phenotype and is an oncogenic driver in DGC. Here, we determined how RHOAL57V promotes DGC growth. In mouse gastric organoids with deletion of Cdh1, which encodes the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, the expression of RHOAL57V, but not of wild-type RHOA, induced an abnormal morphology similar to that of patient-derived DGC organoids. RHOAL57V also exhibited a gain-of-function phenotype and promoted F-actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. RHOAL57V retained interaction with effectors but exhibited impaired RHOA-intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, which favored formation of the active GTP-bound state. Introduction of missense mutations at KRAS residues analogous to Tyr42 and Leu57 in RHOA did not activate KRAS oncogenic potential, indicating distinct functional effects in otherwise highly related GTPases. Both RHOA mutants stimulated the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 through actin dynamics to promote DGC progression; however, RHOAL57V additionally did so by activating the kinases IGF1R and PAK1, distinct from the FAK-mediated mechanism induced by RHOAY42C.

Experimental evidence suggests that this synthetic lethal phenotype is driven by numerous TA dinucleotide repeats that undergo expansion mutations in the setting of long-standing MMR deficiency.

Here we perform haplotype-specific analysis of chromosomal copy-number evolution in the progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) on multiregional whole-genome sequencing data of BE with dysplasia and microscopic EAC foci. We identify distinct patterns of copy-number evolution indicating multigenerational chromosomal instability that is initiated by cell division errors but propagated only after p53 loss. While abnormal mitosis, including whole-genome duplication, underlies chromosomal copy-number changes, segmental alterations display signatures of successive breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromothripsis of unstable dicentric chromosomes. Our analysis elucidates how multigenerational chromosomal instability generates copy-number variation in BE cells, precipitates complex alterations including DNA amplifications, and promotes their independent clonal expansion and transformation. In particular, we suggest sloping copy-number variation as a signature of ongoing chromosomal instability that precedes copy-number complexity. These findings suggest copy-number heterogeneity in advanced cancers originates from chromosomal instability in precancerous cells and such instability may be identified from the presence of sloping copy-number variation in bulk sequencing data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Barrett Esophagus", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Adenocarcinoma", "Chromosomal Instability", "Precancerous Conditions", "Genomics", "Disease Progression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunyang", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard W", "Last Name": "Tourdot", "Affiliation": "Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory J", "Last Name": "Brunette", "Affiliation": "Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chip", "Last Name": "Stewart", "Affiliation": "Cancer Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 415 Main St, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lili", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hideo", "Last Name": "Baba", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 2 Chome-40-1 Kurokami, Chuo Ward, Kumamoto, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masayuki", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation of Cancer Research, 3-8-31 Ariake, Koto, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Agoston T", "Last Name": "Agoston", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kunal", "Last Name": "Jajoo", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jon M", "Last Name": "Davison", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katie S", "Last Name": "Nason", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Baystate Medical Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 759 Chestnut St, Springfield, MA, 01107, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gad", "Last Name": "Getz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth K", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Imamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation of Cancer Research, 3-8-31 Ariake, Koto, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Odze", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. adam.bass@novartis.com."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Stachler", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.

tract. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk for bowel cancers, and it has been posited that a field of genetic changes may underlie this risk. Here, we define the clinical features, genomic landscape, and germline alterations in 174 patients with colitis-associated cancers and sequenced 29 synchronous or isolated dysplasia. TP53 alterations, an early and highly recurrent event in colitis-associated cancers, occur in half of dysplasia, largely as convergent evolution of independent events. Wnt pathway alterations are infrequent, and our data suggest transcriptional rewiring away from Wnt. Sequencing of multiple dysplasia/cancer lesions from mouse models and patients demonstrates rare shared alterations between lesions. These findings suggest neoplastic bowel lesions developing in a background of inflammation experience lineage plasticity away from Wnt activation early during tumorigenesis and largely occur as genetically independent events.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Colitis-Associated Neoplasms", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Genomics", "Hyperplasia", "Inflammation", "Evolution, Molecular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Walid K", "Last Name": "Chatila", "Affiliation": "Tri-Institutional Program in Computational Biology and Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Walch", "Affiliation": "Marie-Jos\u00e9e and Henry R.

Abnormal cytoplasmic enrichment observed in solid tumors often correlates with poor clinical outcome. The mechanism of cytoplasmic redistribution and ensuing functional role of cytoplasmic hnRNPK remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the SCFFbxo4 E3 ubiquitin ligase restricts the pro-oncogenic activity of hnRNPK via K63 linked polyubiquitylation, thus limiting its ability to bind target mRNA. We identify SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK responsive mRNAs whose products regulate cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and invasion. Loss of SCFFbxo4 leads to enhanced cell invasion, migration, and tumor metastasis. C-Myc was identified as one target of SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK. Fbxo4 loss triggers hnRNPK-dependent increase in c-Myc translation, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Increased c-Myc positions SCFFbxo4-hnRNPK dysregulated cancers for potential therapeutic interventions that target c-Myc-dependence.

Intestinal transcription factors (TFs) are expressed in both conditions, with unclear causal roles and cis-regulatory mechanisms. Ectopic CDX2 reprogrammed isogenic mouse stomach organoid lines to a hybrid stomach-intestinal state transcriptionally similar to clinical metaplasia; squamous esophageal organoids resisted this CDX2-mediated effect. Reprogramming was associated with induced activity at thousands of previously inaccessible intestine-restricted enhancers, where CDX2 occupied DNA directly. HNF4A, a TF recently implicated in BE pathogenesis, induced weaker intestinalization by binding a novel shadow Cdx2 enhancer and hence activating Cdx2 expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated germline deletion of that cis-element demonstrated its requirement in Cdx2 induction and in the resulting activation of intestinal genes in stomach cells. dCas9-conjugated KRAB repression mapped this activity to the shadow enhancer's HNF4A binding site. Altogether, we show extensive but selective recruitment of intestinal enhancers by CDX2 in gastric cells and that HNF4A-mediated ectopic CDX2 expression in the stomach occurs through a conserved shadow cis-element.

Repression of e1 in SOX2-high cells causes collapse of the surrounding enhancers, remarkable reduction in SOX2 expression, and a global transcriptional change reminiscent of SOX2 knockout. The e1 enhancer is driven by a combination of transcription factors including SOX2 itself and the AP-1 complex, which facilitates recruitment of the co-activator BRD4. CRISPR-mediated activation of e1 in SOX2-low cells is sufficient to rebuild the e1-SOX2 loop and activate SOX2 expression.

Intriguingly, suppression of CK1\u03b5 not only efficiently prevents RB1 from degradation, but also prevents CDK4/6i-induced CDK6 upregulation by modulating SP1 protein stability, thereby enhancing CDK4/6i efficacy and overcoming resistance to CDK4/6i in vitro. Using xenograft and PDX models, we further demonstrate that combined inhibition of CK1\u03b5 and CDK4/6 results in marked suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Altogether, these results uncover the molecular mechanisms by which CDK4/6i treatment alters RB1 and CDK6 protein abundance, thereby driving the acquisition of CDK4/6i resistance.

The purpose of our study was to perform a detailed clinicopathologic analysis of these histologic types of treatment responses and correlate these findings with patient outcome. Clinical and pathologic parameters from 110 esophagogastrectomies were recorded and analyzed. Two main types of histologic responses were observed: inflammatory-predominant response (59%) and florid foreign body-type giant cell response to keratin (41%). Irrespective of cG, cTNM, and amount of residual cancer, florid foreign body-type giant cell reaction was predominantly noted deep within the esophageal wall, while the inflammatory response was restricted to the mucosa, submucosa, and inner half of muscularis propria. Patients with foreign body-type giant cell response showed significantly better overall survival compared with the inflammatory response group (log-rank test P=0.015). Florid foreign body-type giant cell response was the only factor associated with improved survival in a multivariable analysis for overall survival (hazard ratio=0.5; 95% confidence interval=0.3-1.0; P=0.038), but not in the model for disease-specific survival, whereas ypTNM stage II was the only significant risk factor for disease-specific survival in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio=3.4; 95% confidence interval=1.0-11.2; P=0.047).

P53R175H (homologous to Trp53R172H in mice) is a common hot spot mutation. How metastasis is regulated by p53R175H in ESCC remains to be investigated. To investigate p53R175H-mediated molecular mechanisms, we used a carcinogen-induced approach in Trp53R172H/- mice to model ESCC. In the primary Trp53R172H/- tumor cell lines, we depleted Trp53R172H (shTrp53) and observed a marked reduction in cell invasion in vitro and lung metastasis burden in a tail-vein injection model in comparing isogenic cells (shCtrl). Furthermore, we performed bulk RNA-seq to compare gene expression profiles of metastatic and primary shCtrl and shTrp53 cells. We identified the YAP-BIRC5 axis as a potential mediator of Trp53R172H -mediated metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of Survivin, an antiapoptotic protein encoded by BIRC5, increases in the presence of Trp53R172H Furthermore, depletion of Survivin specifically decreases Trp53R172H-driven lung metastasis. Mechanistically, Trp53R172H but not wild-type Trp53, binds with YAP in ESCC cells, suggesting their cooperation to induce Survivin expression. Furthermore, Survivin high expression level is associated with increased metastasis in several GI cancers.

However, it is unclear whether aneuploidy generates any clinically relevant vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Here we mapped the aneuploidy landscapes of about 1,000 human cancer cell lines, and analysed genetic and chemical perturbation screens2-9 to identify cellular vulnerabilities associated with aneuploidy. We found that aneuploid cancer cells show increased sensitivity to genetic perturbation of core components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis10. Unexpectedly, we also found that aneuploid cancer cells were less sensitive than diploid cells to short-term exposure to multiple SAC inhibitors. Indeed, aneuploid cancer cells became increasingly sensitive to inhibition of SAC over time. Aneuploid cells exhibited aberrant spindle geometry and dynamics, and kept dividing when the SAC was inhibited, resulting in the accumulation of mitotic defects, and in unstable and less-fit karyotypes. Therefore, although aneuploid cancer cells could overcome inhibition of SAC more readily than diploid cells, their long-term proliferation was jeopardized. We identified a specific mitotic kinesin, KIF18A, whose activity was perturbed in aneuploid cancer cells. Aneuploid cancer cells were particularly vulnerable to depletion of KIF18A, and KIF18A overexpression restored their response to SAC inhibition.

Loss of Rab11-FIP1 increases tumor cell invasion in part through mutant p53 but also in an independent manner.

Among the most provocative recent results in DGC has been that of highly recurrent missense mutations in the GTPase RHOA. The function of these mutations has remained unresolved. We demonstrate that RHOAY42C, the most common RHOA mutation in DGC, is a gain-of-function oncogenic mutant, and that expression of RHOAY42C with inactivation of the canonical tumor suppressor Cdh1 induces metastatic DGC in a mouse model. Biochemically, RHOAY42C exhibits impaired GTP hydrolysis and enhances interaction with its effector ROCK. RHOA Y42C mutation and Cdh1 loss induce actin/cytoskeletal rearrangements and activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which activates YAP-TAZ, PI3K-AKT, and \u03b2-catenin. RHOAY42C murine models were sensitive to FAK inhibition and to combined YAP and PI3K pathway blockade. These results, coupled with sensitivity to FAK inhibition in patient-derived DGC cell lines, nominate FAK as a novel target for these cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: The functional significance of recurrent RHOA mutations in DGC has remained unresolved. Through biochemical studies and mouse modeling of the hotspot RHOAY42C mutation, we establish that these mutations are activating, detail their effects upon cell signaling, and define how RHOA-mediated FAK activation imparts sensitivity to pharmacologic FAK inhibitors.See related commentary by Benton and Chernoff, p. 182.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p.

Targeted Therapies in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma.", "Abstract": "Gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEA) are devastating diseases with stark global presence. Over the past 10 years, there have been minimal improvements in treatment approach despite numerous clinical trials. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding the molecular features of these cancers and the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by their intrinsic genomic instability and heterogeneity. We highlight the potential of genomic heterogeneity to influence clinical trial outcomes for targeted therapies and emphasize the need for comprehensive molecular profiling to guide treatment selection and adapt treatment to resistance and genomic evolution. Revising our clinical approach to GEA by leveraging genomic advances will be integral to the success of current and future treatments, especially as novel targets become therapeutically tractable. SIGNIFICANCE: GEAs are deadly cancers with few treatment options. Characterization of the genomic landscape of these cancers has revealed considerable genetic diversity and spatial heterogeneity. Understanding these fundamental properties of GEA will be critical for overcoming barriers to the development of novel, more effective therapeutic strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Precision Medicine", "Stomach Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ankur K", "Last Name": "Nagaraja", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Osamu", "Last Name": "Kikuchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. adam_bass@dfci.harvard.edu."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31585941", "Title": "A Comprehensive PDX Gastric Cancer Collection Captures Cancer Cell-Intrinsic Transcriptional MSI Traits.", "Abstract": "Gastric cancer is the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality. In spite of significant therapeutic improvements, the clinical outcome for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor; thus, the identification and validation of novel targets is extremely important from a clinical point of view. We generated a wide, multilevel platform of gastric cancer models, comprising 100 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), primary cell lines, and organoids. Samples were classified according to their histology, microsatellite stability, Epstein-Barr virus status, and molecular profile. This PDX platform is the widest in an academic institution, and it includes all the gastric cancer histologic and molecular types identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas. PDX histopathologic features were consistent with those of patients' primary tumors and were maintained throughout passages in mice. Factors modulating grafting rate were histology, TNM stage, copy number gain of tyrosine kinases/KRAS genes, and microsatellite stability status. PDX and PDX-derived cells/organoids demonstrated potential usefulness to study targeted therapy response. Finally, PDX transcriptomic analysis identified a cancer cell-intrinsic microsatellite instability (MSI) signature, which was efficiently exported to gastric cancer, allowing the identification, among microsatellite stable (MSS) patients, of a subset of MSI-like tumors with common molecular aspects and significant better prognosis. In conclusion, we generated a wide gastric cancer PDX platform, whose exploitation will help identify and validate novel \"druggable\" targets and optimize therapeutic strategies. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of gastric cancer PDXs allowed the identification of a cancer cell-intrinsic MSI signature, recognizing a subset of MSS patients with MSI transcriptional traits, endowed with better prognosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports a multilevel platform of gastric cancer PDXs and identifies a MSI gastric signature that could contribute to the advancement of precision medicine in gastric cancer.",

{"PMID": "30087114", "Title": "BET Bromodomain Inhibition Cooperates with PD-1 Blockade to Facilitate Antitumor Response in Kras-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.", "Abstract": "KRAS mutation is present in approximately 30% of human lung adenocarcinomas. Although recent advances in targeted therapy have shown great promise, effective targeting of KRAS remains elusive, and concurrent alterations in tumor suppressors render KRAS-mutant tumors even more resistant to existing therapies. Contributing to the refractoriness of KRAS-mutant tumors are immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as increased presence of suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumors and elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells. Treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors is beneficial for hematologic malignancies, and they have Treg-disruptive effects in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model. Targeting PD-1-inhibitory signals through PD-1 antibody blockade also has substantial therapeutic impact in lung cancer, although these outcomes are limited to a minority of patients. We hypothesized that the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 would synergize with PD-1 blockade to promote a robust antitumor response in lung cancer. In the present study, using Kras+/LSL-G12D ; Trp53L/L (KP) mouse models of NSCLC, we identified cooperative effects between JQ1 and PD-1 antibody. The numbers of tumor-infiltrating Tregs were reduced and activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which had a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine profile, was enhanced, underlying their improved effector function. Furthermore, lung tumor-bearing mice treated with this combination showed robust and long-lasting antitumor responses compared with either agent alone, culminating in substantial improvement in the overall survival of treated mice. Thus, combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade offers a promising therapeutic approach for solid malignancies such as lung adenocarcinoma.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are an essential component of the TME, contributing to tumorigenesis by secreting growth factors, modifying the extracellular matrix, supporting angiogenesis, and suppressing antitumor immune responses. Through an unbiased approach, we have established that IL-6 mediates cross-talk between tumor cells and CAF not only by supporting tumor cell growth, but also by promoting fibroblast activation. As a result, IL-6 receptor (IL6R\u03b1) and downstream effectors offer opportunities for targeted therapy in upper-GI cancers. IL-6 loss suppressed tumorigenesis in physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) organotypic and 3D tumoroid models and murine models of esophageal cancer. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6R\u03b1 antibody, suppressed tumor growth in vivo in part via inhibition of STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling. Analysis of a pan-cancer TCGA dataset revealed an inverse correlation between IL-6 and IL6R\u03b1 overexpression and patient survival. Therefore, we expanded evaluation of tocilizumab to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient-derived xenografts and gastric adenocarcinoma xenografts, demonstrating suppression of tumor growth and altered STAT3 and ERK1/2 gene signatures. We used small-molecule inhibitors of STAT3 and MEK1/2 signaling to suppress tumorigenesis in the 3D organotypic model of esophageal cancer. We demonstrate that IL6 is a major contributor to the dynamic cross-talk between tumor cells and CAF in the TME. Our findings provide a translational rationale for inhibition of IL6R\u03b1 and downstream signaling pathways as a novel targeted therapy in oral-upper-GI cancers.Significance: These findings demonstrate the interaction of esophageal cancer and cancer-associated fibroblasts through IL-6 signaling, providing rationale for a novel therapeutic approach to target these cancers.

Here we explore a secondary means of KRAS activation in cancer: focal high-level amplification of the KRAS gene in the absence of coding mutations. These amplifications occur most commonly in esophageal, gastric and ovarian adenocarcinomas2-4. KRAS-amplified gastric cancer models show marked overexpression of the KRAS protein and are insensitive to MAPK blockade owing to their capacity to adaptively respond by rapidly increasing KRAS-GTP levels. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the guanine-exchange factors SOS1 and SOS2 or the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 can attenuate this adaptive process and that targeting these factors, both genetically and pharmacologically, can enhance the sensitivity of KRAS-amplified models to MEK inhibition in both in vitro and in vivo settings. These data demonstrate the relevance of copy-number amplification as a mechanism of KRAS activation, and uncover the therapeutic potential for targeting of these tumors through combined SHP2 and MEK

Lung Cancer and Underlies a Rationale for Upfront FGFR-MEK Blockade.", "Abstract": "The FGFR kinases are promising therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types, including lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and bladder cancer. Although several FGFR kinase inhibitors have entered clinical trials, single-agent clinical efficacy has been modest and resistance invariably occurs. We therefore conducted a genome-wide functional screen to characterize mechanisms of resistance to FGFR inhibition in a FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cellular model. Our screen identified known resistance drivers, such as MET, and additional novel resistance mediators including members of the neurotrophin receptor pathway (NTRK), the TAM family of tyrosine kinases (TYRO3, MERTK, AXL), and MAPK pathway, which were further validated in additional FGFR-dependent models. In an orthogonal approach, we generated a large panel of resistant clones by chronic exposure to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR1- and FGFR3-dependent cellular models and characterized gene expression profiles employing the L1000 platform. Notably, resistant clones had enrichment for NTRK and MAPK signaling pathways. Novel mediators of resistance to FGFR inhibition were found to compensate for FGFR loss in part through reactivation of MAPK pathway. Intriguingly, coinhibition of FGFR and specific receptor tyrosine kinases identified in our screen was not sufficient to suppress ERK activity or to prevent resistance to FGFR inhibition, suggesting a redundant reactivation of RAS-MAPK pathway. Dual blockade of FGFR and MEK, however, proved to be a more powerful approach in preventing resistance across diverse FGFR dependencies and may represent a therapeutic opportunity to achieve durable responses to FGFR inhibition in FGFR-dependent cancers.

More than 30% of PDXs generated from gastric carcinoma samples developed human B-cell lymphomas instead of gastric cancer. These lymphomas were monoclonal, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive, originated tumorigenic cell cultures and displayed a mutational burden and an expression profile distinct from gastric adenocarcinomas. The ability of grafted samples to develop lymphomas did not correlate with patient outcome, nor with the histotype, the lymphocyte infiltration level, or the EBV status of the original gastric tumor, impeding from foreseeing lymphoma onset. Interestingly, lymphoma development was significantly more frequent when primary rather than metastatic samples were grafted. Notably, the development of such lympho-proliferative disease could be prevented by a short rituximab treatment upon mice implant, without negatively affecting gastric carcinoma engraftment.

However, Notch1 can be stochastically activated to promote carcinogenesis in murine models of SCC. Activated form of Notch1 promotes xenograft tumor growth when expressed ectopically. Here, we demonstrate that Notch1 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are coupled to promote SCC tumor initiation in concert with transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 present in the tumor microenvironment. We find that TGF\u03b2 activates the transcription factor ZEB1 to repress Notch3, thereby limiting terminal differentiation. Concurrently, TGF\u03b2 drives Notch1-mediated EMT to generate tumor initiating cells characterized by high CD44 expression.

suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) may improve patient survival in PIK3CA-mutant colorectal carcinoma, but not in PIK3CA-wild-type carcinoma. However, whether aspirin directly influences the viability of PIK3CA-mutant colon cancer cells is poorly understood. We conducted in vitro experiments to test our hypothesis that the anti-proliferative activity of aspirin might be stronger for PIK3CA-mutant colon cancer cells than for PIK3CA-wild-type colon cancer cells. We measured the anti-proliferative effect of aspirin at physiologic concentrations in seven PIK3CA-mutant and six PIK3CA-wild-type human colon cancer cell lines. After exposure to aspirin, the apoptotic index and cell cycle phase of colon cancer cells were assessed. In addition, the effect of aspirin was examined in parental SW48 cells and SW48 cell clones with individual knock-in PIK3CA mutations of either c.3140A>G (p.H1047R) or c.1633G>A (p.E545K). Aspirin induced greater dose-dependent loss of cell viability in PIK3CA-mutant cells than in PIK3CA-wild-type cells after treatment for 48 and 72 hours. Aspirin treatment also led to higher proportions of apoptotic cells and G0/G1 phase arrest in PIK3CA-mutant cells than in PIK3CA-wild-type cells. Aspirin treatment of isogenic SW48 cells carrying a PIK3CA mutation, either c.3140A>G (p.H1047R) or c.1633G>A (p. E545K), resulted in a more significant loss of cell viability compared to wild-type controls. Our findings indicate that aspirin causes cell cycle arrest, induces apoptosis, and leads to loss of cell viability more profoundly in PIK3CA-mutated colon cancer cells than in PIK3CA-wild-type colon cancer cells.

Targeting tumors with kinase inhibitors induces complex adaptive programs that promote the persistence of a fraction of the original cell population, facilitating the eventual outgrowth of inhibitor-resistant tumor clones. We show that the addition of a newly identified CDK7/12 inhibitor, THZ1, to targeted therapy enhances cell killing and impedes the emergence of drug-resistant cell populations in diverse cellular and in vivo cancer models. We propose that targeted therapy induces a state of transcriptional dependency in a subpopulation of cells poised to become drug tolerant, which THZ1 can exploit by blocking dynamic transcriptional responses, promoting remodeling of enhancers and key signaling outputs required for tumor cell survival in the setting of targeted therapy. These findings suggest that the addition of THZ1 to targeted therapies is a promising broad-based strategy to hinder the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cell populations.Significance: CDK7/12 inhibition prevents active enhancer formation at genes, promoting resistance emergence in response to targeted therapy, and impedes the engagement of transcriptional programs required for tumor cell survival. CDK7/12 inhibition in combination with targeted cancer therapies may serve as a therapeutic paradigm for enhancing the effectiveness of targeted therapies.

PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) Expression and the Lymphocytic Reaction to Colorectal Cancer.", "Abstract": "Expression of the immune checkpoint ligand CD274 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, PD-L1, from gene CD274) contributes to suppression of antitumor T cell-mediated immune response in various tumor types. However, the role of PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2, CD273, from gene PDCD1LG2) in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We hypothesized that tumor PDCD1LG2 expression might be inversely associated with lymphocytic reactions to colorectal cancer. We examined tumor PDCD1LG2 expression by IHC in 823 colon and rectal carcinoma cases within two U.S.-nationwide cohort studies and categorized tumors into quartiles according to the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing carcinoma cells. We conducted multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the associations of tumor PDCD1LG2 expression with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, controlling for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long-interspersed nucleotide element-1 methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction (Ptrend = 0.0003). For a unit increase in the three-tiered ordinal categories of Crohn-like lymphoid reaction, a multivariable OR in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.67). Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was not associated with peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or patient survival (Ptrend > 0.13). Thus, tumor PDCD1LG2 expression is inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction to colorectal cancer, suggesting a possible role of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells in inhibiting the development of tertiary lymphoid tissues during colorectal carcinogenesis.

A potential reason for the failure of such therapies is that genomic profiling results could commonly differ between the primary and metastatic tumors. To evaluate genomic heterogeneity, we sequenced paired primary GEA and synchronous metastatic lesions across multiple cohorts, finding extensive differences in genomic alterations, including discrepancies in potentially clinically relevant alterations. Multiregion sequencing showed significant discrepancy within the primary tumor (PT) and between the PT and disseminated disease, with oncogene amplification profiles commonly discordant. In addition, a pilot analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing demonstrated the feasibility of detecting genomic amplifications not detected in PT sampling. Lastly, we profiled paired primary tumors, metastatic tumors, and cfDNA from patients enrolled in the personalized antibodies for GEA (PANGEA) trial of targeted therapies in GEA and found that genomic biomarkers were recurrently discrepant between the PT and untreated metastases. Divergent primary and metastatic tissue profiling led to treatment reassignment in 32% (9/28) of patients. In discordant primary and metastatic lesions, we found 87.5% concordance for targetable alterations in metastatic tissue and cfDNA, suggesting the potential for cfDNA profiling to enhance selection of therapy.Significance: We demonstrate frequent baseline heterogeneity in targetable genomic alterations in GEA, indicating that current tissue sampling practices for biomarker testing do not effectively guide precision medicine in this disease and that routine profiling of metastatic lesions and/or cfDNA should be systematically evaluated.

Applying MSMuTect to whole-exome data from 6,747 human tumors representing 20 tumor types, we identified >1,000 previously undescribed MS indels in cancer genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the number and pattern of MS indels can accurately distinguish microsatellite-stable tumors from tumors with microsatellite instability, thus potentially improving classification of clinically relevant subgroups.

However, there remains a dearth of data regarding molecular profiles that are shared across tissues, an understanding of which could lead to the development of highly versatile, broadly applicable therapies. Using data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we performed a transcriptomics-centered analysis on 1494 patient samples, comparing the two major histological subtypes of solid tumors (adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) across organs, with a focus on tissues in which both subtypes arise: esophagus, lung, and uterine cervix. Via principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis, we discovered that histology-driven differences accounted for a greater degree of inherent molecular variation in the tumors than did tissue of origin. We then analyzed differential gene expression, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA expression between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and found 1733 genes, 346 CpG sites, and 42 microRNAs in common between organ sites, indicating specific adenocarcinoma-associated and squamous cell carcinoma-associated molecular patterns that were conserved across tissues. We then identified specific pathways that may be critical to the development of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, including Liver X receptor activation, which was upregulated in adenocarcinomas but downregulated in squamous cell carcinomas, possibly indicating important differences in cancer cell metabolism between these two histological subtypes of cancer. In addition, we highlighted genes that may be common drivers of adenocarcinomas specifically, such as IGF2BP1, which suggests a possible link between embryonic development and tumor subtype. Altogether, we demonstrate the need to consider biological similarities that transcend anatomical boundaries to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Rapid epithelial renewal occurs, but the specific cell of origin that supports this high proliferative demand remains unknown. Herein, we have described a long-lived progenitor cell population in the mouse esophageal epithelium that is characterized by expression of keratin 15 (Krt15). Genetic in vivo lineage tracing revealed that the Krt15 promoter marks a long-lived basal cell population able to self-renew, proliferate, and generate differentiated cells, consistent with a progenitor/stem cell population. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly distinct from Krt15- basal cells. Depletion of Krt15-derived cells resulted in decreased proliferation, thereby leading to atrophy of the esophageal epithelium. Further, Krt15+ cells were radioresistant and contributed to esophageal epithelial regeneration following radiation-induced injury. These results establish the presence of a long-lived and indispensable Krt15+ progenitor cell population that provides additional perspective on esophageal epithelial biology and the widely prevalent diseases that afflict this epithelium.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Esophagus", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Keratin-15", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mucous Membrane", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Radiation Injuries, Experimental", "Regeneration", "Stem Cells", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "V\u00e9ronique", "Last Name": "Giroux", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ashley A", "Last Name": "Lento", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Mirazul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason R", "Last Name": "Pitarresi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Akriti", "Last Name": "Kharbanda", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Apple", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "Rhoades", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qiaosi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Lengner", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Paul", "Last Name": "Wileyto", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andres J", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2017Jun01"}, {"PMID": "28459449", "Title": "In vivo genome editing and organoid transplantation models of colorectal cancer and metastasis.", "Abstract": "In vivo interrogation of the function of genes implicated in tumorigenesis is limited by the need to generate and cross germline mutant mice.

The anatomic locations and clinical behavior also differ by geography, leading to the controversial idea that Eastern and Western forms of the disease are distinct. In view of these differences, we investigated whether gastric cancers from Eastern and Western patients show distinct genomic profiles. We used high-density profiling of somatic copy-number aberrations to analyze the largest collection to date of gastric adenocarcinomas and utilized genotyping data to rigorously annotate ethnic status. The size of this collection allowed us to accurately identify regions of significant copy-number alteration and separately to evaluate tumors arising in Eastern and Western patients. Among molecular subtypes classified by The Cancer Genome Atlas, the frequency of gastric cancers showing chromosomal instability was modestly higher in Western patients. After accounting for this difference, however, gastric cancers arising in Easterners and Westerners have highly similar somatic copy-number patterns. Only one genomic event, focal deletion of the phosphatase gene PTPRD, was significantly enriched in Western cases, though also detected in Eastern cases. Thus, despite the different risk factors and clinical features, gastric cancer appears to be a fundamentally similar disease in both populations and the divergent clinical outcomes cannot be ascribed to different underlying structural somatic genetic aberrations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Asian People", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Humans", "Stomach Neoplasms", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Schumacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Byoung Yong", "Last Name": "Shim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Corso", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Pathology, University Hospital, Siena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Min-Hee", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yoon-Koo", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Franco", "Last Name": "Roviello", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Pathology, University Hospital, Siena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Saksena", "Affiliation": "Cancer Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shouyong", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ramesh A", "Last Name": "Shivdasani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rameen", "Last Name": "Beroukhim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28387316", "Title": "Lkb1 inactivation drives lung cancer lineage switching governed by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.", "Abstract": "Adenosquamous lung tumours, which are extremely poor prognosis, may result from cellular plasticity.

We sought to characterize immune cell infiltrates and the expression of T-cell inhibitor markers in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative malignant pleural mesothelioma samples. We developed a method for immune cell phenotyping using flow cytometry on solid tumors that have been dissociated into single-cell suspensions and applied this technique to analyze 43 resected malignant pleural mesothelioma specimens. Compared with PD-L1-negative tumors, PD-L1-positive tumors had significantly more infiltrating CD45+ immune cells, a significantly higher proportion of infiltrating CD3+ T cells, and a significantly higher percentage of CD3+ cells displaying the activated HLA-DR+/CD38+ phenotype. PD-L1-positive tumors also had a significantly higher proportion of proliferating CD8+ T cells, a higher fraction of FOXP3+/CD4+ Tregs, and increased expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Double-positive PD-1+/TIM-3+ CD8+ T cells were more commonly found on PD-L1-positive tumors. Compared with epithelioid tumors, sarcomatoid and biphasic mesothelioma samples were significantly more likely to be PD-L1 positive and showed more infiltration with CD3+ T cells and PD-1+/TIM-3+ CD8+ T cells. Immunologic phenotypes in mesothelioma differ based on PD-L1 status and histologic subtype.

Immune checkpoint blockade improves survival in a subset of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but robust biomarkers that predict response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors are lacking. Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. METHODS. We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically \"hot\" cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically \"cold\" cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The \"hot\" cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the \"hot\" cluster. Additionally, approximately 20% of cases had high B cell infiltrates with a subset producing IL-10. CONCLUSIONS. Our results support the use of immune-based metrics to study response and resistance to immunotherapy in lung cancer. FUNDING. The Robert A. and Ren\u00e9e E.

Recent studies with PD-1 inhibition have shown promising results in GC, but key questions remain regarding which GC subclass may respond best. In other cancers, expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 has been shown to identify cancers with greater likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade. We here show with immunohistochemistry that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)+ GCs (n = 32) have robust PD-L1 expression not seen in other GCs. In EBV+ GC, we observed PD-L1 staining in tumor cells in 50% (16/32) and immune cells in 94% (30/32) of cases. Among EBV-negative GCs, PD-L1 expression within tumors cells was observed only in cases with microsatellite instability (MSI), although 35% of EBV-/MSS GCs possessed PD-L1 expression of inflammatory cells. Moreover, distinct classes of GC showed different patterns of PD-L1+ immune cell infiltrations. In both EBV+ and MSI tumors, PD-L1+ inflammatory cells were observed to infiltrate the tumor. By contrast, such cells remained at the tumor border of EBV-/MSS GCs. Consistent with these findings, we utilized gene expression profiling of GCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas study to demonstrate that an interferon-\u03b3 driven gene signature, an additional proposed marker of sensitivity to PD-1 therapy, were enriched in EBV+ and MSI GC. These data suggest that patients with EBV+ and MSI GC may have greater likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade and that EBV and MSI status should be evaluated as variables in clinical trials of these emerging inhibitors.", "Keywords": ["EBV-infected gastric cancers", "MSI gastric cancer", "PD-1 inhibitors", "PD-L1"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Epstein-Barr Virus Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Male", "Microsatellite Instability", "Middle Aged", "Stomach Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Derks", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyun", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna M", "Last Name": "Chiaravalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Ospedale di Circolo, Varese, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Xinsen", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Constanza", "Last Name": "Camargo", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Enrico", "Last Name": "Solcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia and Policlinico S.

Experimental evidence suggests that microRNA MIR21 (miR-21) suppresses antitumor T-cell-mediated immunity. Thus, we hypothesized that tumor MIR21 expression might be inversely associated with T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue. Using 538 rectal and colon cancer cases from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we measured tumor MIR21 expression by a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assay. Densities of CD3(+), CD8(+), CD45RO (PTPRC)(+), and FOXP3(+) cells in tumor tissue were determined by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association of MIR21 expression (ordinal quartiles as a predictor variable) with T-cell density (ordinal quartiles as an outcome variable), adjusting for tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability; CpG island methylator phenotype; KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations; and LINE-1 methylation.

Epithelial PD-L1 was expressed on only 2% of cases, although PD-L1(+) immune cells were observed in 18% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. We also evaluated expression in the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett's esophagus, which emerges following gastric reflux-induced esophageal inflammation, and found PD-L2 expression in Barrett's esophagus but not in non-Barrett's esophagus esophagitis. Because the progression from squamous esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus is accompanied by a transition from a TH1 to TH2 immune response, we hypothesized that the TH2 cytokines IL4/IL13 could contribute to PD-L2 induction. We confirmed that these cytokines can augment PD-L2 expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. These results suggest that the inflammatory environment in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma may contribute to the expression of PD-L2.

Technological advancements to interrogate omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, interactomics, etc.) provide widely open opportunities in population-based research. Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) represents integrative science of molecular pathology and epidemiology. This unified paradigm requires multidisciplinary collaboration between pathology, epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and computational biology. Integration of these fields enables better understanding of etiologic heterogeneity, disease continuum, causal inference, and the impact of environment, diet, lifestyle, host factors (including genetics and immunity), and their interactions on disease evolution. Hence, the Second International MPE Meeting was held in Boston in December 2014, with aims to: (1) develop conceptual and practical frameworks; (2) cultivate and expand opportunities; (3) address challenges; and (4) initiate the effort of specifying guidelines for MPE. The meeting mainly consisted of presentations of method developments and recent data in various malignant neoplasms and tumors (breast, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancers, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia), followed by open discussion sessions on challenges and future plans. In particular, we recognized need for efforts to further develop statistical methodologies. This meeting provided an unprecedented opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, consistent with the purposes of the Big Data to Knowledge, Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology, and Precision Medicine Initiative of the US National Institute of Health.

To elucidate the role of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) mediated by menin-HMT complexes during PanNET formation, genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) signals were mapped in pancreatic islets using unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Integrative analysis of gene expression profiles and histone H3K4me3 levels identified a number of transcripts and target genes dependent on menin. In the absence of Men1, histone H3K27me3 levels are enriched, with a concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 within the promoters of these target genes. In particular, expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) gene is subject to dynamic epigenetic regulation by Men1-dependent histone modification in a time-dependent manner. Decreased expression of IGF2BP2 in Men1-deficient hyperplastic pancreatic islets is partially reversed by ablation of RBP2 (KDM5A), a histone H3K4-specific demethylase of the jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 1 (JARID1) family.

To investigate the potential reasons for the modest impact of ERBB2-directed therapies, we explored the hypothesis that secondary molecular features of ERBB2-amplified GE adenocarcinomas attenuate the impact of ERBB2 blockade. We analyzed genomic profiles of ERBB2-amplified GE adenocarcinomas and determined that the majority of ERBB2-amplified tumors harbor secondary oncogenic alterations that have the potential to be therapeutically targeted. These secondary events spanned genes involved in cell-cycle regulation as well as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Using ERBB2-amplified cell lines, we demonstrated that secondary oncogenic events could confer resistance to ERBB2-directed therapies. Moreover, this resistance could be overcome by targeting the secondary oncogene in conjunction with ERBB2-directed therapy. EGFR is commonly coamplified with ERBB2, and in the setting of ERBB2 amplification, higher EGFR expression appears to mark tumors with greater sensitivity to dual EGFR/ERBB2 kinase inhibitors.

However, there is little knowledge of the mechanisms by which these tumors develop acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. To investigate this question we sought to characterize cell line models of ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. We generated lapatinib-resistant (LR) subclones from an initially lapatinib-sensitive ERBB2-amplified esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, OE19. We subsequently performed genomic characterization and functional analyses of resistant subclones with acquired lapatinib resistance. We identified a novel, acquired SrcE527K mutation in a subset of LR OE19 subclones. Cells with this mutant allele harbour increased Src phosphorylation. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Src resensitized these subclones to lapatinib. Biochemically, Src mutations could activate both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase pathways in the lapatinib-treated LR OE19 cells. Ectopic expression of SrcE527K mutation also was sufficient to induce lapatinib resistance in drug-na\u00efve cells. These results indicate that pathologic activation of Src is a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer. Although Src mutation has not been described in primary tumor samples, we propose that the Src hyperactivation should be investigated in the settings of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Benzodioxoles", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Gene Amplification", "Gene Expression", "Gene Silencing", "Genes, src", "Humans", "Lapatinib", "Mutation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Quinazolines", "RNA Interference", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Stomach Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yong Sang", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jihun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eirini", "Last Name": "Pectasides", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cameron", "Last Name": "Fox", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Seung-Woo", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Qiuping", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gabrielle S", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shouyong", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Cancer Program, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Stachler", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Aaron R", "Last Name": "Thorner", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Van Hummelen", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Cancer Program, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "25026207", "Title": "RhoA mutations identified in diffuse gastric cancer.", "Abstract": "The diffuse-type histologic variant of gastric cancer is characterized by highly invasive growth patterns and\u00a0lack of cellular cohesion.

However, the role of JAK-STAT pathway activation in different MPNs, and in patients without JAK2 mutations, has not been definitively delineated. We used expression profiling, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and mutational profiling to investigate a well-characterized cohort of MPN patients. MPN patients with homozygous JAK2V617F mutations were characterized by a distinctive transcriptional profile. Notably, a transcriptional signature consistent with activated JAK2 signaling is seen in all MPN patients regardless of clinical phenotype or mutational status. In addition, the activated JAK2 signature was present in patients with somatic CALR mutations.

We previously reported that SOX2 is an oncogene and subject to highly recurrent genomic amplification in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Here, we have further characterized the function of SOX2 in SCC. Using ChIP-seq analysis, we compared SOX2-regulated gene profiles in multiple SCC cell lines to ES cell profiles and determined that SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs. In SCCs, SOX2 preferentially interacts with the transcription factor p63, as opposed to the transcription factor OCT4, which is the preferred SOX2 binding partner in ES cells. SOX2 and p63 exhibited overlapping genomic occupancy at a large number of loci in SCCs; however, coordinate binding of SOX2 and p63 was absent in ES cells. We further demonstrated that SOX2 and p63 jointly regulate gene expression, including the oncogene ETV4, which was essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that the action of SOX2 in SCC differs substantially from its role in pluripotency. The identification of the SCC-associated interaction between SOX2 and p63 will enable deeper characterization the downstream targets of this interaction in SCC and normal squamous epithelial physiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenovirus E1A Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Chromatiaceae", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Amplification", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Octamer Transcription Factor-3", "Oncogenes", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Protein Binding", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hideo", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qiuping", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shouyong", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guillaume", "Last Name": "Adelmant", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Swain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wenyu", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cameron", "Last Name": "Fox", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua M", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chandra Sekhar", "Last Name": "Pedamallu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "DeLuca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angela N", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Su", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kwok-kin", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Keith L", "Last Name": "Ligon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "X Shirley", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jarrod A", "Last Name": "Marto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Meyerson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24509200", "Title": "Comparison of cancer-associated genetic abnormalities in columnar-lined esophagus tissues with and without goblet cells.", "Abstract": "To determine and compare the frequency of cancer-associated genetic abnormalities in esophageal metaplasia biopsies with and without goblet cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Barrett Esophagus", "Biopsy", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "DNA, Neoplasm", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagus", "Female", "Genes, p16", "Goblet Cells", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Male", "Metaplasia", "Mutation", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Precancerous Conditions", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Santhoshi", "Last Name": "Bandla", "Affiliation": "*Departments of Surgery \u2021Pathology, and \u2016Biostatistics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, NY \u2020Life Technologies, Foster City, CA **Dana Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA \u2020\u2020University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI \u00b6University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA;

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SqCC), recent studies have suggested that DDR2 mutations are a biomarker for therapeutic response to dasatinib and clinical trials are underway testing this hypothesis. Although targeted therapeutics are typically quite effective as initial therapy for patients with lung cancer, nearly all patients develop resistance with long-term exposure to targeted drugs. Here, we use DDR2-dependent lung cancer cell lines to model acquired resistance to dasatinib therapy. We perform targeted exome sequencing to identify two distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance: acquisition of the T654I gatekeeper mutation in DDR2 and loss of NF1. We show that NF1 loss activates a bypass pathway, which confers ERK dependency downstream of RAS activation. These results indicate that acquired resistance to dasatinib can occur via both second-site mutations in DDR2 and by activation of bypass pathways. These data may help to anticipate mechanisms of resistance that may be identified in upcoming clinical trials of anti-DDR2 therapy in lung cancer and suggest strategies to overcome resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Dasatinib", "Discoidin Domain Receptors", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Exome", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mutation", "Neurofibromin 1", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrimidines", "RNA Interference", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Receptors, Mitogen", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Thiazoles", "ras Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ellen M", "Last Name": "Beauchamp", "Affiliation": "Corresponding Author: Peter S.

With a 5-year survival rate of ~15%, the identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is greatly important. We analyze the mutation spectra from whole-exome sequencing of 149 EAC tumor-normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole-genome sequencing. We identify a mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A>C transversions at AA dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of exome data identified 26 significantly mutated genes. Of these genes, five (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, ARID1A and PIK3CA) have previously been implicated in EAC. The new significantly mutated genes include chromatin-modifying factors and candidate contributors SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1 and DOCK2. Functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 identifies increased cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway as a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Chromosome Mapping", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Exome", "Gene Rearrangement", "Genome, Human", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Invasiveness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Austin M", "Last Name": "Dulak", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Petar", "Last Name": "Stojanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shouyong", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cameron", "Last Name": "Fox", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chip", "Last Name": "Stewart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Santhoshi", "Last Name": "Bandla", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Imamura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Schumacher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Shefler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "McKenna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott L", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristian", "Last Name": "Cibulskis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrey", "Last Name": "Sivachenko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Saksena", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Douglas", "Last Name": "Voet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alex H", "Last Name": "Ramos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Auclair", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "Sougnez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Onofrio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Candace", "Last Name": "Guiducci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rameen", "Last Name": "Beroukhim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhongren", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jules", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rishindra", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Landrenau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arjun", "Last Name": "Pennathur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shuji", "Last Name": "Ogino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Luketich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd R", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stacey B", "Last Name": "Gabriel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric S", "Last Name": "Lander", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Beer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tony E", "Last Name": "Godfrey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gad", "Last Name": "Getz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature genetics", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23472866", "Title": "An inflammatory situation: SOX2 and STAT3 cooperate in squamous cell carcinoma initiation.", "Abstract": "Although SOX2 has been identified as a squamous cell carcinoma oncogene, mechanisms of SOX2-induce oncogenesis have remained elusive.

Activating mutations in NRAS occur in a subset of colorectal cancers, but little is known about how the mutant protein contributes to the onset and progression of the disease. Using genetically engineered mice, we find that mutant N-RAS strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation. The protumorigenic nature of mutant N-RAS is related to its antiapoptotic function, which is mediated by activation of a noncanonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that signals through STAT3. As a result, inhibition of MAP-ERK kinase selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-RAS. The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for patients with colorectal cancer.
