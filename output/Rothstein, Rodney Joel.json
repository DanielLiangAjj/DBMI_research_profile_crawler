To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template. By use of additional gRNAs, we find that the RCNA pathway is especially important to repair a leading strand fork collapse.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Kimble", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aakanksha", "Last Name": "Sane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert Jd", "Last Name": "Reid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lorraine S", "Last Name": "Symington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun19"}, {"PMID": "38772725", "Title": "Corrigendum: Defining the influence of Rad51 and Dmc1 lineage-specific amino acids on genetic recombination.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin B", "Last Name": "Steinfeld", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ondrej", "Last Name": "Bel\u00e1\u0148", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youngho", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tsuyoshi", "Last Name": "Terakawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amr", "Last Name": "Al-Zain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Brooks", "Last Name": "Crickard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhi", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weixing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lorraine S", "Last Name": "Symington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Sung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simon J", "Last Name": "Boulton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric C", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "38214234", "Title": "Aberrant DNA repair reveals a vulnerability in histone H3.3-mutant brain tumors.", "Abstract": "Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) are devastating and incurable brain tumors with recurrent mutations in histone H3.3.

The two most frequent H3.3 mutations in pHGG, K27M and G34R, drive aberrant repair of replication-associated damage by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

Increased nuclear exploration is regulated by the recombination machinery and the DNA damage checkpoint and is likely an important aspect of homology search. While mobility in response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in S phase, the response in interphase has not, and the question of whether homologous recombination proceeds to completion in G1 phase remains controversial. Here, we find that global mobility is triggered in G1 phase. As in S phase, global mobility in G1 phase is controlled by the DNA damage checkpoint and the Rad51 recombinase. Interestingly, despite the restriction of Rad52 mediator foci to S phase, Rad51 foci form at high levels in G1 phase.

Here, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids conserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family.

In response to double-strand breaks, chromatin is more mobile at large time scales but, surprisingly, its mobility is reduced at short time scales. This effect is even more pronounced at the site of damage. Such a pattern of dynamics is consistent with a global increase in chromatin persistence length in response to DNA damage.

Although many of the biochemical steps of HR are known, the physical movements of chromosomes that must underlie the pairing of homologous sequence during mitotic DSB repair have remained mysterious. Recently, several groups have begun to use a variety of genetic and cell biological tools to study this important question. These studies reveal that both damaged and undamaged loci increase the volume of the nuclear space that they explore after the formation of DSBs. This DSB-induced increase in chromosomal mobility is regulated by many of the same factors that are important during HR, such as ATR-dependent checkpoint activation and the recombinase Rad51, suggesting that this phenomenon may facilitate the search for homology. In this perspective, we review current research into the mobility of chromosomal loci during HR, as well as possible underlying mechanisms, and discuss the critical questions that remain to be answered.

CKS1B codes for a conserved regulatory subunit of cyclin-CDK complexes that function at multiple stages of cell cycle progression. We used a high throughput screening protocol to mimic cancer-related overexpression in a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants to identify genes whose functions become essential only when CKS1 is overexpressed, a synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interaction. Mutations in multiple genes affecting mitotic entry and mitotic exit are highly enriched in the set of SDL interactions. The interactions between Cks1 and the mitotic entry checkpoint genes require the inhibitory activity of Swe1 on the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc28. In addition, the SDL interactions of overexpressed CKS1 with mutations in the mitotic exit network are suppressed by modulating expression of the CDK inhibitor Sic1. Mutation of the polo-like kinase Cdc5, which functions in both the mitotic entry and mitotic exit pathways, is lethal in combination with overexpressed CKS1 Therefore we investigated the effect of targeting the human Cdc5 ortholog, PLK1, in breast cancers with various expression levels of human CKS1B Growth inhibition by PLK1 knockdown correlates with increased CKS1B expression in published tumor cell data sets, and this correlation was confirmed using shRNAs against PLK1 in tumor cell lines. In addition, we overexpressed CKS1B in multiple cell lines and found increased sensitivity to PLK1 knockdown and PLK1 drug inhibition. Finally, combined inhibition of WEE1 and PLK1 results in less apoptosis than predicted based on an additive model of the individual inhibitors, showing an epistatic interaction and confirming a prediction of the yeast data.

When the telomeres become very short, cells enter a state that blocks cell division, termed senescence. A subset of these cells can overcome senescence and maintain their telomeres using telomerase-independent mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these cells are called 'survivors' and are dependent on Rad52-dependent homologous recombination and Pol32-dependent break-induced replication. There are two main types of survivors: type I and type II. The type I survivors require Rad51 and maintain telomeres by amplification of subtelomeric elements, while the type II survivors are Rad51-independent, but require the MRX complex and Sgs1 to amplify the C1-3A/TG1-3 telomeric sequences. Rad52, Pol32, Rad51, and Sgs1 are also important to prevent accelerated senescence, indicating that recombination processes are important at telomeres even before the formation of survivors. The Shu complex, which consists of Shu1, Shu2, Psy3, and Csm2, promotes Rad51-dependent homologous recombination and has been suggested to be important for break-induced replication. It also promotes the formation of recombination intermediates that are processed by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex, as mutations in the SHU genes can suppress various sgs1, top3, and rmi1 mutant phenotypes. Given the importance of recombination processes during senescence and survivor formation, and the involvement of the Shu complex in many of the same processes during DNA repair, we hypothesized that the Shu complex may also have functions at telomeres. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case: the Shu complex does not affect the rate of senescence, does not influence survivor formation, and deletion of SHU1 does not suppress the rapid senescence and type II survivor formation defect of a telomerase-negative sgs1 mutant.

Although its activity has been implicated in several steps of HR, its exact role(s) at each step are still not fully understood. We have identified a new interaction between Rad54 and the replicative DNA clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction was only mildly weakened by the mutation of two key hydrophobic residues in the highly-conserved PCNA interaction motif (PIP-box) of Rad54 (Rad54-AA). Intriguingly, the rad54-AA mutant cells displayed sensitivity to DNA damage and showed HR defects similar to the null mutant, despite retaining its ability to interact with HR proteins and to be recruited to HR foci in vivo. We therefore surmised that the PCNA interaction might be impaired in vivo and was unable to promote repair synthesis during HR. Indeed, the Rad54-AA mutant was defective in primer extension at the MAT locus as well as in vitro, but additional biochemical analysis revealed that this mutant also had diminished ATPase activity and an inability to promote D-loop formation. Further mutational analysis of the putative PIP-box uncovered that other phenotypically relevant mutants in this domain also resulted in a loss of ATPase activity. Therefore, we have found that although Rad54 interacts with PCNA, the PIP-box motif likely plays only a minor role in stabilizing the PCNA interaction, and rather, this conserved domain is probably an extension of the ATPase domain III.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Chromosome Pairing", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA", "DNA Damage", "DNA Helicases", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "DNA Primers", "DNA Repair", "DNA Repair Enzymes", "Genomic Instability", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Recombination, Genetic", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca C", "Last Name": "Burgess", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Sebesta", "Affiliation": "National Centre for Biomolecular Research, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic ; Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic ; International Clinical Research Centre, Centre for Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering, Saint Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Sisakova", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic ; International Clinical Research Centre, Centre for Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering, Saint Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Victoria P", "Last Name": "Marini", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Lisby", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Jiri", "Last Name": "Damborsky", "Affiliation": "International Clinical Research Centre, Centre for Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering, Saint Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic ; Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lumir", "Last Name": "Krejci", "Affiliation": "National Centre for Biomolecular Research, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic ; Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic ; International Clinical Research Centre, Centre for Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering, Saint Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "24344201", "Title": "Phosphorylation-regulated transitions in an oligomeric state control the activity of the Sae2 DNA repair enzyme.", "Abstract": "In the DNA damage response, many repair and signaling molecules mobilize rapidly at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. This network of immediate responses is regulated at the level of posttranslational modifications that control the activation of DNA processing enzymes, protein kinases, and scaffold proteins to coordinate DNA repair and checkpoint signaling. Here we investigated the DNA damage-induced oligomeric transitions of the Sae2 protein, an important enzyme in the initiation of DNA double-strand break repair. Sae2 is a target of multiple phosphorylation events, which we identified and characterized in vivo in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both cell cycle-dependent and DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation sites in Sae2 are important for the survival of DNA damage, and the cell cycle-regulated modifications are required to prime the damage-dependent events. We found that Sae2 exists in the form of inactive oligomers that are transiently released into smaller active units by this series of phosphorylations. DNA damage also triggers removal of Sae2 through autophagy and proteasomal degradation, ensuring that active Sae2 is present only transiently in cells.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in the RecQ homolog, SGS1, phenocopy many of the defects observed in the human syndromes. One challenge to studying RecQ helicases is that their disruption leads to a pleiotropic phenotype. Using yeast, we show that the separation-of-function allele of SGS1, sgs1-D664\u0394, has impaired activity at DNA ends, resulting in a resection processivity defect. Compromising Sgs1 resection function in the absence of the Sae2 nuclease causes slow growth, which is alleviated by making the DNA ends accessible to Exo1 nuclease. Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy studies reveal that, when Sgs1 resection activity is compromised in sae2\u0394 cells, Mre11 repair foci persist.

Consequently, when members of this complex are disrupted, cells exhibit a mutator phenotype, sensitivity to DNA damage reagents and increased gross chromosomal rearrangements. Previously, we found that the Shu complex plays an important role in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) recombination when the Upstream Activating Factor (UAF) protein Uaf30 is disrupted. UAF30 encodes a protein needed for rDNA transcription and when deleted, rDNA recombination increases and the rDNA expands in a Shu1-dependent manner. Here we find using the uaf30-sensitized background that the central DNA repair protein Rad52, which is normally excluded from the nucleolus, frequently overlaps with the rDNA. This close association of Rad52 with the rDNA is dependent upon Shu1 in a uaf30 mutant. Previously, it was shown that in the absence of Rad52 sumoylation, Rad52 foci mislocalize to the nucleolus. Interestingly, here we find that using the uaf30 sensitized background the ability to regulate Rad52 sumoylation is important for Shu1 dependent rDNA recombination as well as Rad52 close association with rDNA. Our results suggest that in the absence of UAF30, the Shu complex plays a central role in Rad52 rDNA localization as long as Rad52 can be sumoylated.

For these studies, statistical models are typically used to determine significance cutoffs. We developed a method termed \"CLIK\" (Cutoff Linked to Interaction Knowledge) that overlays biological knowledge from the interactome on screen results to derive a cutoff. The method takes advantage of the fact that groups of functionally related interacting genes often respond similarly to experimental conditions and, thus, cluster in a ranked list of screen results. We applied CLIK analysis to five screens of the yeast gene disruption library and found that it defined a significance cutoff that differed from traditional statistics. Importantly, verification experiments revealed that the CLIK cutoff correlated with the position in the rank order where the rate of true positives drops off significantly. In addition, the gene sets defined by CLIK analysis often provide further biological perspectives. For example, applying CLIK analysis retrospectively to a screen for cisplatin sensitivity allowed us to identify the importance of the Hrq1 helicase in DNA crosslink repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of CLIK to determine optimal treatment conditions by analyzing genome-wide screens at multiple rapamycin concentrations. We show that CLIK is an extremely useful tool for evaluating screen quality, determining screen cutoffs, and comparing results between screens. Furthermore, because CLIK uses previously annotated interaction data to determine biologically informed cutoffs, it provides additional insights into screen results, which supplement traditional statistical approaches.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cisplatin", "Genome, Fungal", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Mutation", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Signal Transduction", "Sirolimus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Dittmar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J D", "Last Name": "Reid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Apr30"}, {"PMID": "23357952", "Title": "Histone H3K56 acetylation, Rad52, and non-DNA repair factors control double-strand break repair choice with the sister chromatid.", "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions that arise mainly during replication. The choice of the sister chromatid as the preferential repair template is critical for genome integrity, but the mechanisms that guarantee this choice are unknown. Here we identify new genes with a specific role in assuring the sister chromatid as the preferred repair template. Physical analyses of sister chromatid recombination (SCR) in 28 selected mutants that increase Rad52 foci and inter-homolog recombination uncovered 8 new genes required for SCR. These include the SUMO/Ub-SUMO protease Wss1, the stress-response proteins Bud27 and Pdr10, the ADA histone acetyl-transferase complex proteins Ahc1 and Ada2, as well as the Hst3 and Hst4 histone deacetylase and the Rtt109 histone acetyl-transferase genes, whose target is histone H3 Lysine 56 (H3K56). Importantly, we use mutations in H3K56 residue to A, R, and Q to reveal that H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation is critical to promote SCR as the major repair mechanism for replication-born DSBs. The same phenotype is observed for a particular class of rad52 alleles, represented by rad52-C180A, with a DSB repair defect but a spontaneous hyper-recombination phenotype. We propose that specific Rad52 residues, as well as the histone H3 acetylation/deacetylation state of chromatin and other specific factors, play an important role in identifying the sister as the choice template for the repair of replication-born DSBs. Our work demonstrates the existence of specific functions to guarantee SCR as the main repair event for replication-born DSBs that can occur by two pathways, one Rad51-dependent and the other Pol32-dependent.

Cells counteract this shortening by employing a specialized reverse transcriptase called telomerase, which uses deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to extend telomeres. Intracellular dNTP levels are tightly regulated, and perturbation of these levels is known to affect DNA synthesis. We examined whether altering the levels of the dNTP pools or changing the relative ratios of the four dNTPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae would affect the length of the telomeres. Lowering dNTP levels leads to a modest shortening of telomeres, while increasing dNTP pools has no significant effect on telomere length. Strikingly, altering the ratio of the four dNTPs dramatically affects telomere length homeostasis, both positively and negatively. Specifically, we find that intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) levels positively correlate with both telomere length and telomerase nucleotide addition processivity in vivo.
