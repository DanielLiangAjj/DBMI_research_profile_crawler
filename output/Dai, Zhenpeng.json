Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of skin-infiltrating immune cells from the graft-induced C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA, coupled with antibody-based depletion to interrogate the functional role of specific cell types in AA in vivo. Since AA is predominantly T cell-mediated, we focused on dissecting lymphocyte function in AA. Both our scRNAseq and functional studies established CD8+ T cells as the primary disease-driving cell type in AA. Only the depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, NK, B, or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, was sufficient to prevent and reverse AA. Selective depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) showed that Treg are protective against AA in C3H/HeJ mice, suggesting that failure of Treg-mediated immunosuppression is not a major disease mechanism in AA. Focused analyses of CD8+ T cells revealed five subsets, whose heterogeneity is defined by an \"effectorness gradient\" of interrelated transcriptional states that culminate in increased effector function and tissue residency. scRNAseq of human AA skin showed that CD8+ T cells in human AA follow a similar trajectory, underscoring that shared mechanisms drive disease in both murine and human AA. Our study represents a comprehensive, systematic interrogation of lymphocyte heterogeneity in AA and uncovers a novel framework for AA-associated CD8+ T cells with implications for the design of future therapeutics.", "Keywords": ["T cells", "alopecia areata", "autoimmunity", "hair follicle", "single-cell RNA sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "Alopecia Areata", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eunice Y", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Zhenpeng", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Abhinav", "Last Name": "Jaiswal", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10021."}, {"First Name": "Eddy Hsi Chun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Niroshana", "Last Name": "Anandasabapathy", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10021."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jul18"}, {"PMID": "36203601", "Title": "Induction of T cell exhaustion by JAK1/3 inhibition in the treatment of alopecia areata.", "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of the hair follicle (HF). Therefore, approaches that effectively disrupt pathogenic T cell responses are predicted to have therapeutic benefit for AA treatment.

Ifidancitinib is a potent and selective next-generation JAK1/3 inhibitor predicted to disrupt \u03b3c cytokine signaling. We found that Ifidancitinib robustly induced hair regrowth in AA-affected C3H/HeJ mice when fed with Ifidancitinib in chow diets. Skin taken from Ifidancitinib-treated mice showed significantly decreased AA-associated inflammation. CD44+CD62L- CD8+ T effector/memory cells, which are associated with the pathogenesis of AA, were significantly decreased in the peripheral lymphoid organs in Ifidancitinib-treated mice. We observed high expression of co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 on effector/memory CD8+ T cells, together with decreased IFN-\u03b3 production in Ifidancitinib-treated mice.

Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) response and upregulation of several \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c) cytokines known to promote the activation and survival of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells. Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-\u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-15 receptor \u03b2 (IL-15R\u03b2) prevented disease development, reducing the accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b3c cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK inhibition in human AA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alopecia Areata", "Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Janus Kinases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Skin", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luzhou", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.
