Due to the heterogeneity of APOs, only few genetic associations have been identified. In this report, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 479 traits that are possibly related to APOs using a large and racially diverse study, Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b). To display extensive results, we developed a web-based tool GnuMoM2b (https://gnumom2b.cumcobgyn.org/) for searching, visualizing, and sharing results from a GWAS of 479 pregnancy traits as well as phenome-wide association studies of more than 17 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. The genetic results from 3 ancestries (Europeans, Africans, and Admixed Americans) and meta-analyses are populated in GnuMoM2b.

Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

Altogether, we identified 18 independent loci associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia and/or gestational hypertension, 12 of which are new (for example, MTHFR-CLCN6, WNT3A, NPR3, PGR and RGL3), including two loci (PLCE1 and FURIN) identified in the multitrait analysis. Identified loci highlight the role of natriuretic peptide signaling, angiogenesis, renal glomerular function, trophoblast development and immune dysregulation. We derived genome-wide polygenic risk scores that predicted preeclampsia/eclampsia and gestational hypertension in external cohorts, independent of clinical risk factors, and reclassified eligibility for low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) incorporated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) cohorts as a reference panel to detect associations with the phenotype at the gene level and have been gaining popularity in recent years. For nicotine addiction, several important susceptible genetic variants were identified by GWAS, but TWAS that detected genes associated with nicotine addiction and unveiled the underlying molecular mechanism were still lacking. In this study, we used eQTL data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium as a reference panel to conduct tissue-specific TWAS on cigarettes per day (CPD) over thirteen brain tissues in two large cohorts: UK Biobank (UKBB; number of participants (N) = 142,202) and the GWAS & Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN; N = 143,210), then meta-analyzing the results across tissues while considering the heterogeneity across tissues. We identified three major clusters of genes with different meta-patterns across tissues consistent in both cohorts, including homogenous genes associated with CPD in all brain tissues; partially homogeneous genes associated with CPD in cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus tissues; and, lastly, the tissue-specific genes associated with CPD in only a few specific brain tissues.

In other words, environmental effects on an outcome could be mediated by DNA methylation. To date, single CpG-site-based mediation analysis has been employed extensively. More recently, however, there has been considerable interest in studying differentially methylated regions (DMRs), both because DMRs are more likely to have functional effects than single CpG sites and because testing DMRs reduces multiple testing. In this report, we propose a novel causal mediation approach under the counterfactual framework to test the significance of total (TE), direct (DE), and indirect effects (IE) of predictors on response variable with a methylated region (MR) as the mediator (denoted as MR-Mediation). Functional linear transformation is used to reduce the possible high dimension of the CpG sites in a predefined MR and to account for their location information. In our simulation studies, MR-Mediation retained the desired Type I error rates for TE, DE, and IE tests. Furthermore, MR-Mediation had better power performance than testing mean methylation level as the mediator in most considered scenarios, especially for IE (i.e., mediated effect) test, which could be more interesting than the other two effect tests.

Puerto\u00a0Ricans.", "Abstract": "Puerto Ricans are disproportionately affected with asthma in the USA. In this study, we aim to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to asthma in Puerto Ricans.We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma in Puerto Ricans, including participants from: the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans (GALA) I-II, the Hartford-Puerto Rico Study and the Hispanic Community Health Study. Moreover, we examined whether susceptibility loci identified in previous meta-analyses of GWAS are associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans.The only locus to achieve genome-wide significance was chromosome 17q21, as evidenced by our top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs907092 (OR 0.71, p=1.2\u00d710-12) at IKZF3 Similar to results in non-Puerto Ricans, SNPs in genes in the same linkage disequilibrium block as IKZF3 (e.g. ZPBP2, ORMDL3 and GSDMB) were significantly associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans. With regard to results from a meta-analysis in Europeans, we replicated findings for rs2305480 at GSDMB, but not for SNPs in any other genes. On the other hand, we replicated results from a meta-analysis of North American populations for SNPs at IL1RL1, TSLP and GSDMB but not for IL33Our findings suggest that common variants on chromosome 17q21 have the greatest effects on asthma in Puerto Ricans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Asthma", "Child", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Puerto Rico", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Brehm", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Pino-Yanes", "Affiliation": "CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Erick", "Last Name": "Forno", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerome", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Dept of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam S", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Dept of Medicine, University of California San\u00a0Francisco, San\u00a0Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edna", "Last Name": "Acosta-Perez", "Affiliation": "Behavioral Sciences Research Institute, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico."}, {"First Name": "Cathy C", "Last Name": "Laurie", "Affiliation": "Dept of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle M", "Last Name": "Cloutier", "Affiliation": "Dept of Pediatrics, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin A", "Last Name": "Raby", "Affiliation": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Dept of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adrienne M", "Last Name": "Stilp", "Affiliation": "Dept of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamar", "Last Name": "Sofer", "Affiliation": "Dept of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donglei", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Dept of Medicine, University of California San\u00a0Francisco, San\u00a0Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Huntsman", "Affiliation": "Dept of Medicine, University of California San\u00a0Francisco, San\u00a0Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Celeste S", "Last Name": "Eng", "Affiliation": "Dept of Medicine, University of California San\u00a0Francisco, San\u00a0Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "Conomos", "Affiliation": "Dept of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deepa", "Last Name": "Rastogi", "Affiliation": "Dept of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Rice", "Affiliation": "Dept of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Glorisa", "Last Name": "Canino", "Affiliation": "Behavioral Sciences Research Institute, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Dept of Epidemiology, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Esteban G", "Last Name": "Burchard", "Affiliation": "Dept of Medicine, University of California San\u00a0Francisco, San\u00a0Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan C", "Last Name": "Celed\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA juan.celedon@chp.edu."}], "Journal": "The European respiratory journal", "PubDate": "2017May"}]
