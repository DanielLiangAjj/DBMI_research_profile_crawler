crucial system that regulates selective brain circulation with the periphery, as an example, allowing necessary nutrients to enter and expel excessive amino acids or toxins from the brain. To model how the BBB can be compromised in diseases like vascular dementia (VaD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), researchers developed novel methods to model vessel dilatation. A compromised BBB in these disease states can be detrimental and result in the dysregulation of the BBB leading to untoward and pathological consequences impacting brain function. We were able to modify an existing technique that enabled us to inject directly into the Cisterna magna (CM) to induce dilatation of blood vessels using elastase, and disrupt the tight junctions (TJ) of the BBB. With this method, we were able to see various metrics of success over previous techniques, including consistent blood vessel dilatation, reduced mortality or improved recovery, and improving the fill/opacifying agent, a silicone rubber compound, delivery for labeling blood vessels for dilatation analysis. This modified minimally invasive method has had promising results, with a 19%-32% increase in sustained dilatation of large blood vessels in mice from 2 weeks to 3 months post-injection. This improvement contrasts with previous studies, which showed increased dilatation only at the 2 week mark. Additional data suggests sustained expansion even after 9.5 months. This increase was confirmed by comparing the diameter of blood vessels of the elastase and the vehicle-injected group. Overall, this technique is valuable for studying pathological disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) using animal models.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Disease Models, Animal", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Cisterna Magna", "Male", "Dementia, Vascular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dominic", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Brain Health Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto; Dominic.Simpson@camh.ca."}, {"First Name": "Christopher D", "Last Name": "Morrone", "Affiliation": "Brain Health Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health."}, {"First Name": "Darcy", "Last Name": "Wear", "Affiliation": "Brain Health Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Wai Haung", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38811657", "Title": "Cerebrovascular disease emerges with age and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.", "Abstract": "Adults with Down syndrome have a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evidence of cerebrovascular disease across the AD continuum, despite few systemic vascular risk factors. The onset and progression of AD in Down syndrome is highly age-dependent, but it is unknown at what age cerebrovascular disease emerges and what factors influence its severity. In the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study (ABC-DS; n\u2009=\u2009242; age\u2009=\u200925-72), we estimated the age inflection point at which MRI-based white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), microbleeds, and infarcts emerge in relation to demographic data, risk factors, amyloid and tau, and AD diagnosis. Enlarged PVS and infarcts appear to develop in the early 30s, while microbleeds, WMH, amyloid, and tau emerge in the mid to late 30s. Age-residualized WMH were higher in women, in individuals with dementia, and with lower body mass index. Participants with hypertension and APOE-\u03b54 had higher age-residualized PVS and microbleeds, respectively.

Among people with stroke, those of East Asia descent and non-White populations in the United States have a higher burden of ICAD-related stroke compared with Whites of European descent. Disparities in the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAD are less marked than with symptomatic ICAD. In addition to stroke, ICAD increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline, magnifying ICAD societal burden. The risk of stroke recurrence among patients with ICAD-related stroke is the highest among those with confirmed stroke and stenosis \u226570%. In fact, the 1-year recurrent stroke rate of >20% among those with stenosis >70% is one of the highest rates among common causes of stroke. The mechanisms by which ICAD causes stroke include plaque rupture with in situ thrombosis and occlusion or artery-to-artery embolization, hemodynamic injury, and branch occlusive disease. The risk of stroke recurrence varies by the presumed underlying mechanism of stroke, but whether techniques such as quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance perfusion, or transcranial Doppler can help with risk stratification beyond the degree of stenosis is less clear. The diagnosis of ICAD is heavily reliant on lumen-based studies, such as computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography, but newer technologies, such as high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging, can help distinguish ICAD from stenosing arteriopathies.", "Keywords": ["arteries", "cerebral infarction", "demography", "intracranial arteriosclerosis", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Constriction, Pathologic", "Stroke", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Cerebral Infarction", "Angiography, Digital Subtraction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li Hui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY (L.H.C., A.S.-A., J.G.)."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Spagnolo-Allende", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY (L.H.C., A.S.-A., J.G.)."}, {"First Name": "Dixon", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Rush University, Chicago, IL (D.Y.)."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (Y.Q.)."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY (L.H.C., A.S.-A., J.G.)."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "38165319", "Title": "Relationships of Hematocrit With Chronic Covert and Acute Symptomatic Lacunar Ischemic Lesions.", "Abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) concentrations are known to associate with ischemic stroke.

Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6\u00b17.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness.

We performed confounder-adjusted linear regression analyses between neuroimaging scores and both continuous serologies and categorical seropositivity of each pathogen, as well as a combined infectious burden index (IBI). We identified that increased serologic titers of herpes simplex virus 2 were associated with reduced whole-brain cortical thickness, and a combined score of HSV-2 and C. pneumoniae displayed an additive effect on reduced cortical thickness.

While the underlying pathology of SVD remains unclear, chronic hypertension and neuroinflammation are recognized as important risk factors for SVD and for the conversion of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to WMH. Unfortunately, most studies investigating the role of neuroinflammation in WMH relied on peripheral blood markers, e.g., markers for systemic or vascular inflammation, as a proxy for inflammation in the brain itself. However, it is unknown whether such markers accurately capture inflammatory changes within the cerebral white matter. Therefore, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the impact of hypertension on perivascular- and neuroinflammation in both WMH and NAWM. We conducted high field brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by (immuno-)histopathological staining of neuroinflammatory markers on human post-mortem brains of elderly people with a history of hypertension (n\u2009=\u200917) and age-matched normotensive individuals (n\u2009=\u20095). MRI images were co-registered to (immuno-)histopathological data including stainings for microglia and astroglia to assess changes in MRI-based WMH at microscopic resolution. Perivascular inflammation was carefully assessed based on the severity of perivascular astrogliosis of the smallest vessels throughout white matter regions. Hypertension was associated with a larger inflammatory response in both WMH and NAWM. Notably, the presence of close-range perivascular inflammation was twice as common among those with hypertension than in controls both in WMH and NAWM, suggesting that neurovascular inflammation is critical in the etiology of WMH. Moreover, a higher degree of microglial activation was related to a higher burden of WMH. Our results indicate that neuro(vascular)inflammation at the level of the brain itself is involved in the etiology of WMH. Future therapeutic strategies focusing on multitarget interventions including antihypertensive treatment as well as neuroinflammation may ameliorate WMH progression.", "Keywords": ["Hypertension", "Inflammation", "Normal-appearing white matter", "Post-mortem MRI", "Small vessel disease", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "White Matter", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Brain", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Hypertension", "Inflammation", "Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gemma", "Last Name": "Sol\u00e9-Guardia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Custers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "de Lange", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Elyne", "Last Name": "Clijncke", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bram", "Last Name": "Geenen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benno", "Last Name": "K\u00fcsters", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jurgen A H R", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatrics, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Frank-Erik", "Last Name": "de Leeuw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Wiesmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Amanda J", "Last Name": "Kiliaan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imaging, Anatomy, Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Center for Medical Neuroscience, Preclinical Imaging Center PRIME, Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Models tested the effect of OSA on MRI-derived cerebrovascular biomarkers and PET-derived amyloid burden, and the moderating effect of OSA and AD diagnosis on biomarkers. OSA was reported in 39% of participants, which did not differ by clinical AD diagnostic group. OSA was not associated with cerebrovascular biomarkers but was associated with greater cortical amyloid burden. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume (primarily in the parietal lobe), enlarged perivascular spaces, and cortical and striatal amyloid burden were greater across clinical AD diagnostic groups (CS<MCI-DS<possible AD<definite AD). OSA increased the differences in WMH volumes across clinical AD diagnostic groups, primarily in the frontal and temporal lobes. Adults with DS and OSA had greater amyloid burden and greater cerebrovascular disease with AD. Importantly, OSA may be a modifiable risk factor that can be targeted for intervention in this population at risk for AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cerebrovascular disease", "Down syndrome", "Obstructive sleep apnea"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Gertrude.

The cause of increased dementia-related cerebrovascular disease in DS is unknown. We explored whether protein markers of neuroinflammation are associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease among adults with DS. Participants from the Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome (ADDS) study with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood biomarker data were included. Support vector machine (SVM) analyses examined the relationship of blood-based proteomic biomarkers with MRI-defined cerebrovascular disease among participants characterized as having cognitive decline (n\u00a0=\u00a036, mean age \u00b1 SD\u00a0=\u00a053\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2) and as being cognitively stable (n\u00a0=\u00a078, mean age\u00a0=\u00a049\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4). Inflammatory and AD markers were associated with cerebrovascular disease, particularly among symptomatic individuals.\u00a0The pattern suggested relatively greater inflammatory involvement among cognitively stable individuals and greater AD involvement among those with cognitively decline. The findings help to generate hypotheses that both inflammatory and AD markers are implicated in cerebrovascular disease among those with DS and point to potential mechanistic pathways for further examination.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Down Syndrome", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Biomarkers"], "Authors":

atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is one of the most frequent causes of stroke worldwide and confers one of the greatest risks of recurrent stroke compared with other causes of stroke. Asymptomatic ICAS is increasingly recognised as a risk factor for silent brain infarctions and dementia, magnifying the global burden of ICAS. Although ICAS is a lumen-based diagnosis, newer diagnostic imaging techniques, such as high-resolution MRI, might help to identify high-risk population subgroups to test interventions that might reduce the risk of stroke recurrence. Secondary stroke prevention in patients with ICAS currently consists of intensive management of modifiable risk factors and dual antiplatelet therapy, which is subsequently reduced to aspirin alone. Despite these therapies, the risk of recurrent stroke in patients presenting with stroke related to 70-99% ICAS exceeds 20% at 1 year; as such, better therapies are urgently needed. The optimal duration and combination of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ICAS is uncertain and is being investigated in addition to low-dose anticoagulation and aspirin. Other ongoing or planned studies will provide high-quality observational data on the role of transluminal angioplasty and stenting, submaximal balloon angioplasty alone, direct or indirect arterial bypass, and ischaemic conditioning for prevention of stroke in patients with ICAS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aspirin", "Constriction, Pathologic", "Humans", "Intracranial Arteriosclerosis", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

We sought to explore the contribution of the modifiable and not-modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) to vulnerable plaque morphology measured by the low GSM index. A total of 1,030 stroke-free community dwelling individuals with carotid plaques present (mean age, 71.8 \u00b1 9.1; 58% women; 56% Hispanic, 20% Non-Hispanic Black, 22% Non-Hispanic White) were assessed for minimum GSM (min GSM) using high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between RFs and minGSM after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Within an individual, median plaque number was 2 (IQR: 1-3) and mean plaque number 2.3 (SD: 1.4). Mean minGSM was 78.4 \u00b1 28.7 (IQR: 56-96), 76.3 \u00b1 28.8 in men and 80 \u00b1 28.5 in women; 78.7 \u00b1 29.3 in Hispanics participants, 78.5 \u00b1 27.2 in Non-Hispanic Black participants, and 78.2 \u00b1 29 in Non-Hispanic white participants. In multivariable adjusted model, male sex (\u03b2 = -5.78, p = 0.007), obesity BMI (\u03b2 = -6.92, p = 0.01), and greater levels of fasting glucose (\u03b2 = -8.02, p = 0.02) and LDL dyslipidemia (\u03b2 = -6.64, p = 0.005) were positively associated with lower minGSM, while presence of glucose lowering medication resulted in a significant inverse association (\u03b2 = 7.68, p = 0.04). Interaction (with p for interaction <0.1) and stratification analyses showed that effect of age on minGSM was stronger in men (\u03b2 = -0.44, p = 0.03) than in women (\u03b2 = -0.20, p = 0.18), and in individuals not taking glucose lowering medication (\u03b2 = -0.33, p = 0.009). Our study has demonstrated an important contribution of glycemic and lipid metabolism to vulnerable, low density or echolucent plaque morphology, especially among men and suggested that use of glucose lowering medication was associated with more fibrose-stable plaque phenotype (greater GSM).

Brain arterial remodeling stands out as a novel investigational target to understand the role of HIV in cerebrovascular and neurocognitive outcomes. We therefore conducted a review of publications in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library, from inception to April 2021. We included search terms such as HIV, cART, brain, neuroimmunity, arterial remodeling, cerebrovascular disease, and neurocognitive disorders. The literature shows that, in the post-cART era, PLWH continue to experience an increased risk of stroke and neurocognitive disorders (albeit milder forms) compared to uninfected populations. PLWH who are immunosuppressed have a higher proportion of hemorrhagic strokes and strokes caused by opportunistic infection and HIV vasculopathy, while PLWH on long-term cART have higher rates of ischemic strokes, compared to HIV-seronegative controls. Brain large artery atherosclerosis in PLWH is associated with lower CD4 nadir and higher CD4 count during the stroke event. HIV vasculopathy, a form of non-atherosclerotic outward remodeling, on the other hand, is associated with protracted immunosuppression. HIV vasculopathy was also linked to a thinner media layer and increased adventitial macrophages, suggestive of non-atherosclerotic degeneration of the brain arterial wall in the setting of chronic central nervous system inflammation. Cerebrovascular architecture seems to be differentially affected by HIV infection in successfully treated versus immunosuppressed PLWH. Brain large artery atherosclerosis is prevalent even with long-term immune reconstitution post-cART. HIV-associated changes in brain arterial walls may also relate to higher rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, although milder forms are more prevalent in the post-cART era. The underlying mechanisms of HIV-associated pathological arterial remodeling remain poorly understood, but a role has been proposed for chronic HIV-associated inflammation with increased burden on the vasculature. Neuroimaging may come to play a role in assessing brain arterial remodeling and stratifying cerebrovascular risk, but the data remains inconclusive. An improved understanding of the different phenotypes of brain arterial remodeling associated with HIV may reveal opportunities to reduce rates of cerebrovascular disease in the aging population of PLWH on cART.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment", "arterial remodeling", "brain", "cerebrovascular disease"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Spagnolo-Allende", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34132845", "Title": "Systemic Arterial Correlates of Cervical Carotid Artery Tortuosity : The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "The association between cervical internal carotid artery (cICA) tortuosity and atherosclerosis is a\u00a0matter of debate.

The prevalence of cCA DE has been reported 13-31% in population-based and 14-58% in hospital-based studies. The exact mechanisms of this aberrant arterial remodeling are unknown. Although atherosclerosis has often been implicated, the evidence has conflicting results that would support atherosclerosis as the underlying pathology. Actually, other nonatherosclerotic mechanisms related to connective tissue remodeling may play a role. Such mechanism is supported by epidemiological evidence that cCA DE is associated with carotid dissections. Similarly, cCA DE has been associated with vascular risk factors, but inconsistently. Fewer studies have evaluated the risk of vascular events in people with cCA DE. Cross-sectionally, cCA DE is associated with cerebrovascular disease, including white matter hyperintensities, lacunar stroke, and stroke overall. The often-conflicting results may in part be due to the heterogeneity of the population studies and variable definitions used. Preferential use of objective measure of cCA DE, such as carotid length, is advisable, and may help comparing result among different studies. Prospectively, people with cCA DE have a higher risk of vascular events, although it is uncertain if the risk of stroke is also higher in this population. In the absence of alternative stroke etiologies, stroke patients with cCA DE should be considered to have had a cryptogenic stroke and treated with daily antiplatelet therapy.

Methods- We used brain magnetic resonance imaging from 1290 stroke-free participants in the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) to evaluate for CBI. We classified CBI as cardioembolic (ie, known atrial fibrillation), large artery atherosclerosis (extracranial and intracranial), penetrating artery disease, and cryptogenic (no apparent cause). CBI localized in the nonmotor areas of the right hemisphere were considered noneloquent. We then evaluated risk of events by CBI subtype with adjusted Cox proportional models. Results- At the time of magnetic resonance imaging, 236 participants (18%) had CBI (144 [61%] distal cryptogenic, 29 [12%] distal cardioembolic, 26 [11%] large artery atherosclerosis, and 37 [16%] penetrating artery disease). Smaller (per mm, odds ratio, 0.8 [0.8-0.9]) and nonbrain stem infarcts (odds ratio, 0.2 [0.1-0.6]) were more likely to be covert. During the follow-up period (10.4\u00b13.1 years), 398 (31%) died (162 [13%] of vascular death) and 117 (9%) had a stroke (99 [85%]) were ischemic. Risks of events varied by CBI subtype, with the highest risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 2.2 [1.3-3.7]) and vascular death (hazard ratio, 2.24 [1.29-3.88]) noted in participants with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis-related CBI. Conclusions- CBI can be classified into subtypes that have differential outcomes. Certain CBI subtypes such as those related to intracranial large artery atherosclerosis have a high risk of adverse vascular outcomes and could warrant consideration of treatment trials.", "Keywords": ["atherosclerosis", "atrial fibrillation", "brain infarction", "magnetic resonance imaging", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Brain Infarction", "Brain Ischemia", "Cerebral Infarction", "Female", "Humans", "Infarction", "Intracranial Arteriosclerosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (J.G., S.R., J.D., M.S.V.E.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Gil-Guevara", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Texas, Galveston (A.G.-G.)."}, {"First Name": "Srinath", "Last Name": "Ramaswamy", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (J.G., S.R., J.D., M.S.V.E.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "DeRosa", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (J.G., S.R., J.D., M.S.V.E.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marco R", "Last Name": "Di Tullio", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology (M.R.D.T.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics (K.C.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology (T.R., R.L.S.), University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, FL."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology (T.R., R.L.S.), University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, FL."}, {"First Name": "Clinton B", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (C.B.W.)."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (J.G., S.R., J.D., M.S.V.E.), Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2020Jan"}, {"PMID": "31732172", "Title": "Response to letter to the editor by Kawada on \"Association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with advanced fibrosis and stroke\".", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Advanced fibrosis", "Cardiovascular disease", "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease", "Stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neal S", "Last Name": "Parikh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States of America.

It is unknown whether the stiffness of intermediary arteries connecting the aorta and brain modifies this association. Participants from the Northern Manhattan Study were assessed for SPVS (defined as \u22643\u2009mm T1 voids) and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) using MRI. Middle (MCA) and anterior cerebral arterial (ACA) diameters (measured on time-of-flight MRA) and CCA strain (assessed by ultrasound) were used as surrogates of stiffness. Brachial and aortic pulse pressure (PP) and aortic augmentation index (Aix, assessed by applanation tonometry) were used as markers of pulsatility. We tested whether stiffness in intermediary arteries modifies the association between extracranial pulsatility with SPVS and WMH. We found that among 941 participants (mean age 71\u2009\u00b1\u20099 years, 60% women, 66% Hispanic), the right MCA/ACA diameter was associated with right anterior SPVS (B\u2009=\u20090.177, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Brachial PP was associated with right anterior SPVS (B\u2009=\u20090.003, P\u2009=\u20090.02), and the effect size was bigger with right MCA/ACA diameter in the upper tertile (P\u2009=\u20090.001 for the interaction). The association between right CCA strain and ipsilateral SPVS was modified by MCA/ACA diameter, with the largest effect size in those with ipsilateral MCA/ACA diameter in the upper tertile (P\u2009=\u20090.001 for the interaction). Similar dose-effects and statistical interactions were replicated using aortic AIx or aortic PP. We found no evidence of effect modification between pulsatile measures and WMH by stiffness measures.

The causes of this health disparity remain elusive, partially because of the relative limited capacity for biomedical research in the developing countries that comprise Caribbean Latin America. To begin to address this issue, we were awarded a Development Research Award from the US NIH and Fogarty International Center in order to establish the local capacity to integrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic, establish collaborations with Dominican investigators, and conduct a pilot study on the role of cerebrovascular markers in the clinical expression of AD. Ninety older adult participants with and without AD dementia and with and without a strong family history of AD dementia received MRI scans and clinical evaluation. We quantified markers of cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], presence of infarct, and presence of microbleed) and neurodegeneration (entorhinal cortex volume) and compared them across groups. Patients with AD dementia had smaller entorhinal cortex and greater WMH volumes compared with controls, regardless of family history status. This study provides evidence for the capacity to conduct MRI studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that small vessel cerebrovascular disease represents a core feature of AD dementia, as affected participants had elevated WMH volumes irrespective of family history status.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "developing countries", "neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Dominican Republic", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Pilot Projects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angel", "Last Name": "Piriz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa A", "Last Name": "Guzman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fawad", "Last Name": "Viqar", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irene B", "Last Name": "Meier", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Mena", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Dashnaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Campos", "Affiliation": "Centro de Radiologia Especializada, Santiago, Dominican Republic."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Medrano", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Mother and Teacher Pontifical Catholic University, Santiago, Dominican Republic."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Lantigua", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30399527", "Title": "Pathological correlates of brain arterial calcifications.", "Abstract": "In clinical practice, calcifications seen on computed tomographic studies within the large brain arteries are often referred to as a surrogate marker for cholesterol-mediated atherosclerosis.

The role of HIV-related immunosuppression in stroke mechanism is uncertain. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that stroke mechanisms among HIV+ individuals vary according to preceding CD4 counts. We carried out a retrospective chart review of inpatient admissions for ICD-9 defined ischemic events (TIA or stroke) in HIV+ individuals from 2002 to 2016 at a tertiary care center. Stroke mechanisms were ascertained based on radiographic and clinical presentation, and adjudicated by the treating team and confirmed separately by a vascular neurologist. Vascular risk factors, use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), nadir CD4 and current CD4 counts (cells/mm3) were captured to build logistic regressions and generalized linear models to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and beta estimates with their respective 95% confidence intervals. We found that among 115 cases (median age 52, 64% men), stroke mechanisms were 22% due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 17% small artery disease, 16% infectious, 8% cardioembolic, 21% cryptogenic, and 16% other etiologies. The median nadir CD4-count was 153 (IQR 22-274), and 312 (IQR 88-518) at the time of stroke, and 53% were on ARVs. LAA was more common with longer HIV infection (OR 1.1 per year, 1.0-1.2) and nadir CD4 counts <200 (OR 6.7, 1.4-31.9). Stroke due to LAA was associated with higher CD4 count the year prior to stroke (B\u2009=\u20090.009, P\u2009=\u20090.06 for the interaction) independent of CD4 nadir <200 (B\u2009=\u20091.88, P\u2009=\u20090.035). We concluded that in this sample, LAA was the most frequent stroke mechanism among HIV+ individuals with nadir CD4\u2009<\u2009200 but higher CD4 counts near the time of stroke.

Results- The cohort included 107 participants (mean age, 66.5\u00b110.3; 67% men). In an adjusted linear regression model, lower GLA activity was associated with larger brain arterial diameters (B=0.50\u00b10.23, P=0.03).

"Brain Large Artery Lymphocytic Inflammation and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Related Brain Arterial Remodeling.", "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of increased stroke risk in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains unclear. Our study investigated the relationship between adventitial and intimal CD3+ T cells and brain arterial remodeling that potentially contributes to HIV-related vasculopathy and stroke. Large brain arteries from 84 HIV+ cases and 78 HIV- cases were analyzed to determine interadventitial and luminal diameters, intimal and wall thickness, percent stenosis, and the presence of atherosclerosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect and visually score CD3, a pan-T-cell marker, in the intima and adventitia. Our study showed that numbers of adventitial CD3+ T cells are lower among persons with HIV than among those without HIV, especially if CD4 counts are <200, though intimal CD3+ T cell numbers did not differ by HIV status. Among those with HIV but CD4 counts of <200 at the time of death, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic outward remodeling, while among those with HIV and CD4 of >200 or HIV- controls, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic inward remodeling. We conclude that intimal lymphocytic inflammation is involved in brain arterial remodeling that may contribute to HIV-related cerebrovascular pathology.IMPORTANCE Although mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has decreased with the use of combination antiretroviral therapies, there is now an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease associated with HIV. Thus, there is a need to understand the pathogenesis of stroke in HIV infection. Our study examines how lymphocytic inflammation in brain arteries may contribute to increased cerebral vasculopathy. With this understanding, our study can potentially help direct future therapies to target and prevent brain arterial remodeling processes associated with HIV.", "Keywords": ["T lymphocytes", "brain arterial remodeling", "human immunodeficiency virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "CD3 Complex", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Arteries", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "T-Lymphocytes", "Vascular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adele", "Last Name": "Shenoy", "Affiliation": "New York Medical College, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology and Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Randolph", "Last Name": "Marshall", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Morgello", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York jg3233@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2018Jun15"}, {"PMID": "29374104", "Title": "Functional Trajectories, Cognition, and Subclinical Cerebrovascular Disease.", "Abstract": "Cognition and education influence functional trajectories, but whether associations differ with subclinical brain infarcts (SBI) or white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) is unknown.

In a sample of 110 autopsied individuals (69% men, 76% HIV+, mean age 51), we used multilevel models to relate large artery lumen and lumen-to-wall ratio to left frontal lobe arteriolar lumen and lumen-to-wall ratio adjusting for demographics and vascular risk factors. Comparing the large artery characteristics of the whole brain did not disclose significant associations with frontal lobe arteriolar characteristics. However, restricting the comparison to large arteries upstream of the studied arterioles demonstrated an independent association between left-sided frontal lobe arteriolar luminal diameter with large artery luminal diameters (B\u2009=\u20091.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.77, P\u2009=\u20090.01) and with large artery lumen-to-wall ratio (B\u2009=\u20090.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29, P\u2009=\u20090.05). In stratified models, the point estimates in the HIV+ subsample were larger than in the HIV- subsample. These finding suggest coupling between higher proximal blood flow represented by large artery diameter and lower distal resistance represented by arteriolar dilatation. The relationship between arteriolar dilatation and brain parenchyma homeostasis should be further studied.", "Keywords": ["Arterial", "Cerebral hemodynamics", "Cerebrovascular", "Dolichoectasia", "HIV", "Remodeling", "Vascular pathology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arterioles", "Autopsy", "Carotid Arteries", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Arteries", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "HIV Infections", "Histocytochemistry", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Vascular Resistance", "Vasodilation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 710 W 168th Street, 6th floor, Suite 639, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jg3233@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jacinta", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina", "Last Name": "Chon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Morgello", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurovirology", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29166955", "Title": "Brain Arterial Diameters and Cognitive Performance: The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis that brain arterial diameters are associated with cognitive performance, particularly in arteries supplying domain-specific territories.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Arterial dilatation", "Cognition", "Dolichoectasia", "Vascular dementia", "Vascular remodeling"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anterior Cerebral Artery", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Executive Function", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Cerebral Artery", "Posterior Cerebral Artery", "Reaction Time"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurology,College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Erin", "Last Name": "Kulick", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurology,College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Yeseon", "Last Name": "Park Moon", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurology,College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Chuanhui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurology,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Miami,Florida."}, {"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "5Division of Biostatistics,Mailman School of Public Health,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Bagci", "Last Name": "Ahmet", "Affiliation": "6Department of Radiology,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Miami,Florida."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurology,College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Noam", "Last Name": "Alperin", "Affiliation": "6Department of Radiology,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Miami,Florida."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurology,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Miami,Florida."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurology,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Miami,Florida."}, {"First Name": "Clinton B", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "8National Institutes of Health,Bethesda,Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurology,College of Physicians and Surgeons,Columbia University,New York,New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "28847914", "Title": "Subclinical Cerebrovascular Disease Increases the Risk of Incident Stroke and Mortality: The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "The effects of white matter hyperintensity volume and subclinical brain infarcts on the risk of incident stroke, its ischemic subtypes, and mortality require further study in diverse samples.", "Keywords": ["cerebrovascular disease/stroke", "epidemiology", "mortality", "stroke", "white matter disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Asymptomatic Diseases", "Brain Infarction", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Leukoencephalopathies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Clinton B", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Evelyn F.

One out of four strokes is recurrent. Secondary stroke prevention starts with deciphering the most likely stroke mechanism. In general, one of the main goals in stroke reduction is to control vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking cessation. Changes in lifestyle like a healthy diet and aerobic exercise are also recommended strategies. In the case of cardioembolism due to atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or cardiac thrombus, anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy. The role of anticoagulation is less evident in the case of bioprosthetic valves, patent foramen ovale, and dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction. Strokes due to larger artery atherosclerosis account for approximately a third of all strokes. In the case of symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, surgical intervention as close as possible in time to the index event seems highly beneficial. In the case of intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, the best medical therapy consists of antiplatelets, high-dose statins, aggressive controls of vascular risk factors, and lifestyle modifications, with no role for intracranial arterial stenting or angioplasty. For patients with small artery occlusion (ie, lacunar stroke), the therapy is similar to that used in patients with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis.

As the arteries supplying blood to the brain develop during embryogenesis, variation in their anatomy may occur and this variation may influence the development of arterial disease. Angiogenesis, which occurs mainly by sprouting of parent arteries, is the first stage at which variations can occur. At day 24 of embryological life, the internal carotid artery is the first artery to form and it provides all the blood required by the primitive brain. As the occipital region, brain stem and cerebellum enlarge; the internal carotid supply becomes insufficient, triggering the development of the posterior circulation. At this stage, the posterior circulation consists of a primitive mesh of arterial networks that originate from projection of penetrators from the distal carotid artery and more proximally from carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomoses. These anastomoses regress when the basilar artery and the vertebral arteries become independent from the internal carotid artery, but their persistence is not uncommon in adults (e.g., persistent trigeminal artery). Other common remnants of embryological development include fenestration or duplication (most commonly of the basilar artery), hypoplasia (typically of the posterior communicating artery) or agenesis (typically of the anterior communicating artery). Learning more about the hemodynamic consequence that these variants may have on the brain territories they supply may help understand better the underlying physiopathology of cerebral arterial

VZV antigen was detected in 24 (44%) cerebral arteries from 14 (78%) subjects.", "Keywords": ["Cerebral artery", "Diabetes", "Drug abuse", "HIV", "Subclinical reactivation", "VZV"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cerebral Arteries", "Female", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Risk Factors", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Virus Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria A", "Last Name": "Nagel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelly", "Last Name": "Khmeleva", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Choe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Don", "Last Name": "Gilden", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA; Department of Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.

We aim to evaluate if the prevalence of vascular risk factors accounts for differences observed in stroke subtypes by race/ethnicity. Patients with acute stroke were prospectively enrolled in the Miami Stroke Registry. Patients' demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics were systematically collected. Stroke subtypes were ascertained using TOAST criteria. The sample was divided into Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Hispanics, African Americans (AA), and Non-Hispanic Black Caribbean (NHBC). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess differences among groups. Among 473 stroke patients (mean age 64 \u00b1 14 years; 63.7% were men) of which 52.9% were Hispanic, 22.6% were AA, 13.5% NHBC and 11.0% were NHW. Large artery atherosclerosis was more prevalent in NHBC (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.02-2.97) than in the other groups. Adjusting for covariates rendered the association not significant (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.93-3.16). Cardioembolism was more frequent in Hispanics (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.28-2.96) and NHW (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.42-4.96) as compared to NHBC and AA combined. Adjusting for covariates, the association was no longer significant for Hispanics but was further strengthened for NHW (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.42-6.42). Our results suggest that the vascular risk factors prevalence among different racial and ethnic groups partially explains disparities found in the prevalence of some stroke subtypes.

We investigated whether there is a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors in the adult US population with HIV compared to uninfected controls that could explain some of the increased vascular events. We obtained prevalence estimates of vascular risk factors, stratified by the HIV status, in sampled adults aged 20-49 years from the 1999 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Estimates were weighted to account for oversampling and nonresponse. Logistic regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic status were created to adjust for confounders. The analysis included 12,339 US adults, 76 with HIV infection. The weighted seroprevalence of HIV was 0.48% (95% CI 0.33-0.65). In univariate analysis, HIV infection was more prevalent in non-Hispanic blacks (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% CI 3.6-15.2), men (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.42-4.89), the physically inactive (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.0), and current smokers (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4). Increased waist circumference (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0) was less common in HIV-infected individuals, although controlling for sex and ethnicity differences, this difference became nonsignificant (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.2). Further controlling for differences in income and education rendered the associations with smoking and physical inactivity nonsignificant, but revealed associations of HIV infection with hypertension (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-6.0) and diabetes (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-16.1).

We hypothesize that dilatation would be present in arterial walls of patients with HIV compared to controls. Fifty-one intracranial arteries, obtained from autopsies of five individuals with HIV infection and 13 without, were fixed, embedded, stained, and digitally photographed. Cross-sectional areas of intima, media, adventitia and lumen were measured by preset color thresholding. A measure of arterial remodeling was obtained by calculating the ratio between the lumen diameter and the thickness of the arterial wall. Higher numbers indicate arterial dilatation, while lower numbers indicate arterial narrowing. HIV-infected brain donors were more frequently black (80% vs. 15%, P\u2009=\u20090.02) compared with uninfected donors. Inter and intra-reader agreement measures were excellent. The continuous measure of vascular remodeling was significantly higher in the arteries from HIV donors (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.8, P\u2009=\u20090.02). Adjustments for demographics and clinical covariates strengthen this association (\u03b2\u2009=\u20099.3, P\u2009=\u20090.01).
