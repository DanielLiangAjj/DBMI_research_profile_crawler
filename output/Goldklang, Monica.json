We developed a virus neutralization platform strategy that relies only on bioinformatic and genetic information of the virus of interest. The platform uses viral envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to set up an assay that mimics multicycle infection but is safe and, therefore, amenable to biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions for viruses that require BSL3 facilities (e.g., SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2).

In the present report, we have identified a potentially novel therapeutic agent through the use of a high throughput screen based on the knowledge that cigarette smoke induces the proteolytic enzyme MMP1 leading to destruction of the lung in COPD. A construct utilizing the cigarette responsive promoter element of MMP-1 was conjugated to a luciferase reporter and utilized in an in vitro assay to screen the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify putative targets that suppressed luciferase expression in response to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors potently inhibited luciferase expression and were further validated. SSRI treatment suppressed MMP-1 production in small airway epithelial cells exposed to (CSE) in vitro as well as in smoke exposed rabbits. In addition, SSRI treatment inhibited inflammatory cytokine production while rescuing cigarette smoke induced downregulation in vivo of the anti-inflammatory lipid transporter ABCA1, previously shown by our laboratory to be lung protective. Importantly, SSRI treatment prevented lung destruction in smoke exposed rabbits as measured by morphometry.

Mutations in the Serpina1 gene cause AAT to form hepatoxic polymers, which can lead to reduced availability for the protein's primary function and severe liver disease. An AAT antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was previously identified to be beneficial for the AATD liver disease by blocking the mutated AAT transcripts. Here we hypothesized that knockdown of AAT aggravates murine lung injury during smoke exposure and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 4 groups each for the smoking and smoke-flu injury models. The ASO and control (No-ASO) were injected subcutaneously starting with smoking or four days prior to influenza infection and then injected weekly at 50 mg/kg body weight. ASO treatment during a 3-month smoke exposure significantly decreased the serum and lung AAT expression, resulting in increased Cela1 expression and elastase activity. However, despite the decrease in AAT, neither the inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) nor the lung structural changes were significantly worsened by ASO treatment. We observed significant differences in inflammation and emphysema due to smoke exposure, but did not observe an ASO treatment effect. Similarly, with the smoke-flu model, differences were only observed between smoke-flu and room air controls, but not as a result of ASO treatment. Off-target effects or compensatory mechanisms may account for this finding. Alternatively, the reduction of AAT with ASO treatment, while sufficient to protect from liver injury, may not be robust enough to lead to lung injury. The results also suggest that previously described AAT ASO treatment for AAT mutation related liver disease may attenuate hepatic injury without being detrimental to the lungs. These potential mechanisms need to be further investigated in order to fully understand the impact of AAT inhibition on protease-antiprotease imbalance in the murine smoke exposure model.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Humans", "Injections, Subcutaneous", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Random Allocation", "Smoke Inhalation Injury", "alpha 1-Antitrypsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyle", "Last Name": "Stearns", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Goldklang", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tina", "Last Name": "Zelonina", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Blomenkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University.

Neutrophilic infiltration and increased pulmonary vascular permeability are hallmarks of early ARDS and precipitate a self-perpetuating cascade of inflammatory signaling. The biochemical processes initiating these events remain unclear. Typically associated with extracellular matrix degradation, recent data suggest matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are regulators of pulmonary inflammation. To demonstrate that inhalation of a broad MMP inhibitor attenuates LPS induced pulmonary inflammation. Nebulized CGS27023AM (CGS) was administered to LPS-injured mice. Pulmonary CGS levels were examined by mass spectroscopy. Inflammatory scoring of hematoxylin-eosin sections, examination of vascular integrity via lung wet/dry and bronchoalveolar lvage/serum FITC-albumin ratios were performed. Cleaved caspase-3 levels were also assessed. Differential cell counts and pulse-chase labeling were utilized to determine the effects of CGS on neutrophil migration. The effects of CGS on human neutrophil migration and viability were examined using Boyden chambers and MTT assays. Nebulization successfully delivered CGS to the lungs. Treatment decreased pulmonary inflammatory scores, edema, and apoptosis in LPS treated animals.

We utilized a previously published mouse model of ARDS, intranasal delivery of LPS, to induce the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability seen in lung disease. We intravenously injected mice with Cy7 or 68-Gallium (68Ga) labeled mouse albumin and imaged using optical imaging (OI)/CT and PET. We observed significantly increased lung levels of Cy7-albumin on 3D OI/CT, which matched the abnormal appearance on microCT. This uptake correlated with fluorescence seen on sectioned lungs. To examine the translational potential of these findings, we radiolabeled albumin with 68Ga. We found that in mice with LPS-induced lung injury, 68Ga-albumin PET correlated with our optical imaging findings and demonstrated abnormal activity in the lung fields, indicative of abnormal epithelial permeability. These findings indicate 68Ga-albumin can be utilized as a sensitive translational radiotracer for quantifying the abnormal epithelial permeability that is seen in various lung pathologies, including COVID-19 induced pneumonia and ARDS.

This decreased cholesterol efflux results in lipid-laden macrophages. We hypothesize that cigarette smoke adversely affects cholesterol transport via an ABCA1-dependent mechanism in macrophages, enhancing TLR4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) signaling and resulting in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) up-regulation and exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation. ABCA1 is significantly down-regulated in the lung upon smoke exposure conditions. Macrophages exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo and in vitro exhibit impaired cholesterol efflux correlating with significantly decreased ABCA1 expression, up-regulation of the TLR4/Myd88 pathway, and downstream MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression. Treatment with liver X receptor (LXR) agonist restores ABCA1 expression after short-term smoke exposure and attenuates the inflammatory response; after long-term smoke exposure, there is also attenuated physiologic and morphologic changes of emphysema. In vitro, treatment with LXR agonist decreases macrophage inflammatory activation in wild-type but not ABCA1 knockout mice, suggesting an ABCA1-dependent mechanism of action. These studies demonstrate an important association between cigarette smoke exposure and cholesterol-mediated pathways in the macrophage inflammatory response.

A subset of lung T cells can persist as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) following infection and allergen induction, although the generation and role of TRM in asthma persistence and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of chronic exposure to intranasal house dust mite (HDM) extract to dissect how lung TRMs are generated and function in the persistence and pathogenesis of allergic airway disease. We demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate into the lung tissue during acute HDM exposure; however, only CD4+ TRMs, and not CD8+ TRMs, persist long term following cessation of HDM administration. Lung CD4+ TRMs are localized around airways and are rapidly reactivated upon allergen re-exposure accompanied by the rapid induction of airway hyperresponsiveness independent of circulating T cells. Lung CD4+ TRM activation to HDM challenge is also accompanied by increased recruitment and activation of dendritic cells in the lungs.

Following the standard protocols of fixation, embedding, and sectioning, lung micrographs were: (1) marked with nonparenchymal area, preprocessed, and binarized under the researcher's supervision; (2) analyzed with a statistical learning method, Gaussian mixture model, to provide an unbiased categorization of parenchymal airspace compartments, corresponding to a single alveolus, alveolar sac, and ductal/destructive airspace; and (3) further quantified into morphometric parameters, including reference volume, alveolar count, and ductal/destructive fraction (DF) based on stereological principles. PAP was performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections from mice and rabbits. Unbiased categorization revealed differences in alveolar size among several mouse strains (NZW/LacJ<AKR/J<A/J<C57BL/6J) and across species (mouse<rabbit). Further quantification indicates that parenchymal destruction, modeled in mouse lungs with 1-month smoke exposure, resulted in decreased alveolar count, increased DF, but no significant differences in mean linear intercept. DF also provides a robust measurement that is not biased by processing artifacts, magnification, or reference volume, which are common limitations in human lung biopsies or data obtained from different laboratories.

Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Airway Remodeling", "Animals", "Bronchitis", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Immunohistochemistry", "Immunoprecipitation", "Iron", "Iron Chelating Agents", "Iron Regulatory Protein 2", "Iron, Dietary", "Iron-Binding Proteins", "Lung", "Lung Injury", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Mitochondria", "Mucociliary Clearance", "Pneumonia", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Smoke", "Smoking", "Nicotiana", "Frataxin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Cloonan", "Affiliation": "Joan and Sanford I.

Whereas the role of Wnt family members in regulating T cell maintenance and maturation is established, their contribution to T cell activation in allergic asthma is not known. We hypothesized that Wnt10b plays a role in the modulation of the allergic airway response and affects T cell activation and polarization. Using an in vivo house dust mite asthma model, Wnt10b-deficient (Wnt10b(-/-)) mice were allergen-sensitized and inflammation, as well as T cell activation, was studied in vivo and in vitro. Wnt10b(-/-) mice exhibited an augmented inflammatory phenotype with an increase in eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage and IL-4 and IL-13 in the lungs when compared with wild-type mice. In vitro studies confirmed an increased T helper type 2 polarization and increased T cell activation of Wnt10b(-/-) cells. Accordingly, the percentage of naive T cells was elevated by the addition of recombinant Wnt10b protein. Finally, Wnt10b(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in the percentage of effector T cells in the lungs after house dust mite sensitization, which indicated a heightened activation state, measured by an increased percentage of CD69(hi)CD11a(hi) cells. These findings suggest that Wnt10b plays an important role in regulating asthmatic airway inflammation through modification of the T cell response and is a prospective target in the disease process.", "Keywords": ["T helper type 2", "Wnt pathway", "Wnt10b", "allergy", "asthma"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Cell Polarity", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lung", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Spleen", "T-Lymphocytes", "Wnt Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jordis", "Last Name": "Trischler", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Shiomi", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Damian L", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "3 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Piotr L", "Last Name": "Sklepkiewicz", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Monica P", "Last Name": "Goldklang", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kenji F", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan, and."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan, and."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "3 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine M", "Last Name": "D'Armiento", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "25130446", "Title": "Monitoring and staging abdominal aortic aneurysm disease with pulse wave imaging.", "Abstract": "The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a silent and often deadly vascular disease caused by the localized weakening of the arterial wall. Previous work has indicated that local changes in wall stiffness can be detected with pulse wave imaging (PWI), which is a non-invasive technique for tracking the propagation of pulse waves along the aorta at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of PWI to monitor and stage AAA progression in a murine model of the disease. ApoE/TIMP-1 knockout mice (N = 18) were given angiotensin II for 30 days via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. The suprarenal sections of the abdominal aortas were imaged every 2-3 d after implantation using a 30-MHz VisualSonics Vevo 770 with 15-\u03bcm lateral resolution. Pulse wave propagation was monitored at an effective frame rate of 8 kHz by using retrospective electrocardiogram gating and by performing 1-D cross-correlation on the radiofrequency signals to obtain the displacements induced by the waves. In normal aortas, the pulse waves propagated at constant velocities (2.8 \u00b1 0.9 m/s, r(2) = 0.89 \u00b1 0.11), indicating that the composition of these vessels was relatively homogeneous. In the mice that developed AAAs (N = 10), the wave speeds in the aneurysm sac were 45% lower (1.6 \u00b1 0.6 m/s) and were more variable (r(2) = 0.66 \u00b1 0.23). Moreover, the wave-induced wall displacements were at least 80% lower within the sacs compared with the surrounding vessel. Finally, in mice that developed fissures (N = 5) or ruptures (N = 3) at the sites of their AAA, higher displacements directed out of the lumen and with no discernible wave pattern (r(2) < 0.20) were observed throughout the cardiac cycle. These findings indicate that PWI can be used to distinguish normal murine aortas from aneurysmal, fissured and ruptured ones. Hence, PWI could potentially be used to monitor and stage human aneurysms by providing information complementary to standard B-mode ultrasound.", "Keywords": ["Abdominal aortic aneurysm", "Fissure", "High-frequency imaging", "Mice", "Motion estimation", "Normalized cross-correlation", "Pulse wave velocity", "Regional pulse wave", "Rupture", "Speckle tracking", "Ultrasound imaging"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal", "Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mice", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sacha D", "Last Name": "Nandlall", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monica P", "Last Name": "Goldklang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubrey", "Last Name": "Kalashian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nida A", "Last Name": "Dangra", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine M", "Last Name": "D'Armiento", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa E", "Last Name": "Konofagou", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.
