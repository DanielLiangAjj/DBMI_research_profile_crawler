Electronic health records (EHRs) remain central to analysis of workflow, owing to their wide-ranging impact on clinical processes. The two most common interventions to facilitate EHR-related workflow analysis are automated location tracking using sensor-based technologies and EHR usage data logs. However, to maximize the potential of these technologies, and especially to facilitate workflow redesign, it is necessary to overlay these quantitative findings on the contextual data from qualitative methods such as ethnography. Such a complementary approach promises to yield more precise measures of clinical workflow that provide insights into how redesign could address inefficiencies. In this paper, we categorize clinical workflow in the Emergency Department (ED) into three types (perceived, real and ideal) to create a structured approach to workflow redesign using the available data. We use diverse data sources: sensor-based location tracking through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), summary EHR usage data logs, and data from physician interviews augmented by direct observations (through clinician shadowing). Our goal is to discover inefficiencies and bottlenecks that can be addressed to achieve a more ideal workflow state relative to its real and perceived state. We thereby seek to demonstrate a novel data-driven approach toward iterative workflow redesign that generalizes for use in a variety of settings. We also propose types of targeted support or adjustments to offset some of the inefficiencies we noted.", "Keywords": ["Clinical workflow", "Data analytics", "EHR data logs", "Emergency department", "Quality improvement", "RFID"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akshay", "Last Name": "Vankipuram", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Arizona State University, Scottsdale, AZ, United States.

Typically, some combination of approaches drawn from ethnography and grounded theory-based qualitative methods are used to develop relevant metrics. Medical institutions have recently attempted to introduce technological interventions to develop quantifiable quality metrics to supplement existing purely qualitative analyses. These interventions range from automated location tracking to repositories of clinical data (e.g., electronics health record (EHR) data, medical equipment logs). Our goal in this paper is to present a cohesive framework that combines a set of analytic techniques that can potentially complement traditional human observations to derive a deeper understanding of clinical workflow and thereby to enhance the quality, safety, and efficiency of care offered in that environment. We present a series of theoretically-guided techniques to perform analysis and visualization of data developed using location tracking, with illustrations using the Emergency Department (ED) as an example. Our framework is divided into three modules: (i) transformation, (ii) analysis, and (iii) visualization. We describe the methods used in each of these modules, and provide a series of visualizations developed using location-tracking data collected at the Mayo Clinic ED (Phoenix, AZ). Our innovative analytics go beyond qualitative study, and includes user data collected from a relatively modern but increasingly ubiquitous technique of location tracking, with the goal of creating quantitative workflow metrics.

Using sensor-based technology, the distance between the physician and the computer is calculated by using the single board computers installed in patient rooms that log each time a Bluetooth signal is seen from a device that the physicians carry. This distance is compared automatically with the accepted room radius to determine if the physicians are present in the room at the time logged to provide greater precision. The logged times, accurate to the second, were compared with physicians' handwritten times, showing automatic recordings to be more precise. This real time automatic method will free the physician from extra cognitive load of manually recording data.

This novel approach allows us to characterize the conversational structure, clinical content, disruptions in the conversation, and the inherently phasic nature of nurse handoff communication. The characterization of communication patterns highlights the relationships underlying the verbal content of nurse handoffs with specific emphasis on: the interactive nature of conversation, relevance of role-based (incoming, outgoing) communication requirements, clinical content focus on critical patient-related events, and discussion of pending patient management tasks.

In an effort to support improved and more interoperable data capture regarding Usability Errors, we have created the Usability Error Ontology (UEO) as a classification method for representing knowledge regarding Usability Errors. We expect the UEO will grow over time to support an increasing number of HIT system types. In this manuscript, we present this Ontology of Usability Error Types and specifically address Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Revenue Cycle HIT systems.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Ontologies", "Electronic Health Records", "Internationality", "Medical Errors", "Medical Informatics", "Medical Records Systems, Computerized", "Software", "Terminology as Topic", "User-Computer Interface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Elkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Catherine", "Last Name": "Beuscart-Zephir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sylvia", "Last Name": "Pelayo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vimla", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "N\u00f8hr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Studies in health technology and informatics", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23703824", "Title": "A systematic review of the literature on the evaluation of handoff tools: implications for research and practice.", "Abstract": "Given the complexities of the healthcare environment, efforts to develop standardized handoff practices have led to widely varying manifestations of handoff tools.
