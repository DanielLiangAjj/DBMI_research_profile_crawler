[{"PMID": "36347894", "Title": "A\ufeff curated collection of human vaccination response signatures.", "Abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput experiments and systems biology approaches have resulted in hundreds of publications identifying \"immune signatures\". Unfortunately, these are often described within text, figures, or tables in a format not amenable to computational processing, thus severely hampering our ability to fully exploit this information. Here we present a data model to represent immune signatures, along with the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) Dashboard ( www.hipc-dashboard.org ), a web-enabled application to facilitate signature access and querying. The data model captures the biological response components (e.g., genes, proteins, cell types or metabolites) and metadata describing the context under which the signature was identified using standardized terms from established resources (e.g., HGNC, Protein Ontology, Cell Ontology). We have manually curated a collection of &gt;600 immune signatures from &gt;60 published studies profiling human vaccination responses for the current release. The system will aid in building a broader understanding of the human immune response to stimuli by enabling researchers to easily access and interrogate published immune signatures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Metadata", "Software", "Systems Biology", "Vaccination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenneth C", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel G", "Last Name": "Chawla", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bhavjinder K", "Last Name": "Dhillon", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Zhou", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randi", "Last Name": "Vita", "Affiliation": "Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eva C", "Last Name": "van der Leest", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jing Yi Jessica", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ernest", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Amani", "Last Name": "Abid", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bjoern", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert E W", "Last Name": "Hancock", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Aris", "Last Name": "Floratos", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. af2202@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Steven H", "Last Name": "Kleinstein", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. steven.kleinstein@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific data", "PubDate": "2022Nov08"}, {"PMID": "36266291", "Title": "The Immune Signatures data resource, a compendium of systems vaccinology datasets.", "Abstract": "Vaccines are among the most cost-effective public health interventions for preventing infection-induced morbidity and mortality, yet much remains to be learned regarding the mechanisms by which vaccines protect. Systems immunology combines traditional immunology with modern 'omic profiling techniques and computational modeling to promote rapid and transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. The NIH/NIAID Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) has leveraged systems immunology approaches to identify molecular signatures associated with the immunogenicity of many vaccines. However, comparative analyses have been limited by the distributed nature of some data, potential batch effects across studies, and the absence of multiple relevant studies from non-HIPC groups in ImmPort. To support comparative analyses across different vaccines, we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource is available through ImmuneSpace, along with code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization starting from the underlying study data in ImmPort and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

Despite its high heritability and prevalence, few susceptibility genes for ET have been identified. To identify ET genes, whole-exome sequencing was performed in 37 early-onset ET families with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. We identified candidate genes for follow-up functional studies in five ET families. In two independent families, we identified variants predicted to affect function in the nitric oxide (NO) synthase 3 gene (NOS3) that cosegregated with disease. NOS3 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (including cerebellum), neurons and endothelial cells, and is one of three enzymes that converts l-arginine to the neurotransmitter NO. In one family, a heterozygous variant, c.46G>A (p.(Gly16Ser)), in NOS3, was identified in three affected ET cases and was absent in an unaffected family member; and in a second family, a heterozygous variant, c.164C>T (p.(Pro55Leu)), was identified in three affected ET cases (dizygotic twins and their mother). Both variants result in amino-acid substitutions of highly conserved amino-acid residues that are predicted to be deleterious and damaging by in silico analysis. In three independent families, variants predicted to affect function were also identified in other genes, including KCNS2 (KV9.2), HAPLN4 (BRAL2) and USP46. These genes are highly expressed in the cerebellum and Purkinje cells, and influence function of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic system. This is in concordance with recent evidence that the pathophysiological process in ET involves cerebellar dysfunction and possibly cerebellar degeneration with a reduction in Purkinje cells, and a decrease in GABA-ergic tone.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Endopeptidases", "Essential Tremor", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III", "Pedigree", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinmin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nora", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Kisselev", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aris", "Last Name": "Floratos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley", "Last Name": "Sawle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iuliana", "Last Name": "Ionita-Laza", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Ottman", "Affiliation": "G.H Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lorraine N", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "European journal of human genetics : EJHG", "PubDate": "2016Jul"}, {"PMID": "26121088", "Title": "The support of human genetic evidence for approved drug indications.", "Abstract": "Over a quarter of drugs that enter clinical development fail because they are ineffective.

We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0% at the preclinical stage to 8.2% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas.

Both are characterized by distinctive blistering lesions and significant mortality rates. While there is evidence for strong drug-specific genetic predisposition related to HLA alleles, recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) on European and Asian populations have failed to identify genetic susceptibility alleles that are common across multiple drugs. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the low to moderate effect size of individual genetic risk factors. To test this hypothesis we developed Pointer, a new algorithm that assesses the aggregate effect of multiple low risk variants on a pathway using a gene set enrichment approach. A key advantage of our method is the capability to associate SNPs with genes by exploiting physical proximity as well as by using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that capture information about both cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects. We control for known bias-inducing aspects of enrichment based analyses, such as: 1) gene length, 2) gene set size, 3) presence of biologically related genes within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and, 4) genes shared among multiple gene sets. We applied this approach to publicly available SJS/TEN genome-wide genotype data and identified the ABC transporter and Proteasome pathways as potentially implicated in the genetic susceptibility of non-drug-specific SJS/TEN. We demonstrated that the innovative SNP-to-gene mapping phase of the method was essential in detecting the significant enrichment for those pathways. Analysis of an independent gene expression dataset provides supportive functional evidence for the involvement of Proteasome pathways in SJS/TEN cutaneous lesions. These results suggest that Pointer provides a useful framework for the integrative analysis of pharmacogenetic GWAS data, by increasing the power to detect aggregate effects of multiple low risk variants.

Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants.
