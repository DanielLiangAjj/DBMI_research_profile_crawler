Shedding and Rapid Antigen Test Performance - Respiratory Virus Transmission Network, November 2022-May 2023.", "Abstract": "As population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 evolves and new variants emerge, the role and accuracy of antigen tests remain active questions. To describe recent test performance, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen testing was compared with that by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture testing during November 2022-May 2023. Participants who were enrolled in a household transmission study completed daily symptom diaries and collected two nasal swabs (tested for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR, culture, and antigen tests) each day for 10 days after enrollment. Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the percentages of positive antigen, RT-PCR, and culture results were calculated each day from the onset of symptoms or, in asymptomatic persons, from the date of the first positive test result. Antigen test sensitivity was calculated using RT-PCR and viral culture as references. The peak percentage of positive antigen (59.0%) and RT-PCR (83.0%) results occurred 3 days after onset, and the peak percentage of positive culture results (52%) occurred 2 days after onset. The sensitivity of antigen tests was 47% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a044%-50%) and 80% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a076%-85%) using RT-PCR and culture, respectively, as references. Clinicians should be aware of the lower sensitivity of antigen testing compared with RT-PCR, which might lead to false-negative results. This finding has implications for timely initiation of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment, when early diagnosis is essential; clinicians should consider RT-PCR for persons for whom antiviral treatment is recommended. Persons in the community who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness and eligible for antiviral treatment should seek testing from health care providers with the goal of obtaining a more sensitive diagnostic test than antigen tests (i.e., an RT-PCR test).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19 Serological Testing", "Adult", "Virus Shedding", "Antigens, Viral", "Male", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Female", "Middle Aged", "COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing", "Young Adult", "Adolescent", "United States", "Aged", "COVID-19 Testing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Smith-Jeffcoat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra M", "Last Name": "Mellis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos G", "Last Name": "Grijalva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H Keipp", "Last Name": "Talbot", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Schmitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Lutrick", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine D", "Last Name": "Ellingson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa S", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Son H", "Last Name": "McLaren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Huong Q", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suchitra", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edwin J", "Last Name": "Asturias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meredith E", "Last Name": "Davis-Gardner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mehul S", "Last Name": "Suthar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hannah L", "Last Name": "Kirking", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "RVTN-Sentinel Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "MMWR.

During December 19, 2021-October 29, 2023, the Overcoming COVID-19 Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of \u22652 original monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses against COVID-19-related hospitalization and critical illness among U.S. children and adolescents aged 5-18 years, using a case-control design. Too few children and adolescents received bivalent or updated monovalent vaccines to separately evaluate their effectiveness. Most case-patients (persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result) were unvaccinated, despite the high frequency of reported underlying conditions associated with severe COVID-19. VE of the original monovalent vaccine against COVID-19-related hospitalizations was 52% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a033%-66%) when the most recent dose was administered <120 days before hospitalization and 19% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02%-32%) if the interval was 120-364 days. VE of the original monovalent vaccine against COVID-19-related hospitalization was 31% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a018%-43%) if the last dose was received any time within the previous year.

VE was similar after excluding children and adolescents with documented immunocompromising conditions.

Telelactation to Provide Ongoing Breastfeeding Support to a Diverse Patient Population.", "Abstract": "Background: Patients from low-income, minoritized communities have limited access to outpatient breastfeeding support with International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs). Telelactation may increase access particularly when appointments can be self-scheduled. Objective: To describe a medical center-based, outpatient breastfeeding support program that includes telelactation and serves a diverse patient population. Methods and Study Design: A retrospective electronic chart review was performed for patients with in-person or telelactation visit types between April 2020 and December 2021. Impact of demographics (language, race/ethnicity, insurance) on scheduling patterns (self-scheduled versus traditionally scheduled), visit reasons, and impact of initial visit type and reason on subsequent follow-ups were determined. Feeding practice-to-feeding goal ratios were compared between initial and last visit to determine if breastfeeding goals were met. Descriptive statistics, linear regression, chi-square, and paired t-tests were performed. Results: Two thousand twenty-three patients (37.9% Spanish-speakers, 76.6% Latinx; 8.0% black/non-Latinx, 79.0% publicly insured) made 2,791 visits, of which 50.6% were for telelactation. Self-scheduling resulted in decreased no show rates (25.3% versus 42.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Commercially insured patients had greater odds of self-scheduling versus publicly insured (adjusted odds ratio: 9.22; 95% confidence interval, CI [6.27-13.57]) with no impact of race/ethnicity or language. Reasons for visit differed slightly by initial visit type. Practice-to-feeding goal ratios increased regardless of initial visit type: telelactation visit (0.84 to 0.88 [difference 0.04; 95% CI: 0.006-0.066; p\u2009=\u20090.017]); and in-person visit (0.77 to 0.84 [difference 0.07; 95% CI: 0.044-0.11 p\u2009<\u20090.001]). Conclusions: Telelactation as part of a medical center-based outpatient breastfeeding support program is a promising modality for both initial and follow-up visits. Self-scheduling decreased no show rates.", "Keywords": ["breastfeeding goals", "feeding practices", "outpatient breastfeeding support", "telelactation"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Breast Feeding", "Outpatients", "Retrospective Studies", "Telemedicine", "Longitudinal Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa E", "Last Name": "Glassman", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alisha P", "Last Name": "Sarakki", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debra", "Last Name": "Katz-Feigenbaum", "Affiliation": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenna", "Last Name": "Zitaner", "Affiliation": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priyam", "Last Name": "Thind", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa S", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "37036706", "Title": "Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants With and Without Exposure to Asymptomatic or Mild Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy.", "Abstract": "Associations between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes have substantial public health relevance.

Sequence data from infections among household members can define the expected genomic diversity of a virus along a defined transmission chain. SARS-CoV-2 cases were identified prospectively among 2,369 participants in 706 households. Specimens with a reverse transcription-PCR cycle threshold of \u226430 underwent whole-genome sequencing. Intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNV) were identified at a \u22655% frequency. Phylogenetic trees were used to evaluate the relationship of household and community sequences. There were 178 SARS-CoV-2 cases in 706 households. Among 147 specimens sequenced, 106 yielded a whole-genome consensus with coverage suitable for identifying iSNV. Twenty-six households had sequences from multiple cases within 14\u2009days. Consensus sequences were indistinguishable among cases in 15 households, while 11 had \u22651 consensus sequence that differed by 1 to 2 mutations. Sequences from households and the community were often interspersed on phylogenetic trees. Identification of iSNV improved inference in 2 of 15 households with indistinguishable consensus sequences and in 6 of 11 with distinct ones. In multiple-infection households, whole-genome consensus sequences differed by 0 to 1 mutations. Identification of shared iSNV occasionally resolved linkage, but the low genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 limits the utility of \"sequence-only\" transmission inference. IMPORTANCE We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from prospectively identified cases in three longitudinal household cohorts. In a majority of multi-infection households, SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences were indistinguishable, and they differed by 1 to 2 mutations in the rest. Importantly, even with modest genomic surveillance of the community (3 to 5% of cases sequenced), it was not uncommon to find community sequences interspersed with household sequences on phylogenetic trees. Identification of shared minority variants only occasionally resolved these ambiguities in transmission linkage. Overall, the low genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 limits the utility of \"sequence-only\" transmission inference. Our work highlights the need to carefully consider both epidemiologic linkage and sequence data to define transmission chains in households, hospitals, and other transmission settings.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2", "genomic epidemiology", "household", "transmission"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "Phylogeny", "Reproducibility of Results", "Genome, Viral", "Genomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily E", "Last Name": "Bendall", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela", "Last Name": "Paz-Bailey", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gilberto A", "Last Name": "Santiago", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina A", "Last Name": "Porucznik", "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph B", "Last Name": "Stanford", "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa S", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jazmin", "Last Name": "Duque", "Affiliation": "Abt Associates, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zuha", "Last Name": "Jeddy", "Affiliation": "Abt Associates, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vic", "Last Name": "Veguilla", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "Rivera-Amill", "Affiliation": "Ponce Research Institute, Ponce Health Sciences University, Ponce, Puerto Rico, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa A", "Last Name": "Rolfes", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fatimah S", "Last Name": "Dawood", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Lauring", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2022Dec21"}, {"PMID": "36357976", "Title": "Agreement Between Pregnant Individuals' Self-Report of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination and Medical Record Documentation.", "Abstract": "For public health research such as vaccine uptake or effectiveness assessments, self-reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination status may be a more efficient measure than verifying vaccination status from medical records if agreement between sources is high.

Omicron sublineages BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 emerged later and by late April 2022, accounted for most cases.* Estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) can be reduced by newly emerging variants or sublineages that evade vaccine-induced immunity (1), protection from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated persons (2), or increasing time since vaccination (3). Real-world data comparing VE during the periods when the BA.1 and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 predominated (BA.1 period and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, respectively) are limited. The VISION network\u2020 examined 214,487 emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits and 58,782 hospitalizations with a COVID-19-like illness\u00a7 diagnosis among 10 states during December 18, 2021-June 10, 2022, to evaluate VE of 2, 3, and 4 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) compared with no vaccination among adults without immunocompromising conditions. VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization 7-119 days and \u2265120 days after receipt of dose 3 was 92% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a091%-93%) and 85% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a081%-89%), respectively, during the BA.1 period, compared with 69% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a058%-76%) and 52% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a044%-59%), respectively, during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period. Patterns were similar for ED/UC encounters.

We compared specimen alternatives and evaluated SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability under simulated shipping conditions. We compared concordance of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from flocked midturbinate swabs (MTS) in viral transport media (VTM), foam MTS without VTM, and saliva. Specimens were collected between August 2020 and April 2021 from three prospective cohorts. We compared RT-PCR cycle quantification (Cq) for Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and the Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF) genes for flocked MTS and saliva specimens tested before and after exposure to a range of storage temperatures (4-30\u00b0C) and times (2, 3, and 7\u2009days). Of 1,900 illnesses with \u22652 specimen types tested, 335 (18%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in \u22651 specimen; 304 (91%) were concordant across specimen types. Among illnesses with SARS-CoV-2 detection, 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-98%) were positive on flocked MTS, 99% (95% CI: 97-100%) on saliva, and 89% (95% CI: 84-93%) on foam MTS. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in flocked MTS and saliva stored up to 30\u00b0C for 7\u2009days. All specimen types provided highly concordant SARS-CoV-2 results. These findings support a range of viable options for specimen types, collection, and transport methods that may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 testing during supply and personnel shortages. IMPORTANCE Findings from this analysis indicate that (1) self-collection of flocked and foam MTS and saliva samples is feasible in both adults and children, (2) foam MTS with VTM and saliva are both viable and reasonable alternatives to traditional flocked MTS in VTM for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and (3) these sample types may be stored and transported at ambient temperatures for up to 7\u2009days without compromising sample quality. These findings support methods of sample collection for SARS-CoV-2 detection that may facilitate widespread community testing in the setting of supply and personnel shortages during the current pandemic.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "RT-PCR", "SARS-CoV-2", "respiratory specimens", "sensitivity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Testing", "Child", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "Saliva", "Specimen Handling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vic", "Last Name": "Veguilla", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley L", "Last Name": "Fowlkes", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Preventiongrid.416738.f, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Bissonnette", "Affiliation": "Integrated Research & Development Laboratory, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shawn", "Last Name": "Beitel", "Affiliation": "Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manjusha", "Last Name": "Gaglani", "Affiliation": "Baylor Scott and White Health, Temple, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina A", "Last Name": "Porucznik", "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa S", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Health, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harmony L", "Last Name": "Tyner", "Affiliation": "St. Luke's Regional Health Care System, Duluth, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison L", "Last Name": "Naleway", "Affiliation": "Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research, Portland, Oregon, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarang K", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto J", "Last Name": "Caban-Martinez", "Affiliation": "Leonard M.

This recommendation was made in light of the risks for rare but serious adverse events following receipt of a Janssen vaccine, including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u2020 (1), and clinical trial data indicating similar or higher neutralizing antibody response following heterologous boosting compared with homologous boosting (2). Data on real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) of different booster strategies following a primary Janssen vaccine dose are limited, particularly during the period of Omicron variant predominance. The VISION Network\u00a7 determined real-world VE of 1 Janssen vaccine dose and 2 alternative booster dose strategies: 1) a homologous booster (i.e., 2 Janssen doses) and 2) a heterologous mRNA booster (i.e., 1 Janssen dose/1 mRNA dose). In addition, VE of these booster strategies was compared with VE of a homologous booster following mRNA primary series vaccination (i.e., 3 mRNA doses). The study examined 80,287 emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits\u00b6 and 25,244 hospitalizations across 10 states during December 16, 2021-March 7, 2022, when Omicron was the predominant circulating variant.** VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters was 24% after 1 Janssen dose, 54% after 2 Janssen doses, 79% after 1 Janssen/1 mRNA dose, and 83% after 3 mRNA doses. VE for the same vaccination strategies against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were 31%, 67%, 78%, and 90%, respectively. All booster strategies provided higher protection than a single Janssen dose against ED/UC visits and hospitalizations during Omicron variant predominance. Vaccination with 1 Janssen/1 mRNA dose provided higher protection than did 2 Janssen doses against COVID-19-associated ED/UC visits and was comparable to protection provided by 3 mRNA doses during the first 120 days after a booster dose. However, 3 mRNA doses provided higher protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations than did other booster strategies during the same time interval since booster dose. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines for their COVID-19 primary series vaccination should receive an mRNA booster dose when eligible.

Limited real-world data on 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in persons aged 12-17 years (referred to as adolescents in this report) have also indicated high levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (4-6); however, data on VE against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant and duration of protection are limited. Pfizer-BioNTech VE data are not available for children aged 5-11 years. In partnership with CDC, the VISION Network* examined 39,217 emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters and 1,699 hospitalizations\u2020 among persons aged 5-17 years with COVID-19-like illness across 10 states during April 9, 2021-January 29, 2022,\u00a7 to estimate VE using a case-control test-negative design. Among children aged 5-11 years, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters 14-67 days after dose 2 (the longest interval after dose 2 in this age group) was 46%. Among adolescents aged 12-15 and 16-17 years, VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 83% and 76%, respectively; VE \u2265150 days after dose 2 was 38% and 46%, respectively. Among adolescents aged 16-17 years, VE increased to 86% \u22657 days after dose 3 (booster dose). VE against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was substantially lower during the Omicron predominant period than the B.1.617.2 (Delta) predominant period among adolescents aged 12-17 years, with no significant protection \u2265150 days after dose 2 during Omicron predominance. However, in adolescents aged 16-17 years, VE during the Omicron predominant period increased to 81% \u22657 days after a third booster dose. During the full study period, including pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron predominant periods, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization among children aged 5-11 years was 74% 14-67 days after dose 2, with wide CIs that included zero. Among adolescents aged 12-15 and 16-17 years, VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 92% and 94%, respectively; VE \u2265150 days after dose 2 was 73% and 88%, respectively.

Therefore, reminder and recall interventions (R/R) are recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services for increasing immunization rates on the basis of strong evidence. R/R messages can be delivered by mail (letter or postcard), via personal or auto-dialer phone calls, by text or e-mail or via patient-portals and can simply be alerts to action or can include educational material with the aim of motivating patients to seek vaccination. R/R has also been shown to be a relatively low-cost intervention with high cost-effectiveness compared with other recommended strategies. However, although R/R as a strategy is consistently effective and cost-effective overall, there is wide variation in the impact of R/R by 1) modality of how it is delivered, 2) the targeted vaccine, 3) the age group, and 4) whether the R/R is conducted centrally by a health system or Immunization Information System or by individual practices. This narrative review summarizes the literature about effectiveness of R/R within each of these categories. We also discuss limitations of R/R, with a focus on the potential impact of parental vaccine hesitancy in blunting its effectiveness and problems with data integrity, on which R/R relies.

Currently, only half of those receiving the first dose receive a second.

As part of a national-randomized control trial of second dose text-message influenza vaccine reminders (2017-2018 season), a telephone survey collected caregiver and index child demographic information. Each child had received the first of two needed influenza vaccine doses. Caregivers completed a measure of general vaccine hesitancy - the five-question Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines Survey Tool (PACV-5) - and questions about influenza infection and vaccine. We assessed associations between participant demographic characteristics, vaccine hesitancy, and influenza beliefs and calculated the standardized proportion of caregivers endorsing each outcome using logistic regression. Analyses included responses from 256 participants from 36 primary care practices in 24 states. Some caregivers (11.7%) reported moderate/high vaccine hesitancy and many had misperceptions about influenza disease and vaccine. In multivariable models, no single variable was consistently associated with inaccurate knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. These results demonstrate that caregivers whose children received the first dose of influenza vaccine may still be vaccine hesitant and have inaccurate influenza beliefs.

Previous studies have described negative predictors of vaccination; however, there is a knowledge gap of how influenza vaccine-specific beliefs affect vaccination rates. We examined the relationship between influenza vaccine health beliefs and vaccination behaviors in a cross sectional sample of 200 primarily Hispanic patients aged \u226565\u00a0years in an academic general internal medicine clinic. Participants were asked about perceptions of influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety. Interview responses regarding influenza vaccine concerns were evaluated qualitatively with conventional content analysis. Logistic regression evaluated associations between beliefs and self-reported vaccination the previous year, adjusted for age, gender, and language. Of those approached to complete the questionnaire, 88% participated. Self-reported influenza vaccination rate during the study year was 75%. Only 46.5% endorsed the belief that influenza vaccine is very effective and 47% that it is very safe. Many stated specific concerns about flu vaccine including that it causes side effects/adverse outcomes, is not effective, vaccine components are harmful, and vaccination is not necessary. Belief that the flu shot causes the flu and concern for variability of the flu shot were associated with reduced odds of vaccination (aOR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.83] and 0.06 [0.006, 0.63] respectively). The patient-perceived distinction between cold, flu, and other symptoms warrants further exploration.

We have performed such a trial with 80 students in an undergraduate biochemistry class, in which students were randomized to either learning in groups or learning individually. All students participated in the same class, which consisted of a lecture with periodic breaks for students to solve problems using an audience response system. Students in the individual learning condition answered these questions on their own, but students in the group-based learning condition answered these questions in an assigned group of four students. At the end of the class, all students then took the same exam as individuals. The exam had two types of questions-recall questions, in which students had to simply recall information provided to them, and predict questions, in which students had to apply their new knowledge to a new context. Students in the individual and group-based learning conditions performed similarly well on recall questions. However, students who had been in the group-based learning condition performed significantly better as individuals on the predict questions.

During the 44-week period from December 2012 through September 2013, 11,282 text messages were sent.

Recent data indicate that many of these children fail to receive one or both of these needed doses. Contributing factors to under-vaccination of this population remain unclear. Caregivers of children aged 6 months-8 years requiring two influenza vaccine doses in the 2010-2011 season were identified from households enrolled in four urban Head Start programs. Recruitment and survey administration were conducted between March and June 2011. The impact of caregiver, provider, and practice-based factors on influenza vaccine receipt was assessed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Caregivers (n = 128) were predominantly mothers, Latina, Spanish-speaking, and non-U.S. born. Few children received one (31 %) or both (7 %) influenza vaccine doses. Caregivers who discussed influenza vaccination with providers were more likely to know their child needed two doses (55 vs. 35 %, p < 0.05) and have a fully vaccinated child (11 vs. 0 %, p < 0.05).
