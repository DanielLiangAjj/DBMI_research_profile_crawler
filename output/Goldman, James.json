However, the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we combined single-cell analyses of FTD patient brains with a stem cell culture and transplantation model of FTD. We identified disease phenotypes in FTD neurons carrying the MAPT-N279K mutation, which were related to oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation with an upregulation of the inflammation-associated protein osteopontin (OPN). Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts. Notably, downregulation of OPN in engrafted FTD neurons resulted in improved engraftment and reduced microglial infiltration, indicating an immune-modulatory role of OPN in patient neurons, which may represent a potential therapeutic target in FTD.", "Keywords": ["FTD", "MAPT N279K", "OPN", "Spp1", "Tau", "disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia", "induced pluripotent stem cells", "microglia", "neuroinflammation", "osteopontin", "single nucleus RNA sequencing", "snRNA-seq", "transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Osteopontin", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Neurons", "Animals", "tau Proteins", "Mice", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Microglia", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA;

Here we describe post-zygotic rescue of meiotic errors as an alternate origin of brain mosaicism in patients with focal epilepsy who have mosaic chromosome 1q copy number gains. Genomic analysis showed evidence of an extra parentally derived chromosome 1q allele in the resected brain tissue from five of six patients. This copy number gain is observed only in patient brain tissue, but not in blood or buccal cells, and is strongly enriched in astrocytes. Astrocytes carrying chromosome 1q gains exhibit distinct gene expression signatures and hyaline inclusions, supporting a novel genetic association for astrocytic inclusions in epilepsy.

incurable neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss and astrogliosis. One hallmark of HD is the selective neuronal vulnerability of striatal medium spiny neurons. To date, the underlying mechanisms of this selective vulnerability have not been fully defined. Here, we employed a multi-omic approach including single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq), bulk RNAseq, lipidomics, HTT gene CAG repeat length measurements, and multiplexed immunofluorescence on post-mortem brain tissue from multiple brain regions of HD and control donors. We defined a signature of genes that is driven by CAG repeat length and found it enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. Moreover, weighted gene correlation network analysis showed loss of connectivity of astrocytic and microglial modules in HD and identified modules that correlated with CAG-repeat length which further implicated inflammatory pathways and metabolism. We performed lipidomic analysis of HD and control brains and identified several lipid species that correlate with HD grade, including ceramides and very long chain fatty acids. Integration of lipidomics and bulk transcriptomics identified a consensus gene signature that correlates with HD grade and HD lipidomic abnormalities and implicated the unfolded protein response pathway. Because astrocytes are critical for brain lipid metabolism and play important roles in regulating inflammation, we analyzed our snRNAseq dataset with an emphasis on astrocyte pathology. We found two main astrocyte types that spanned multiple brain regions; these types correspond to protoplasmic astrocytes, and fibrous-like - CD44-positive, astrocytes. HD pathology was differentially associated with these cell types in a region-specific manner. One protoplasmic astrocyte cluster showed high expression of metallothionein genes, the depletion of this cluster positively correlated with the depletion of vulnerable medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus. We confirmed that metallothioneins were increased in cingulate HD astrocytes but were unchanged or even decreased in caudate astrocytes. We combined existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a GWA study conducted on HD patients from the original Venezuelan cohort and identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the metallothionein gene locus associated with delayed age of onset. Functional studies found that metallothionein overexpressing astrocytes are better able to buffer glutamate and were neuroprotective of patient-derived directly reprogrammed HD MSNs as well as against rotenone-induced neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we found that metallothionein-overexpressing astrocytes increased the phagocytic activity of microglia in vitro and increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid binding. Together, we identified an astrocytic phenotype that is regionally-enriched in less vulnerable brain regions that can be leveraged to protect neurons in HD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fahad", "Last Name": "Paryani", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ji-Sun", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "Chris W", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Biological Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Nacoya", "Last Name": "Madden", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Ofori", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Juncheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Shawn M", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "Princeton University, Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Basile", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "McHugh", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center."}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Hickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Zody", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center."}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Houseman", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Biological Engineering."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Andrew S", "Last Name": "Yoo", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Sep12"}, {"PMID": "37515770", "Title": "The stability of the myelinating oligodendrocyte transcriptome is regulated by the nuclear lamina.", "Abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that insulate and support axons with their myelin membrane, allowing proper brain function.

Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination.

The burden of pathology is most pronounced in the brain stem including the medulla oblongata. Hypoxic/ischemic damage is the most frequent neuropathologic abnormality. Other neuropathologic features include neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases: astrogliosis and microglial reactivity. It is still unknown if these pathologies are secondary to hypoxia versus a combination of inflammatory response combined with hypoxia. It is also unknown how astrocytes react to neuroinflammation in COVID-19, especially considering evidence supporting the neurotoxicity of certain astrocytic phenotypes. This study aims to define the link between astrocytic and microglial pathology in COVID-19 victims in the inferior olivary nucleus, which is one of the most severely affected brain regions in COVID-19, and establish whether COVID-19 pathology is driven by hypoxic damage. Here, we conducted neuropathologic assessments and multiplex-immunofluorescence studies on the medulla oblongata of 18 COVID-19, 10 pre-pandemic patients who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 7-8 control patients with no ARDS or COVID-19. The comparison of ARDS and COVID-19 allows us to identify whether the pathology in COVID-19 can be explained by hypoxia alone, which is common to both conditions. Our results showed increased olivary astrogliosis in ARDS and COVID-19. However, microglial density and microglial reactivity were increased only in COVID-19, in a region-specific manner. Also, olivary hilar astrocytes increased YKL-40 (CHI3L1) in COVID-19, but to a lesser extent than ARDS astrocytes. COVID-19 astrocytes also showed lower levels of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and Metallothionein-3 in subsets of COVID-19 brain regions. Cluster analysis on immunohistochemical attributes of astrocytes and microglia identified ARDS and COVID-19 clusters with correlations to clinical history and disease course. Our results indicate that olivary glial pathology and neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 cannot be explained solely by hypoxia and suggest that failure of astrocytes to upregulate the anti-inflammatory YKL-40 may contribute to the neuroinflammation. Notwithstanding the limitations of retrospective studies in establishing causality, our experimental design cannot adequately control for factors external to our design. Perturbative studies are needed to confirm the role of the above-described astrocytic phenotypes in neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "astrocyte", "hypoxia", "inferior olivary nucleus", "microglia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nacoya", "Last Name": "Madden", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ying Zi Jessy", "Last Name": "Mei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juncheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37443768", "Title": "TMEM106B Puncta Is Increased in Multiple Sclerosis Plaques, and Reduced Protein in Mice Results in Delayed Lipid Clearance Following CNS Injury.", "Abstract": "During inflammatory, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammation and axonal damage are prevalent early in the course. Axonal damage includes swelling, defects in transport, and failure to clear damaged intracellular proteins, all of which affect recovery and compromise neuronal integrity. The clearance of damaged cell components is important to maintain normal turnover and restore homeostasis. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify insoluble proteins within high-speed/mercaptoethanol/sarcosyl-insoluble pellets from purified white matter plaques isolated from the brains of individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). We determined that the transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B), normally lysosome-associated, is insoluble in RRMS plaques relative to normal-appearing white matter from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and non-neurologic controls. Relative to wild-type mice, hypomorphic mice with a reduction in TMEM106B have increased axonal damage and lipid droplet accumulation in the spinal cord following myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additionally, the corpora callosa from cuprizone-challenged hypomorphic mice fail to clear lipid droplets efficiently during remyelination, suggesting that when TMEM106B is compromised, protein and lipid clearance by the lysosome is delayed.

regions and cell types is a challenge for Huntington's disease (HD) treatment. Here we use single nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate molecular pathology in the cortex and striatum from R6/2 mice and human HD post-mortem tissue. We identify cell type-specific and -agnostic signatures suggesting oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) are arrested in intermediate maturation states. OL-lineage regulators OLIG1 and OLIG2 are negatively correlated with CAG length in human OPCs, and ATACseq analysis of HD mouse NeuN-negative cells shows decreased accessibility regulated by OL maturation genes. The data implicates glucose and lipid metabolism in abnormal cell maturation and identify PRKCE and Thiamine Pyrophosphokinase 1 (TPK1) as central genes. Thiamine/biotin treatment of R6/1 HD mice to compensate for TPK1 dysregulation restores OL maturation and rescues neuronal pathology.

study of military traumatic brain injury (TBI). The woman died due to a polysubstance drug overdose, with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) serving as a contributing factor. Immunohistochemical stains for \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), routinely performed for the TBI study, revealed numerous, unusual neocortical A\u03b2 deposits. We investigated the autopsied brains of 10 additional young patients (<60\u2009years old) who died of COVID-19, and found similar A\u03b2 deposits in all, using two different A\u03b2 antibodies across three different medical centers. The deposits failed to stain with Thioflavin-S. To investigate whether or not these deposits formed uniquely to COVID-19, we applied A\u03b2 immunostains to the autopsied brains of COVID-19-negative adults who died with acute respiratory distress syndrome and infants with severe cardiac anomalies, and also biopsy samples from patients with subacute cerebral infarcts. Cortical A\u03b2 deposits were also found in these cases, suggesting a link to hypoxia. The fate of these deposits and their effects on function are unknown, but it is possible that they contribute to the neurocognitive sequelae observed in some COVID-19 patients.

One such cell type is the oligodendrocyte, whose myelin sheaths are central for the reliable conduction of action potentials. Using an integrated approach of mouse genetics, live cell imaging, electron microscopy, and biochemistry, we show that mature oligodendrocytes require macroautophagy to degrade cell autonomously their myelin by consolidating cytosolic and transmembrane myelin proteins into an amphisome intermediate prior to degradation. We find that disruption of autophagic myelin turnover leads to changes in myelin sheath structure, ultimately impairing neural function and culminating in an adult-onset progressive motor decline, neurodegeneration, and death.

Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "astrogliosis", "cortical hyperexcitability", "cytomegalic dysplastic neurons", "epileptogenesis", "tuberous sclerosis complex"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Pyramidal Cells", "Seizures", "Tuberous Sclerosis", "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wudu", "Last Name": "Lado", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jia Jie", "Last Name": "Teoh", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahrom", "Last Name": "Ham", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian J A", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n\u2009=\u200916), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n\u2009=\u200948), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n\u2009=\u200944), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n\u2009=\u200915). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P\u2009=\u20090.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical syndromes caused by germline variants, as well as including some not previously associated with radiographically evident cortical brain malformations.", "Keywords": ["epilepsy", "exome sequencing",

Using label-free quantitative proteomic comparisons of brain tissue from GFAPTg;Gfap+/R236H\u00a0versus wild-type mice confirmed upregulation of the glutathione metabolism pathway and indicated proteins were elevated in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, which had not been reported previously in AxD. Relative protein-level differences were confirmed by a targeted proteomics assay, including proteins related to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Of particular interest was the decreased level of the oligodendrocyte protein, 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase (Ugt8), since Ugt8-deficient mice exhibit a phenotype similar to GFAPTg;Gfap+/R236H mice (e.g., tremors, ataxia, hind-limb paralysis). In addition, decreased levels of myelin-associated proteins were found in the GFAPTg;Gfap+/R236H mice, consistent with the role of Ugt8 in myelin synthesis. Fabp7 upregulation in GFAPTg;Gfap+/R236H mice was also selected for further investigation due to its uncharacterized association to AxD, critical function in astrocyte proliferation, and functional ability to inhibit the anti-inflammatory PPAR signaling pathway in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Within Gfap+ astrocytes, Fabp7 was markedly increased in the hippocampus, a brain region subjected to extensive pathology and chronic reactive gliosis in GFAPTg;Gfap+/R236H mice.

Hospital.", "Abstract": "Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop neurological signs and symptoms; although, to date, little evidence exists that primary infection of the brain is a significant contributing factor. We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

coordinated partnership between odorant flow and neuronal communication. Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marianna", "Last Name": "Zazhytska", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

We point out the shortcomings of binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad, neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional parameters-preferably in vivo-plus multivariate statistics and determination of impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models.

In neonatal mice and cultured differentiating oligodendrocytes, sublethal intermittent hypoxic (IH) stress activated cyclophilin D-dependent mitochondrial proton leak and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, leading to transient bioenergetic stress. This was associated with development of diffuse WMI: poor oligodendrocyte maturation, diffuse axonal hypomyelination, and permanent sensorimotor deficit. In normoxic mice and oligodendrocytes, exposure to a mitochondrial uncoupler recapitulated the phenotype of WMI, supporting the detrimental role of mitochondrial uncoupling in the pathogenesis of WMI. Compared with WT mice, cyclophilin D-knockout littermates did not develop bioenergetic stress in response to IH challenge and fully preserved oligodendrocyte maturation, axonal myelination, and neurofunction.

Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified. Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important. In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report. We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's patients with COVID-19.

His most recent admission identified hyperintensities within the brainstem by MRI and despite antibiotic therapies for suspected CNS infection, he died. Autopsy revealed a swollen brain with marked widening of the brainstem. Microscopic examination of the brain and spinal cord showed focal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and neuronal loss that were associated with acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The brainstem was the most severely damaged and AFB were found to congregate along arterial territories lending support to the notion of hematogenous spread as a mechanism for the organisms' dissemination. 16S rRNA sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue enabled post-mortem identification of M. haemophilum.

In this study, we focused on astrocytes, although we found significant gene expression differences in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia as well. In particular, the gene expression profiles of astrocytes in HD showed multiple signatures, varying in phenotype from cells that had markedly upregulated metallothionein and heat shock genes, but had not completely lost the expression of genes associated with normal protoplasmic astrocytes, to astrocytes that had substantially upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and had lost expression of many normal protoplasmic astrocyte genes as well as metallothionein genes.

Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD, but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown. We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young, independently of the mutation they carried. AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo.

The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation.", "Keywords": ["Borrelia burgdorferi", "Lyme disease", "antibiotic resistance", "biofilms", "persisters", "spirochete"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Sapi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. esapi@newhaven.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rumanah S", "Last Name": "Kasliwala", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. rumanahk@yahoo.com."}, {"First Name": "Hebo", "Last Name": "Ismail", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. heboismail@yahoo.com."}, {"First Name": "Jason P", "Last Name": "Torres", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. jaypaultorres@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Oldakowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. molda1@unh.newhaven.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Markland", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. smark4@unh.newhaven.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gauri", "Last Name": "Gaur", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. ggaur2@unh.newhaven.edu."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Melillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of New Haven, West Haven, CT 06516, USA. amelillo@newhaven.edu."}, {"First Name": "Klaus", "Last Name": "Eisendle", "Affiliation": "Central Teaching Hospital Bolzano L B\u00f6hlerstr, 539100 Bolzano, Italy. klaus.eisendle@sabes.it."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth B", "Last Name": "Liegner", "Affiliation": "Private practice, 592 Route 22, Suite 1B, Pawling, NY 12564, USA. kbliegnermd@optonline.net."}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Libien", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY 11203, USA.

On two-dimensional gels, this protein resolved into four distinct species. Electrophoretic and immunological evidence suggests that this 44\u00a0kDa protein is a derivative of HspB5, most likely a covalently linked HspB5 dimer. This HspB5-like 44\u00a0kDa protein (HspB5L-P44) is particularly abundant in rat heart, brain, and renal cortex and glomeruli. HspB5L-P44 was also found in human brains, including those from patients with Alexander disease, a condition distinguished by cerebral accumulation of HspB5. Gray matter of such a patient contained an elevated amount of HspB5L-P44. A spatial model of structurally ordered dimeric HspB5 \u03b1-crystallin domains reveals the exposed and adjacent position of the two peptide segments homologous to the HspB1-derived 8A7 antigen determinant peptide (epitope). This explains the observed extraordinary high avidity of the 8A7 antibody towards HspB5L-P44, as opposed to commonly used HspB5-specific antibodies which recognize other epitopes. This scenario also explains the remarkable fact that no previous study reported the existence of HspB5L-P44 species. Exposure of rat endothelial cells to UV light, an oxidative stress condition, temporarily increased HspB5L-P44, suggesting physiological regulation of the dimerization.

We have used mouse models of AxD based on the overexpression of human GFAP (transgenic, TG) and a point mutation in mouse GFAP (knock-in, KI) to examine the formation of RFs and to find astrocyte changes that correlate with the appearance of RFs. We found RFs of various sizes and shapes. The smallest ones appear as granular depositions on intermediate filaments. These contain GFAP and the small heat shock protein, alphaB-crystallin. Their aggregation appears to give rise to large RFs. The appearance of new RFs and the growth of previously formed RFs occur over time. We determined that DAPI is a reliable marker of RFs and in parallel with Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining defined a high variability in the appearance of RFs, even in neighboring astrocytes. Although many astrocytes in AxD with increased levels of GFAP and with or without RFs change their phenotype, only some cells with large numbers of RFs show a profound reconstruction of cellular processes, with a loss of fine distal processes and the appearance of large, lobulated nuclei, likely due to arrested mitosis. We conclude that 1) RFs appear to originate as small, osmiophilic masses containing both GFAP and alphaB-crystallin deposited on bundles of intermediate filaments. 2) RFs continue to form within AxD astrocytes over time. 3) DAPI is a reliable marker for RFs and can be used with immunolabeling. 4) RFs appear to interfere with the successful completion of astrocyte mitosis and cell division.", "Keywords": ["Alexander disease", "Astrocytes", "GFAP", "Rosenthal fibers", "alphaB-crystallin"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Alexander Disease", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child, Preschool", "Cytoplasm", "Female", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Indoles", "Infant", "Male", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Mitosis", "Point Mutation", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "alpha-Crystallin B Chain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jeg5@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2017Mar31"}, {"PMID": "28196941", "Title": "Histopathological Differences Between the Anterior and Posterior Brain Arteries as a Function of Aging.", "Abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that posterior brain arteries differ pathologically from anterior brain arteries and that this difference varies with age.", "Keywords": ["basilar artery", "brain", "collagen", "elastin", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Arteries", "Autopsy", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons (W.R., J.P.M., M.S.V.E., R.S.M., J.

A second, increasingly popular model, the photothrombotic stroke, uses a laser beam to irradiate the MCA after administration of a photosensitizing dye. This widely used procedure is slowly replacing the MCAO model because of the easiness of the surgical protocol and the reproducibility of the damage. However, the photochemical reaction also results in wider microvascular injury. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of these two types of stroke in the cell survival and evolution of stroke, focusing on microglial cells, the first responders to cell injury. Two groups of heterozygote Cx3CR1-GFP reporter mice (to follow microglia) were subject to stroke injury either with coagulator-mediated occlusion or photothrombotic MCA damage. Microglial cells' dynamics of activation and phagocytosis together with astrocytic response and leukocyte infiltration were characterized at 1, 3 and 7days after damage. Photothrombotic stroke delayed microglial and astrocytic invasion of the ischemic core and accumulation of phagocytic microglia.

However, they are typically involved in a secondary response in which many cell types are affected simultaneously and therefore it is difficult to know their contributions to the pathology. Here, we show that pathological astrocytes in a mouse model of Alexander disease (AxD; GFAP (Tg);Gfap (+/R236H)) cause a pronounced immune response. We have studied the inflammatory response in the hippocampus and spinal cord of these mice and have found marked microglial activation, which follows that of astrocytes in a spatial pathological progression, as shown by increased levels of Iba1 and microglial cell (Iba1+) density. RNA sequencing and subsequent gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that a majority of the most upregulated genes in GFAP (Tg);Gfap (+/R236H) mice are directly associated with immune function and that cytokine and chemokine GO attributes represent nearly a third of the total immune attributes. Cytokine and chemokine analysis showed CXCL10 and CCL2 to be the most and earliest increased molecules, showing concentrations as high as EAE or stroke models. CXCL10 was localized exclusively to astrocytes while CCL2 was also present in microglia. Despite the high levels of CXCL10 and CCL2, T cell infiltration was mild and no B cells were found. Thus, mutations in GFAP are sufficient to trigger a profound inflammatory response. The cellular stress caused by the accumulation of GFAP likely leads to the production of inflammatory molecules and microglial activation. Examination of human AxD CNS tissues also revealed microglial activation and T cell infiltrates.

The most widely studied extant models, however, are strongly influenced by orthographic word frequency (e.g., Shaoul & Westbury, Behavior Research Methods, 38, 190-195, 2006). This has the implication that high-frequency closed-class words can potentially bias co-occurrence statistics. Because these closed-class words are purported to carry primarily syntactic, rather than semantic, information, the performance of corpus-based semantic space models may be improved by excluding closed-class words (using stop lists) from co-occurrence statistics, while retaining their syntactic information through other means (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and/or affixes from inflected word forms). Additionally, very little work has been done to explore the effect of employing morphological decomposition on the inflected forms of words in corpora prior to compiling co-occurrence statistics, despite (controversial) evidence that humans perform early morphological decomposition in semantic processing. In this study, we explored the impact of these factors on corpus-based semantic space models. From this study, morphological decomposition appears to significantly improve performance in word-word co-occurrence semantic space models, providing some support for the claim that sublexical information-specifically, word morphology-plays a role in lexical semantic processing. An overall decrease in performance was observed in models employing stop lists (e.g., excluding closed-class words).

In addition to grey matter pathology, white matter changes are now recognized as an important pathological feature in the emergence of the disease. Despite growing recognition of the importance of white matter abnormalities in the pathogenesis of AD, the causes of white matter degeneration are still unknown. While multiple studies propose Wallerian-like degeneration as the source of white matter change, others suggest that primary white matter pathology may be due, at least in part, to other mechanisms, including local effects of toxic A\u03b2 peptides. In the current study, we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in white matter of AD patients (n=12) compared with controls (n=10). Fresh frozen white matter samples were obtained from anterior (Brodmann area 9) and posterior (Brodmann area 1, 2 and 3) areas of post-mortem AD and control brains. ELISA was used to examine levels of soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. Total cortical neuritic plaque severity rating was derived from individual ratings in the following areas of cortex: mid-frontal, superior temporal, pre-central, inferior parietal, hippocampus (CA1), subiculum, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, amygdala and basal forebrain. Compared with controls, AD samples had higher white matter levels of both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. While no regional white matter differences were found in A\u03b2 -40, A\u03b2 -42 levels were higher in anterior regions than in posterior regions across both groups. After statistically controlling for total cortical neuritic plaque severity, differences in both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40 between the groups remained, suggesting that white matter A\u03b2 peptides accumulate independent of overall grey matter fibrillar amyloid pathology and are not simply a reflection of overall amyloid burden. These results shed light on one potential mechanism through which white matter degeneration may occur in AD.

These results suggest that activated microglia accumulate in the early postnatal SVZ and that they enhance neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis via released cytokines.", "Keywords": ["cytokine", "microglia", "neurogenesis", "neurosphere", "oligodendrogenesis", "subventricular zone"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Female", "Male", "Microglia", "Neurogenesis", "Oligodendroglia", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yukari", "Last Name": "Shigemoto-Mogami", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Division of Pharmacology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kazue", "Last Name": "Hoshikawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuko", "Last Name": "Sekino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kaoru", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Feb05"}, {"PMID": "23637186", "Title": "CD82 blocks cMet activation and overcomes hepatocyte growth factor effects on oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation.", "Abstract": "Mechanisms that regulate oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor migration and differentiation are important in normal development and in demyelinating/remyelinating conditions. We previously found that the tetraspanin CD82 is far more highly expressed in O4(+) OL precursors of the adult rat brain than those of the neonatal brain. CD82 has been physically linked to cMet, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, in tumor cells, and this interaction decreases downstream signaling. We show here that CD82 inhibits the HGF activation of cMet in neonatal and adult rat OL precursors. CD82 expression is sufficient to allow precursor differentiation into mature OLs even in the presence of HGF. In contrast, CD82 downregulation in adult O4(+)/CD82(+) cells inhibits their differentiation, decreases their accumulation of myelin proteins, and causes a reversion to less mature stages. CD82 expression in neonatal O4(+)/CD82(-) cells also blocks Rac1 activation, suggesting a possible regulatory effect on cytoskeletal organization and mobility. Thus, CD82 is a negative regulator of HGF/cMet during OL development and overcomes HGF inhibitory regulation of OL precursor maturation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Brain", "Cell Count", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Hepatocyte Growth Factor", "Humans", "Kangai-1 Protein", "Oligodendroglia", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Mela", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013May01"}, {"PMID": "23616550", "Title": "Phenotypic conversions of \"protoplasmic\" to \"reactive\" astrocytes in Alexander disease.", "Abstract": "Alexander Disease (AxD) is a primary disorder of astrocytes, caused by heterozygous mutations in GFAP, which encodes the major astrocyte intermediate filament protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Astrocytes in AxD display hypertrophy, massive increases in GFAP, and the accumulation of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic protein inclusions containing GFAP, and small heat shock proteins. To study the effects of GFAP mutations on astrocyte morphology and physiology, we have examined hippocampal astrocytes in three mouse models of AxD, a transgenic line (GFAP(Tg)) in which the normal human GFAP is expressed in several copies, a knock-in line (Gfap(+/R236H)) in which one of the Gfap genes bears an R236H mutation, and a mouse derived from the mating of these two lines (GFAP(Tg); Gfap(+/R236H)). We report changes in astrocyte phenotype in all lines, with the most severe in the GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H), resulting in the conversion of protoplasmic astrocytes to cells that have lost their bushy-like morphology because of a reduction of distal fine processes, and become multinucleated and hypertrophic. Astrocytes activate the mTOR cascade, acquire CD44, and lose GLT-1. The altered astrocytes display a microheterogeneity in phenotypes, even neighboring cells. Astrocytes also show diminished glutamate transporter current, are significantly depolarized, and not coupled to adjacent astrocytes. Thus, the accumulation of GFAP in the AxD mouse astrocytes initiates a conversion of normal, protoplasmic astrocytes to astrocytes that display severely \"reactive\" characteristics, many of which may be detrimental to neighboring neurons and oligodendrocytes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alexander Disease", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cytoplasmic Streaming", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hippocampus", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery and Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Guilfoyle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Apr24"}, {"PMID": "23333625", "Title": "Mitochondrial abnormalities in temporal lobe of autistic brain.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of complex developmental disabilities characterized by impaired social interactions, deficits in communication and repetitive behavior. Multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. In postmortem BA21 temporal cortex, a region that exhibits synaptic pathology in ASD, we found that compared to controls, ASD patients exhibited altered protein levels of mitochondria respiratory chain protein complexes, decreased Complex I and IV activities, decreased mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and greater oxidative DNA damage. Mitochondrial membrane mass was higher in ASD brain, as indicated by higher protein levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20, Tim23 and porin. No differences were observed in either mitochondrial DNA or levels of the mitochondrial gene transcription factor TFAM or cofactor PGC1\u03b1, indicating that a mechanism other than alterations in mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial biogenesis underlies these mitochondrial abnormalities. We further identified higher levels of the mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1 and Drp1) and decreased levels of the fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) in ASD patients, indicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in ASD brain. Many of these changes were evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but were less pronounced or absent in adult patients. Together, these findings provide evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox status are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autistic Disorder", "Blotting, Western", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Stress", "Temporal Lobe", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Puri", "Last Name": "Gutierrez Rios", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Han", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasan Orhan", "Last Name": "Akman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gorazd", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Schon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Dimauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}]
