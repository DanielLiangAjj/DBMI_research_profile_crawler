Dauer entry interrupts vulval induction and is associated with a reprogramming-like event that preserves the multipotency of vulval precursor cells (VPCs), allowing vulval development to reinitiate if conditions improve. Vulval induction requires the LIN-3/EGF-like signal from the gonad, which activates EGFR-Ras-ERK signal transduction in the nearest VPC, P6.p. Here, using a biosensor and live imaging we show that EGFR-Ras-ERK activity is downregulated in P6.p in dauers. We investigated this process using gene mutations or transgenes to manipulate different steps of the pathway, and by analyzing LET-23/EGFR subcellular localization during dauer life history. We found that the response to EGF is attenuated at or upstream of Ras activation, and discuss potential membrane-associated mechanisms that could achieve this.

Initially, 4 cells-2 \u03b1 cells and their sisters, the \u03b2 cells-have the potential to be the sole anchor cell. The \u03b2 cells rapidly lose anchor cell potential and invariably become ventral uterine precursor cells, while the 2 \u03b1 cells interact via LIN-12/Notch to resolve which will be the anchor cell and which will become another ventral uterine precursor cell. HLH-2 protein stability is dynamically regulated in cells with anchor cell potential; initially present in all 4 cells, HLH-2 is degraded in presumptive ventral uterine precursor cells while remaining stable in the anchor cell. Here, we demonstrate that stability of HLH-2 protein is regulated by the activity of lin-12/Notch in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells. Our analysis provides evidence that activation of LIN-12 promotes degradation of HLH-2 as part of a negative feedback loop during the anchor cell/ventral uterine precursor cell decision by the \u03b1 cells, and that absence of lin-12 activity in \u03b2 cells increases HLH-2 stability and may account for their propensity to adopt the anchor cell fate in a lin-12 null background. We also performed an RNA interference screen of 232 ubiquitin-related genes and identified 7 genes that contribute to HLH-2 degradation in ventral uterine precursor cells; however, stabilizing HLH-2 by depleting ubiquitin ligases in a lin-12(+) background does not result in supernumerary anchor cells, suggesting that LIN-12 activation does not oppose hlh-2 activity solely by causing HLH-2 protein degradation. Finally, we provide evidence for lin-12-independent transcriptional regulation of hlh-2 in \u03b2 cells that correlates with known differences in POP-1/TCF levels and anchor cell potential between \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells.

Although lox-stop-lox and similar approaches using other site-specific recombinases have been successfully used in many experimental systems, this design has certain limitations.

We demonstrate its efficacy in Caenorhabditis elegans by showing that, when promoters that cause weak and/or transient cell-specific expression are used to drive Cre in combination with a gfp(flexon) transgene, strong and sustained expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is obtained in specific lineages. We also demonstrate its efficacy in an endogenous gene context: we inserted a flexon into the Argonaute gene rde-1 to abrogate RNA interference (RNAi), and restored RNAi tissue specifically by expression of Cre. Finally, we describe several potential additional applications of the Flexon approach, including more precise control of gene expression using intersectional methods, tissue-specific protein degradation, and generation of genetic mosaics.

Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites are somatic females that have a two-armed, U-shaped gonad that connects to the vulva at the midbody. The outgrowth of each gonad arm from the somatic gonad primordium is led by two female distal tip cells (fDTCs), while the anchor cell (AC) remains stationary and central to coordinate uterine and vulval development. The bHLH protein HLH-2 and its dimerization partners LIN-32 and HLH-12 had previously been shown to be required for fDTC specification. Here, we show that ectopic expression of both HLH-12 and LIN-32 in cells with AC potential transiently transforms them into fDTC-like cells. Furthermore, hlh-12 was known to be required for the fDTCs to sustain gonad arm outgrowth. Here, we show that ectopic expression of HLH-12 in the normally stationary AC causes displacement from its normal position and that displacement likely results from activation of the leader program of fDTCs because it requires genes necessary for gonad arm outgrowth. Thus, HLH-12 is both necessary and sufficient to promote gonadal regulatory cell migration. As differences in female gonadal morphology of different nematode species reflect differences in the fate or migratory properties of the fDTCs or of the AC, we hypothesized that evolutionary changes in the expression of hlh-12 may underlie the evolution of such morphological diversity. However, we were unable to identify an hlh-12 ortholog outside of Caenorhabditis. Instead, by performing a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all Class II bHLH proteins in multiple nematode species, we found that hlh-12 evolved within the Caenorhabditis clade, possibly by duplicative transposition of hlh-10.

Signaling from neurons, hypodermis, and intestine regulate the appearance and behavior of dauer larvae and many aspects of developmental arrest of the non-gonadal soma [1, 4, 5].

The inferred signal does not require DAF-2/insulin\u00a0receptor or maintain quiescence of the nearby sex myoblasts, and developmental progression in daf-18(0) does not require dafachronic acids.

However, the efficacy of orthology prediction depends on the accuracy of gene-model predictions, an ongoing process, and orthology-prediction algorithms have also been updated over time. Here we present OrthoList 2 (OL2), a new comparative genomic analysis between C. elegans and humans, and the first assessment of how changes over time affect the landscape of predicted orthologs between two species. Although we find that updates to the orthology-prediction methods significantly changed the landscape of C. elegans-human orthologs predicted by individual programs and-unexpectedly-reduced agreement among them, we also show that our meta-analysis approach \"buffered\" against changes in gene content. We show that adding results from more programs did not lead to many additions to the list and discuss reasons to avoid assigning \"scores\" based on support by individual orthology-prediction programs; the treatment of \"legacy\" genes no longer predicted by these programs; and the practical difficulties of updating due to encountering deprecated, changed, or retired gene identifiers.

The pattern is centered on a cell that adopts the \"1\u00b0\" fate through Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activity, and produces a lateral signal composed of ligands that activate LIN-12/Notch in the two flanking VPCs to cause them to adopt \"2\u00b0\" fate. Here, we investigate orthologs of a transcription complex that acts in mammalian EGFR signaling-lin-1/Elk1, sur-2/Med23, and the Cdk8 Kinase module (CKM)-previously implicated in aspects of 1\u00b0 fate in C. elegans and show they act in different combinations for different processes for 2\u00b0 fate. When EGFR is inactive, the CKM, but not SUR-2, helps to set a threshold for LIN-12/Notch activity in all VPCs. When EGFR is active, all three factors act to resist LIN-12/Notch, as revealed by the reduced ability of ectopically-activated LIN-12/Notch to activate target gene reporters. We show that overcoming this resistance in the 1\u00b0 VPC leads to repression of lateral signal gene reporters, suggesting that resistance to LIN-12/Notch helps ensure that P6.p becomes a robust source of the lateral signal. In addition, we show that sur-2/Med23 and lin-1/Elk1, and not the CKM, are required to promote endocytic downregulation of LIN-12-GFP in the 1\u00b0 VPC. Finally, our analysis using cell fate reporters reveals that both EGFR and LIN-12/Notch signal transduction pathways are active in all VPCs in lin-1/Elk1 mutants, and that lin-1/Elk1 is important for integrating EGFR and lin-12/Notch signaling inputs in the VPCs so that the proper gene complement is transcribed.", "Keywords": ["C. elegans", "CDK-8", "Cdk8", "EGF receptor", "Elk1", "LIN-1", "Med23", "Notch", "SUR-2", "vulva"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8", "ErbB Receptors", "Female", "Genes, Reporter", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Vulva", "ets-Domain Protein Elk-1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan S", "Last Name": "Underwood", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yuting", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Iva", "Last Name": "Greenwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032 isg4@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "28826819", "Title": "A Real-Time Biosensor for ERK Activity Reveals Signaling Dynamics during C.\u00a0elegans Cell Fate Specification.", "Abstract": "Kinase translocation reporters (KTRs) are genetically encoded fluorescent activity sensors that convert kinase activity into a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling equilibrium for visualizing single-cell signaling dynamics.

In C.\u00a0elegans, sexual dimorphism in gonad form and\u00a0function largely originates in different apportionment of roles to three regulatory cells of the\u00a0somatic gonad primordium in young larvae. Their essential roles include leading gonad arm outgrowth, serving as the germline niche, connecting to epithelial openings, and organizing reproductive organ development. The development and function of the regulatory cells in both sexes requires the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor HLH-2, the sole ortholog of the E\u00a0proteins mammalian E2A and Drosophila Daughterless [4-8], yet how they adopt different fates to execute their different roles has been unknown. Here, we show that each regulatory cell expresses a distinct complement of bHLH-encoding genes-and therefore distinct HLH-2:bHLH dimers-and\u00a0formulate a \"bHLH code\" hypothesis for regulatory cell identity. We support this hypothesis by showing that the bHLH gene complement is both necessary and sufficient to confer particular regulatory cell fates. Strikingly, prospective regulatory cells can be directly reprogrammed into other regulatory cell types simply by loss or ectopic expression of bHLH genes, and male-to-female and female-to-male transformations indicate that the code is instructive for sexual dimorphism. The bHLH code appears to be embedded in a bow-tie\u00a0regulatory architecture [9, 10], wherein sexual, positional, temporal, and lineage inputs connect through bHLH genes to diverse outputs for terminal features and provides a plausible mechanism for the evolutionary plasticity of gonad form seen in nematodes [11-15].", "Keywords": ["anchor cell", "bHLH", "cell-fate reprogramming", "cell-fate specification", "distal tip cell", "gonad", "linker cell", "sexual dimorphism"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gonads", "Larva", "Male", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria D", "Last Name": "Sallee", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hana E", "Last Name": "Littleford", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iva", "Last Name": "Greenwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Our analysis has revealed that, while the ubiquitin ligase SEL-10/Fbw7 promotes LIN-12(intra) downregulation in VPCs, there is a distinct mechanism for downregulation of LIN-12(intra) in VPC descendants. Our analysis also revealed that LIN-12(intra) must be in the nuclear complex to be regulated appropriately in VPCs and their descendants, and that the structure or conformation of the carboxy-terminal region influences stability as well.
