However, a circuit-level understanding of how such signals interact to guide navigational behaviour is lacking. Here we characterize a neuronal circuit in the Drosophila central complex that compares internally generated estimates of the heading and goal angles of the fly-both of which are encoded in world-centred (allocentric) coordinates-to generate a body-centred (egocentric) steering signal. Past work has suggested that the activity of EPG neurons represents the fly's moment-to-moment angular orientation, or\u00a0heading angle, during navigation2,11. An animal's moment-to-moment heading angle, however, is not always aligned with its goal angle-that is, the allocentric direction in which it wishes to progress forward. We describe FC2 cells12, a second set of neurons in the Drosophila brain with activity that correlates with the fly's goal angle. Focal optogenetic activation of FC2 neurons induces flies to orient along experimenter-defined directions as they walk forward. EPG and FC2 neurons connect monosynaptically to a third neuronal class, PFL3 cells12,13. We found that individual PFL3 cells show conjunctive, spike-rate tuning to both the heading angle and the goal angle during goal-directed navigation. Informed by the anatomy and physiology of these three cell classes, we develop a model that explains how this circuit compares allocentric heading and goal angles to build an egocentric steering signal in the PFL3 output terminals. Quantitative analyses and optogenetic manipulations of PFL3 activity support the model. Finally, using a new navigational memory task, we show that flies expressing disruptors of synaptic transmission in subsets of PFL3 cells have a reduced ability to orient along arbitrary goal directions, with an effect size in quantitative accordance with the prediction of our model.

Through mathematical analysis, we found that a broad range of biologically relevant learning models (e.g. gradient flow or ridge regression) perform TI successfully and recapitulate signature behavioral patterns long observed in living subjects. First, we found that models with item-wise additive representations automatically encode transitive relations. Second, for more general representations, a single scalar \"conjunctivity factor\" determines model behavior on TI and, further, the principle of norm minimization (a standard statistical inductive bias) enables models with fixed, partly conjunctive representations to generalize transitively. Finally, neural networks in the \"rich regime,\" which enables representation learning and has been found to improve generalization, unexpectedly show poor generalization and anomalous behavior. We find that such networks implement a form of norm minimization (over hidden weights) that yields a local encoding mechanism lacking transitivity.

We investigate whether a sparsely connected recurrent neural network (RNN) can perform classification in a distributed manner without ever bringing all of the relevant information to a single convergence site. Our model is based on a sparse RNN that performs classification dynamically. Specifically, the interconnections of the RNN are trained to resonantly amplify the magnitude of responses to some external inputs but not others. The amplified and non-amplified responses then form the basis for binary classification. Furthermore, the network acts as an evidence accumulator and maintains its decision even after the input is turned off.

Although this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. In this study, we developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings, in a rhesus macaque, even during rapidly changing forces.

The absence of experimental evidence for such large bias currents inspired us to examine an alternative regime that exhibits asynchronous activity without requiring unrealistically large feedforward input. In these networks, irregular spontaneous activity is supported by a continually changing sparse set of neurons. To support this activity, synaptic strengths must be drawn from high-variance distributions. Unlike standard balanced networks, these sparse balance networks exhibit robust nonlinear responses to uniform inputs and non-Gaussian input statistics.

Past work has identified neurons in Drosophila8,11-13 and mammals14 that track the heading angle of an animal referenced to external cues (for example, head direction cells), but this new signal illuminates how the sense of space is properly updated when travelling and heading angles differ (for example, when walking sideways). We then characterize a neuronal circuit that performs an egocentric-to-allocentric (that is, body-centred to world-centred) coordinate transformation and vector addition to compute the allocentric travelling direction. This circuit operates by mapping two-dimensional vectors onto sinusoidal patterns of activity across distinct neuronal populations, with the amplitude of the sinusoid representing the length of the vector and its phase representing the angle of the vector.

One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement, and abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor underlying task implementation.

A temporal latency code represents odor identity in olfactory bulb (OB), but this temporal information is discarded in piriform cortex (PCx) where odor identity is instead encoded through ensemble membership. We developed a spiking PCx network model to understand how this transformation is implemented. In the model, the impact of OB inputs activated earliest after inhalation is amplified within PCx by diffuse recurrent collateral excitation, which then recruits strong, sustained feedback inhibition that suppresses the impact of later-responding glomeruli. We model increasing odor concentrations by decreasing glomerulus onset latencies while preserving their activation sequences. This produces a multiplexed cortical odor code in which activated ensembles are robust to concentration changes while concentration information is encoded through population synchrony.

However, many responses exhibit both regular and irregular components. To address the relationship between tuning curve properties and underlying circuitry, we analyzed neuronal activity recorded from primary motor cortex (M1) of monkeys performing a 3D arm posture control task and compared the results with a neural network model. Posture control is well suited for examining M1 neuronal tuning because it avoids the dynamic complexity of time-varying movements. As a function of hand position, the neuronal responses have a linear component, as has previously been described, as well as heterogeneous and highly irregular nonlinearities. These nonlinear components involve high spatial frequencies and therefore do not support explicit encoding of movement parameters. Yet both the linear and nonlinear components contribute to the decoding of EMG of major muscles used in the task. Remarkably, despite the presence of a strong linear component, a feedforward neural network model with entirely random connectivity can replicate the data, including both the mean and distributions of the linear and nonlinear components as well as several other features of the neuronal responses. This result shows that smoothness provided by the regularity in the inputs to M1 can impose apparent structure on neural responses, in this case a strong linear (also known as cosine) tuning component, even in the absence of ordered synaptic connectivity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arm", "Computational Biology", "Electromyography", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Macaca fascicularis", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Neurons", "Posture", "User-Computer Interface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hagai", "Last Name": "Lalazar", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "L F", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Eilon", "Last Name": "Vaadia", "Affiliation": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26949187", "Title": "Bayesian Sparse Regression Analysis Documents the Diversity of Spinal Inhibitory Interneurons.", "Abstract": "Documenting the extent of cellular diversity is a critical step in defining the functional organization of tissues and organs.

The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different \"multi-spike\" STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Statistical", "Nerve Net", "Neural Inhibition", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Baktash", "Last Name": "Babadi", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "L F", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016Mar"}, {"PMID": "26906501", "Title": "Building functional networks of spiking model neurons.", "Abstract": "Most of the networks used by computer scientists and many of those studied by modelers in neuroscience represent unit activities as continuous variables.

Yet it remains unclear whether activity-dependent refinement has a role in the establishment of connections between sensory afferents and those motor pools that have synergistic biomechanical functions. We show here that genetically abolishing central sensory-motor neurotransmission leads to a selective enhancement in the number and density of such \"heteronymous\" connections, whereas other aspects of sensory-motor connectivity are preserved.

The final system consists of networks that have memorized associations between the sensory data they receive and the commands they issue. These networks are trained on a set of optimal associations generated by minimizing cost functions. Cost function minimization requires predicting the consequences of sequences of commands, which is achieved by constructing forward models, including a model of the lower-level controller. The forward models and cost minimization are used only during training, allowing the trained networks to respond rapidly. In general, the hierarchical approach can be extended to larger numbers of levels, dividing complex tasks into more manageable subtasks. The optimization procedure and the construction of the forward models and controllers can be performed in similar ways at each level of the hierarchy, which allows the system to be modified to perform other tasks or to be extended for more complex tasks without retraining lower-levels.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Net", "Neural Networks, Computer"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Greg", "Last Name": "Wayne", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032-2695, U.S.A. gregwayne@google.com."}, {"First Name": "L F", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2014Oct"}, {"PMID": "24784215", "Title": "Presynaptic inhibition of spinal sensory feedback ensures smooth movement.", "Abstract": "The precision of skilled movement depends on sensory feedback and its refinement by local inhibitory microcircuits. One specialized set of spinal GABAergic interneurons forms axo-axonic contacts with the central terminals of sensory afferents, exerting presynaptic inhibitory control over sensory-motor transmission. The inability to achieve selective access to the GABAergic neurons responsible for this unorthodox inhibitory mechanism has left unresolved the contribution of presynaptic inhibition to motor behaviour. We used Gad2 as a genetic entry point to manipulate the interneurons that contact sensory terminals, and show that activation of these interneurons in mice elicits the defining physiological characteristics of presynaptic inhibition. Selective genetic ablation of Gad2-expressing interneurons severely perturbs goal-directed reaching movements, uncovering a pronounced and stereotypic forelimb motor oscillation, the core features of which are captured by modelling the consequences of sensory feedback at high gain. Our findings define the neural substrate of a genetically hardwired gain control system crucial for the smooth execution of movement.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Efferent Pathways", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Forelimb", "GABAergic Neurons", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Interneurons", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Skills", "Movement", "Neural Inhibition", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Spinal Cord"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J P", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Mortimer B.

AWC olfactory neurons respond to multiple odors with subsecond precision required for chemotaxis, whereas ASH nociceptive neurons integrate noxious cues over several seconds to reach a threshold for avoidance behavior. Each neuron's response to fluctuating stimuli is largely linear and can be described by a biphasic temporal filter and dynamical model. A calcium channel mutation alters temporal filtering and avoidance behaviors initiated by ASH on similar timescales. A sensory G-alpha protein mutation affects temporal filtering in AWC and alters steering behavior in a way that supports an active sensing model for chemotaxis.

We present a complex-valued firing-rate model derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to the linear, quadratic and exponential integrate-and-fire models.

Here we show that each Kenyon cell integrates input from a different and apparently random combination of glomeruli. The glomerular inputs to individual Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning, anatomic features or developmental origins. Moreover, different classes of Kenyon cells do not seem to preferentially integrate inputs from specific combinations of glomeruli.

Its neuronal mechanisms are still unclear despite intensive experimental and theoretical explorations. Most theoretical models of working memory assume both time-invariant neural representations and precise connectivity schemes based on the tuning properties of network neurons. A different, more recent class of models assumes randomly connected neurons that have no tuning to any particular task, and bases task performance purely on adjustment of network readout. Intermediate between these schemes are networks that start out random but are trained by a learning scheme. Experimental studies of a delayed vibrotactile discrimination task indicate that some of the neurons in prefrontal cortex are persistently tuned to the frequency of a remembered stimulus, but the majority exhibit more complex relationships to the stimulus that vary considerably across time. We compare three models, ranging from a highly organized line attractor model to a randomly connected network with chaotic activity, with data recorded during this task. The random network does a surprisingly good job of both performing the task and matching certain aspects of the data. The intermediate model, in which an initially random network is partially trained to perform the working memory task by tuning its recurrent and readout connections, provides a better description, although none of the models matches all features of the data. Our results suggest that prefrontal networks may begin in a random state relative to the task and initially rely on modified readout for task performance. With further training, however, more tuned neurons with less time-varying responses should emerge as the networks become more structured.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Discrimination, Psychological", "Humans", "Memory, Short-Term", "Models, Neurological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Omri", "Last Name": "Barak", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. omri.barak@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sussillo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ranulfo", "Last Name": "Romo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Misha", "Last Name": "Tsodyks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "L F", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Progress in neurobiology", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23436986", "Title": "Pairwise analysis can account for network structures arising from spike-timing dependent plasticity.", "Abstract": "Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies synaptic strengths based on timing information available locally at each synapse.

We study such structures both through simulations and by analyzing the effects of STDP on pair-wise interactions of neurons. We show how conventional STDP acts as a loop-eliminating mechanism and organizes neurons into in- and out-hubs. Loop-elimination increases when depression dominates and turns into loop-generation when potentiation dominates. STDP with a shifted temporal window such that coincident spikes cause depression enhances recurrent connections and functions as a strict buffering mechanism that maintains a roughly constant average firing rate. STDP with the opposite temporal shift functions as a loop eliminator at low rates and as a potent loop generator at higher rates.
