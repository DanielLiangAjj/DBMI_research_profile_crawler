Yet, perfusion patterns and their relationship to inflammation are unknown pre-ARDS. We aimed to assess perfusion/density ratios and spatial perfusion-density distributions and associate these to lung inflammation, during early lung injury in large animals at different physiological conditions caused by different systemic inflammation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels. Sheep were protectively ventilated (16-24 h) and imaged for lung density, pulmonary capillary perfusion (13Nitrogen-saline), and inflammation (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) using positron emission and computed tomography. We studied four conditions: permissive atelectasis (PEEP = 0 cmH2O); and ARDSNet low-stretch PEEP-setting strategy with supine moderate or mild endotoxemia, and prone mild endotoxemia. Perfusion/density heterogeneity increased pre-ARDS in all groups. Perfusion redistribution to density depended on ventilation strategy and endotoxemia level, producing more atelectasis in mild than moderate endotoxemia (P = 0.010) with the oxygenation-based PEEP-setting strategy. The spatial distribution of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was related to local Q/D (P < 0.001 for Q/D group interaction). Moderate endotoxemia yielded markedly low/zero perfusion in normal-low density lung, with 13Nitrogen-saline perfusion indicating nondependent capillary obliteration. Prone animals' perfusion was remarkably homogeneously distributed with density. Lung perfusion redistributes heterogeneously to density during pre-ARDS protective ventilation in animals. This is associated with increased inflammation, nondependent capillary obliteration, and lung derecruitment susceptibility depending on endotoxemia level and ventilation strategy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Perfusion redistribution does not follow lung density redistribution in the first 16-24 h of systemic endotoxemia and protective tidal volume mechanical ventilation. The same oxygenation-based positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-setting strategy can lead at different endotoxemia levels to different perfusion redistributions, PEEP values, and lung aerations, worsening lung biomechanical conditions.

Studies using pharmacologic approaches or genetic animal models pertinent to extracellular adenosine signaling implicate this pathway in attenuating hypoxia-associated inflammation. There are four distinct adenosine receptors. Of these, it is not surprising that the Adora2b adenosine receptor functions as an endogenous feedback loop to control hypoxia-associated inflammation. First, Adora2b activation requires higher adenosine concentrations compared to other adenosine receptors, similar to those achieved during hypoxic inflammation. Second, Adora2b is transcriptionally induced during hypoxia or inflammation by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A. Studies seeking an alternative adenosine receptor activation mechanism have linked netrin-1 with Adora2b. Netrin-1 was originally discovered as a neuronal guidance molecule but also functions as an immune-modulatory signaling molecule. Similar to Adora2b, netrin-1 is induced by HIF1A, and has been shown to enhance Adora2b signaling.

We assessed the regional proteomics of atelectatic versus normally-aerated lung tissue to test the hypothesis that immune and alveolar-capillary barrier functions are compromised by purely atelectasis and dysregulated by additional systemic inflammation (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Without LPS, 130 proteins were differentially abundant in atelectasis versus aerated lung, mostly (n\u2009=\u2009126) with less abundance together with negatively enriched processes in immune, endothelial and epithelial function, and Hippo signaling pathway. Instead, LPS-exposed atelectasis produced 174 differentially abundant proteins, mostly (n\u2009=\u2009108) increased including acute lung injury marker RAGE and chemokine CCL5. Functional analysis indicated enhanced leukocyte processes and negatively enriched cell-matrix adhesion and cell junction assembly with LPS. Additionally, extracellular matrix organization and TGF-\u03b2 signaling were negatively enriched in atelectasis with decreased adhesive glycoprotein THBS1 regardless of LPS. Concordance of a subset of transcriptomics and proteomics revealed overlap of leukocyte-related gene-protein pairs and processes. Together, proteomics of exclusively atelectasis indicates decreased immune response, which converts into an increased response with LPS. Alveolar-capillary barrier function-related proteomics response is down-regulated in atelectasis irrespective of LPS.

Total lung strain (LSTOTAL) has a dynamic (LSDYNAMIC) and a static (LSSTATIC) component. Due to lung heterogeneity, global lung strain may not accurately represent regional total tissue lung strain (TSTOTAL), which may also be described by a regional dynamic (TSDYNAMIC) and static (TSSTATIC) component. Six healthy anesthetized beagles (12.4 \u00b1 1.4 kg body weight) were placed in dorsal recumbency and ventilated with a tidal volume of 15 ml/kg, respiratory rate of 15 bpm, and zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP). Respiratory system mechanics and full thoracic end-expiratory and end-inspiratory CT scan images were obtained at ZEEP. Thereafter, a PEEP of 5 cmH2O was set and respiratory system mechanics measurements and end-expiratory and end-inspiratory images were repeated. Computed lung volumes from CT scans were used to evaluate the global LSTOTAL, LSDYNAMIC, and LSSTATIC during PEEP. During ZEEP, LSSTATIC was assumed zero; therefore, LSTOTAL was the same as LSDYNAMIC. Image segmentation was applied to CT images to obtain maps of regional TSTOTAL, TSDYNAMIC, and TSSTATIC during PEEP, and TSDYNAMIC during ZEEP. Compliance increased (p = 0.013) and driving pressure decreased (p = 0.043) during PEEP. PEEP increased the end-expiratory lung volume (p < 0.001) and significantly reduced global LSDYNAMIC (33.4 \u00b1 6.4% during ZEEP, 24.0 \u00b1 4.6% during PEEP, p = 0.032). LSSTATIC by PEEP was larger than the reduction in LSDYNAMIC; therefore, LSTOTAL at PEEP was larger than LSDYNAMIC at ZEEP (p = 0.005). There was marked topographic heterogeneity of regional strains. PEEP induced a significant reduction in TSDYNAMIC in all lung regions (p < 0.05). Similar to global findings, PEEP-induced TSSTATIC was larger than the reduction in TSDYNAMIC; therefore, PEEP-induced TSTOTAL was larger than TSDYNAMIC at ZEEP. In conclusion, PEEP reduced both global and regional estimates of dynamic strain, but induced a large static strain. Given that lung injury has been mostly associated with tidal deformation, limiting dynamic strain may be an important clinical target in healthy and diseased lungs, but this requires further study.",

Pulmonary atelectasis can cause various degrees of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during and after surgery. In its most serious presentations, lung collapse could contribute to postoperative respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, and worse overall clinical outcomes. A specific risk assessment is critical to allow clinicians to optimally choose the anesthetic technique, prepare appropriate monitoring, adapt the perioperative plan, and ensure the patient's safety. Bedside diagnosis and management have benefited from recent imaging advancements such as lung ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography, and monitoring such as esophageal manometry. Therapeutic management includes a broad range of interventions aimed at promoting lung recruitment. During general anesthesia, these strategies have consistently demonstrated their effectiveness in improving intraoperative oxygenation and respiratory compliance. Yet these same intraoperative strategies may fail to affect additional postoperative pulmonary outcomes. Specific attention to the postoperative period may be key for such outcome impact of lung expansion. Interventions such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilatory support may be beneficial in specific patients at high risk for pulmonary atelectasis (e.g., obese) or those with clinical presentations consistent with lung collapse (e.g., postoperative hypoxemia after abdominal and cardiothoracic surgeries). Preoperative interventions may open new opportunities to minimize perioperative lung collapse and prevent pulmonary complications.

treatment outcomes in lung diseases that interfere with gas exchange through alterations of the pulmonary parenchyma, airways, or vasculature. To date, however, there are no widely accepted standard acquisition protocols or imaging data analysis methods for pulmonary 18F-FDG PET/CT in these diseases, resulting in disparate approaches. Hence, comparison of data across the literature is challenging. To help harmonize the acquisition and analysis and promote reproducibility, we collated details of acquisition protocols and analysis methods from 7 PET centers. From this information and our discussions, we reached the consensus recommendations given here on patient preparation, choice of dynamic versus static imaging, image reconstruction, and image analysis

Survival in Experimental Mechanical Ventilation.", "Abstract": "Low-tidal volume (Vt) ventilation might protect healthy lungs from volutrauma but lead to inflammation resulting from other mechanisms, namely alveolar derecruitment and the ensuing alveolar collapse and tidal reexpansion. We hypothesized that the different mechanisms of low- and high-volume injury would be reflected in different mechanical properties being associated with development of pulmonary inflammation and mortality: an increase of hysteresis, reflecting progressive alveolar derecruitment, at low Vt; an increase of elastance, as a result of overdistension, at higher Vt. Mice were allocated to \"protective\" (6 ml/kg) or \"injurious\" (15-20 ml/kg) Vt groups and ventilated for 16 hours or until death. We measured elastance and hysteresis; pulmonary IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein 2); wet-to-dry ratio; and blood gases. Survival was greater in the protective group (60%) than in the injurious group (25%). Nonsurvivors showed increased pulmonary cytokines, particularly in the injurious group, with the increase of elastance reflecting IL-6 concentration. Survivors instead showed only modest increases of cytokines, independent of Vt and unrelated to the increase of elastance. No single lung strain threshold could discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors. Hysteresis increased faster in the protective group, but, contrary to our hypothesis, its change was inversely related to the concentration of cytokines. In this model, significant mortality associated with pulmonary inflammation occurred even for strain values as low as about 0.8. Low Vt improved survival. The accompanying increase of hysteresis was not associated with greater inflammation.", "Keywords": ["acute lung injury", "artificial respiration", "respiratory mechanics", "ventilator-induced lung injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Pneumonia", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Respiratory Mechanics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margit V", "Last Name": "Szabari", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kazue", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Radiology."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Joseph J", "Last Name": "Locascio", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Edward A", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Marcos F", "Last Name": "Vidal Melo", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Guido", "Last Name": "Musch", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2019Feb"}, {"PMID": "30139899", "Title": "International multicenter observational study on assessment of ventilatory management during general anaesthesia for robotic surgery and its effects on postoperative pulmonary complication (AVATaR): study protocol and statistical analysis plan.", "Abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has emerged as an alternative minimally invasive surgical option.

However, imaging estimates of volumetric tidal strain (\u03b5 = regional tidal volume/reference volume) present substantial conceptual differences in reference volume computation and consideration of tidally recruited lung. We compared current and new methods to estimate tidal volumetric strains with computed tomography, and quantified the effect of tidal volume (VT) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on strain estimates. Eight supine pigs were ventilated with VT = 6 and 12 ml/kg and PEEP = 0, 6, and 12 cmH2O. End-expiratory and end-inspiratory scans were analyzed in eight regions of interest along the ventral-dorsal axis. Regional reference volumes were computed at end-expiration (with/without correction of regional VT for intratidal recruitment) and at resting lung volume (PEEP = 0) corrected for intratidal and PEEP-derived recruitment. All strain estimates demonstrated vertical heterogeneity with the largest tidal strains in middependent regions (P < 0.01). Maximal strains for distinct estimates occurred at different lung regions and were differently affected by VT-PEEP conditions. Values consistent with lung injury and inflammation were reached regionally, even when global measurements were below critical levels. Strains increased with VT and were larger in middependent than in nondependent lung regions. PEEP reduced tidal-strain estimates referenced to end-expiratory lung volumes, although it did not affect strains referenced to resting lung volume. These estimates of tidal strains in normal lungs point to middependent lung regions as those at risk for ventilator-induced lung injury.

Obesity poses particular challenges to adequate mechanical ventilation in addition to surgical constraints, primarily by restricted lung mechanics due to excessive adiposity, frequent respiratory comorbidities (i.e. sleep apnea, asthma), and concerns of postoperative respiratory depression and other pulmonary complications. The number of surgical patients with obesity is increasing, and facing these challenges is common in the operating rooms and critical care units worldwide. In this review we summarize the existing literature which supports the following recommendations for the perioperative ventilation in obese patients: (1) the use of protective ventilation with low tidal volumes (approximately 8 mL/kg, calculated based on predicted -not actual- body weight) to avoid volutrauma; (2) a focus on lung recruitment by utilizing PEEP (8-15 cmH2O) in addition to recruitment maneuvers during the intraoperative period, as well as incentivized deep breathing and noninvasive ventilation early in the postoperative period, to avoid atelectasis, hypoxemia and atelectrauma; and (3) a judicious oxygen use (ideally less than 0.8) to avoid hypoxemia but also possible reabsorption atelectasis. Obesity poses an additional challenge for achieving adequate protective ventilation during one-lung ventilation, but different lung isolation techniques have been adequately performed in obese patients by experienced providers. Postoperative efforts should be directed to avoid hypoventilation, atelectasis and hypoxemia. Further studies are needed to better define optimum protective ventilation strategies and analyze their impact on the perioperative outcomes of surgical patients with obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Obesity", "One-Lung Ventilation", "Oxygen", "Perioperative Care", "Positive-Pressure Respiration", "Postoperative Complications", "Respiration, Artificial", "Tidal Volume"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ana", "Last Name": "Fernandez-Bustamante", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado SOM, Aurora, CO, USA.
