Machine learning models are shown to be useful for early detection, however training such models suffers from small sample sizes due to rarity of the condition. Here we propose a Federated Learning approach to train a DCI classifier across three institutions to overcome challenges of sharing data across hospitals. We developed a framework for federated feature selection and built a federated ensemble classifier. We compared the performance of FL model to that obtained by training separate models at each site. FL significantly improved performance at only two sites. We found that this was due to feature distribution differences across sites. FL improves performance in sites with similar feature distributions, however, FL can worsen performance in sites with heterogeneous distributions.

CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown. By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively. Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients [ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006], but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz [odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9] and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection.

The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for automatically identifying segments of intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform data from external ventricular drainage (EVD) recordings during intermittent drainage and closure.Methods. The proposed method uses time-frequency analysis through wavelets to distinguish periods of ICP waveform in EVD data. By comparing the frequency compositions of the ICP signals (when the EVD system is clamped) and the artifacts (when the system is open), the algorithm can detect short, uninterrupted segments of ICP waveform from the longer periods of non-measurement data. The method involves applying a wavelet transform, calculating the absolute power in a specific range, using Otsu thresholding to automatically identify a threshold, and performing a morphological operation to remove small segments. Two investigators manually graded the same randomly selected one-hour segments of the resulting processed data. Performance metrics were calculated as a percentage.Results. The study analyzed data from 229 patients who had EVD placed following subarachnoid hemorrhage between June 2006 and December 2012. Of these, 155 (67.7%) were female and 62 (27%) developed delayed cerebral ischemia. A total of 45 150 h of data were segmented. 2044 one-hour segments were randomly selected and evaluated by two investigators (MM and DN). Of those, the evaluators agreed on the classification of 1556 one-hour segments. The algorithm was able to correctly identify 86% (1338 h) of ICP waveform data. 8.2% (128 h) of the time the algorithm either partially or fully failed to segment the ICP waveform. 5.4% (84 h) of data, artifacts were mistakenly identified as ICP waveforms (false positives).Conclusion. The proposed algorithm automates the identification of valid ICP waveform segments of waveform in EVD data and thus enables the inclusion in real-time data analysis for decision support.

We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]).

In addition, plasma thrombin and plasmin generation are elevated and reduced, respectively, with increasing age and also with increasing body mass index (BMI). The severity risk of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases in adults older than 65 and in individuals with certain pre-existing health conditions, including obesity (>30 kg/m2). The present cross-sectional study focused on an analysis of the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, including measurements of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (VWF:AG), VWF collagen binding activity (VWF:CBA), Factor VIII antigen, ADAMTS13 antigen, and ADAMTS13 activity, in addition to thrombin and plasmin generation potential, in a demographically diverse population of COVID-19 negative (-) (n = 288) and COVID-19 positive (+) (n = 543) patient plasmas collected at the time of hospital presentation. Data were analyzed as a whole, and then after dividing patients by age (<65 and \u226565) and independently by BMI [<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, >30 (kg/m2)]. These analyses suggest that VWF parameters (i.e., the VWF/ADAMTS13 activity ratio) and thrombin and plasmin generation differed in COVID-19 (+), as compared to COVID-19 (-) patient plasma. Further, age (\u226565) more than BMI contributed to aberrant plasma indicators of endothelial coagulopathy. Based on these findings, evaluating both the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, along with thrombin and plasmin generation, could provide insight into the extent of endothelial dysfunction as well as the plasmatic imbalance in coagulation and fibrinolysis potential, particularly for at-risk patient populations.", "Keywords": ["ADAMTS13", "COVID-19", "plasmin", "thrombin", "von Willebrand factor"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kiruphagaran", "Last Name": "Thangaraju", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Katneni", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Imo J", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Saini", "Last Name": "Setua", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver -

We describe our recent studies investigating the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 crisis in New York City in spring 2020. Using rotational thombelastometry we found that almost all patients with severe COVID-19 had signs of hypercoagulability compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Specifically, the maximal clot firmness in the fibrin-based extrinsically activated test was almost twice the upper limit of normal in COVID patients, indicating a fibrin-mediated cause for hypercoagulability. To better understand the mechanism of this hypercoagulability we measured the components of the fibrinolytic pathways. Fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, but not plasminogen levels were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Our studies indicate that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 may be because of decreased fibrinolysis resulting from inhibition of plasmin through high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Clinicians creating treatment protocols for anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients should consider these potential mechanisms of hypercoaguability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

The present large study sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n = 831) that tested positive (n = 543) or negative (n = 288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on plasma from acutely ill patients collected while in the emergency department, at admission, or during hospitalization. Lipidomics analyses were also performed on COVID-19-positive or -negative subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index (n = 60/group). Significant changes in amino acid and fatty acid/acylcarnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression, and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half, yielding ~78% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for mechanistic follow-up studies and data sharing opportunities, which

Exploratory studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection on the plasma metabolome have been performed, often with small numbers of patients, and with or without relevant control data; however, determining the impact of biological and clinical variables remains critical to understanding potential markers of disease severity and progression. The present large study, including relevant controls, sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n\u2009=\u2009831), testing positive (n\u2009=\u2009543) or negative (n\u2009=\u2009288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on 831 plasma samples from acutely ill patients while in the emergency department, at admission, and during hospitalization. We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding\u2009~\u200978% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Imo", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Cendali", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Fabia", "Last Name": "Gamboni", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Kiruphagaran", "Last Name": "Thangaraju", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Katneni", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Stacie", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Valk", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Eldad", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2021May10"}, {"PMID": "33685002", "Title": "Can We Utilize Whole Blood Viscoelastic Coagulation Assays to Better Identify and Treat Coagulopathy in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Coagulation", "Blood Coagulation Disorders", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Yoh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Sisti", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany R", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise.

The aims of this study are to derive and internally validate a fully automated segmentation algorithm for volumetric analysis of PHE. Methods- Inpatient computed tomography scans of 400 consecutive adults with spontaneous, supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage enrolled in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project (2009-2018) were separated into training (n=360) and test (n=40) datasets. A fully automated segmentation algorithm was derived from manual segmentations in the training dataset using convolutional neural networks, and its performance was compared with that of manual and semiautomated segmentation methods in the test dataset. Results- The mean volumetric dice similarity coefficients for the fully automated segmentation algorithm were 0.838\u00b10.294 and 0.843\u00b10.293 with manual and semiautomated segmentation methods as reference standards, respectively.

We sought to investigate whether subclinical liver disease, specifically liver fibrosis, is associated with clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods- We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Intracerebral Hemorrhage. We included adult patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset. We calculated 3 validated fibrosis indices-Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4 score, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score-and modeled them as continuous exposure variables. Primary outcomes were admission hematoma volume and hematoma expansion. Secondary outcomes were mortality, and the composite of major disability or death, at 90 days. We used linear and logistic regression models adjusted for previously established risk factors. Results- Among 432 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, the mean Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score values on admission reflected intermediate probabilities of fibrosis, whereas standard hepatic assays and coagulation parameters were largely normal. After adjusting for potential confounders, Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index was associated with hematoma volume (\u03b2, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.04-0.36]), hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.3]), and mortality (odds ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]).

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score was not associated with any outcome. Indices were not associated with the composite of major disability or death.

Given the paucity of data on the relationship between antiplatelet therapy after ICH and functional outcomes, we aimed to study this association in a multicenter cohort. Methods- We meta-analyzed data from (1) the Massachusetts General Hospital ICH registry (n=1854), (2) the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database (n=762), and (3) the Yale stroke registry (n=185). Our exposure was antiplatelet therapy after ICH, which was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and a composite of major disability or death (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6). We used Cox proportional regression analyses to estimate the hazard ratio of death or poor functional outcome as a function of antiplatelet therapy and random-effects meta-analysis to pool the estimated HRs across studies. Additional analyses stratified by hematoma location (lobar and deep ICH) were performed. Results- We included a total of 2801 ICH patients, of whom 288 (10.3%) were started on antiplatelet medications after ICH. Median times to antiplatelet therapy ranged from 7 to 39 days.

Some of these systems monitor cell lineages spatially and/or temporally without regard to gene expression by the cells, whereas others correlate gene expression with the lineage under study. The GAL4 Technique for Real-time and Clonal Expression (G-TRACE) system allows for rapid, fluorescent protein-based visualization of both current and past GAL4 expression patterns and is therefore amenable to genome-wide expression-based lineage screens. Here we describe the results from such a screen, performed by undergraduate students of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Undergraduate Research Consortium for Functional Genomics (URCFG) and high school summer scholars as part of a discovery-based education program. The results of the screen, which reveal novel expression-based lineage patterns within the brain, the imaginal disc epithelia, and the hematopoietic lymph gland, have been compiled into the G-TRACE Expression Database (GED), an online resource for use by the Drosophila research community. The impact of this discovery-based research experience on student learning gains was assessed independently and shown to be greater than that of similar programs conducted elsewhere. Furthermore, students participating in the URCFG showed considerably higher STEM retention rates than UCLA STEM students that did not participate in the URCFG, as well as STEM students nationwide.",

"Title": "Hyperemia in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients is associated with an increased risk of seizures.", "Abstract": "The association between impaired brain perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity status and the risk of ictal events in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage is unknown. We identified 13 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients with seizures and 22 with ictal-interictal continuum (IIC), and compared multimodality physiological recordings to 38 similarly poor-grade SAH patients without ictal activity. We analyzed 10,179 cumulative minutes of seizure and 12,762 cumulative minutes of IIC. Cerebrovascular reactivity (PRx) was not different between subjects with seizures, IIC, or controls. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was higher in patients with seizures [99\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5, p\u2009=\u2009.005] and IIC [97\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5, p\u2009=\u2009.007] when compared to controls [89\u2009\u00b1\u200912.3].

From 158 intracerebral hemorrhage patients that underwent MRI, one third was unconscious at the time of MRI and half of these patients recovered consciousness by ICU discharge. Deep structural lesions predicted both, impairment and recovery of consciousness, together with established measures of mass effect. Lesions in the midbrain peduncle and pontine tegmentum alongside the caudate nucleus were implicated as critical structures. Unconscious patients predicted to recover consciousness by ICU discharge had better long-term functional outcomes than those predicted to remain unconscious.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Brain", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cohort Studies", "Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic", "Consciousness", "Female", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stroke", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Rohaut", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Critical Care Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin W", "Last Name": "Doyle", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Critical Care Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra S", "Last Name": "Reynolds", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Critical Care Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kay", "Last Name": "Igwe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute, Gertrude H.

We describe a medically-refractory case of CVST in a 35-year-old woman later found to have JAK2 mutation and essential thrombocytosis. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Forty-hours of continuous-tPA in addition to systemic intravenous-heparin led to complete radiographic and clinical resolution of CVST. Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially.

The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome. METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up. RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment.

SBI is often subclinical, but can be detected through physiologic changes. These changes serve as a surrogate for tissue injury/cell death and are captured by parameters measured by various monitors that measure intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2), cerebral metabolism, and electrocortical activity. In the ideal setting, multimodality monitoring (MMM) integrates these neurological monitoring parameters with traditional hemodynamic monitoring and the physical exam, presenting the information needed to clinicians who can intervene before irreversible damage occurs. There are now consensus guidelines on the utilization of MMM, and there continue to be new advances and questions regarding its use. In this review, we examine these recommendations, recent evidence for MMM, and future directions for MMM.", "Keywords": ["Brain metabolism", "Brain tissue oxygenation", "Cerebral blood flow", "Intracranial pressure", "Microdialysis", "Multimodal monitoring"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Brain Diseases", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Humans", "Intracranial Pressure", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Multimodal Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurocritical Care, Columbia University, 177 Fort Washington Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurocritical Care, Columbia University, 177 Fort Washington Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA. sp3291@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Current neurology and neuroscience reports", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}, {"PMID": "26992857", "Title": "Global cerebral edema from hypercapnic respiratory acidosis and response to hyperosmolar therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acidosis, Respiratory", "Adult", "Brain Edema", "Humans", "Hypercapnia", "Male", "Osmolar Concentration", "Sodium Chloride"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY. dr2753@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alexander E", "Last Name": "Merkler", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2016Apr19"}, {"PMID": "26905914", "Title": "Unexpected Rapid Improvement and Neurogenic Stunned Myocardium in a Patient With Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy: A Case Report and Literature Review.", "Abstract": "Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy-type Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) is a subset of GBS with either a rapidly improving or protracted course that was first described in China. We describe a 27-year-old previously healthy woman with weakness that progressed to complete tetraplegia and areflexia within 2 weeks after an upper respiratory illness. A lumbar puncture performed 4 days after onset of neurologic symptoms was inconclusive for GBS, and electromyography revealed complete motor axonal neuropathy. The patient had Mycoplasma pneumoniae in her nares and blood, and several antiganglioside antibodies in her blood. She was treated with plasmapheresis, antibiotics, and physical therapy. Her motor function and reflexes improved rapidly with treatment, and she was able to ambulate within 3 weeks. She also experienced cardiomyopathy, which improved with plasmapheresis. We report a rare case of Mycoplasma pneumonia-associated acute motor axonal neuropathy-type GBS presenting with complete tetraplegia, areflexia, and neurogenic stunned myocardium that rapidly improved with plasmapheresis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Female", "Guillain-Barre Syndrome", "Humans", "Myocardial Stunning", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Plasmapheresis", "Recovery of Function"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Magid-Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander E", "Last Name": "Merkler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sweta", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Teresa L", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical neuromuscular disease", "PubDate": "2016Mar"}, {"PMID": "23580250", "Title": "Reversible severe encephalitis and word deafness following rapid immune reconstitution in AIDS: a case report.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Acute Disease", "Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Deafness", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Encephalitis, Viral", "Female", "Humans", "Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome", "Recovery of Function"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Clinical Research Building, 1120 NW 14 Street, Suite 1317, Miami, FL 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie D", "Last Name": "Glenn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol K", "Last Name": "Petito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Judith Donovan", "Last Name": "Post", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashok", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurovirology", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}]
