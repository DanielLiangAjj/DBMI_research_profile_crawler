Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling recruited PWM providers via email to complete a 23-question survey with multiple choice and open-ended questions. Analyses include descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, and qualitative analysis. Results: Of the 55 respondents, 80% reported ordering genetic testing. Respondents were primarily physicians (82.8%) in practice for 11-20 years (42%), identified as female (80%), White (76.4%), and non-Hispanic (92.7%) and provided PWM care 1-4 half day sessions per week. Frequently reported patient characteristics that prompted testing did not vary by provider years of experience (YOE). These included obesity onset before age 6, hyperphagia, dysmorphic facies, and developmental delays. The number of patient characteristics that prompted testing varied by YOE (p\u2009=\u20090.03); respondents with 6-10 YOE indicated more patient characteristics than respondents with >20 YOE (mean 10.3 vs. mean 6.2). The reported primary benefit of testing was health information for patients/families; the primary drawback was the high number of indeterminate tests. Ethical concerns expressed were fear of increasing weight stigma, discrimination, and impact on insurance coverage. Respondents (42%) desired training and guidance on interpreting results and counseling patients and families. Conclusions: Most PWM providers reported genetic testing as an option for patient management. Provider training in genetics/genomics and research into provider and family attitudes on the genetics of obesity and the value of genetic testing are next steps to consider.", "Keywords": ["genetic testing", "genomic medicine", "pediatric weight management, precision medicine", "providers"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karyn J", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, College of Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Chaves", "Affiliation": "Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo J", "Last Name": "Ariza", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vidhu V", "Last Name": "Thaker", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chi C", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, College of Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen J", "Last Name": "Binns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Journal": "Childhood obesity (Print)", "PubDate": "2024Jan08"}, {"PMID": "37962326", "Title": "Metabolite signature of diabetes remission in individuals with obesity undergoing weight loss interventions.", "Abstract": "This observational study investigated metabolomic changes in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after weight loss.

The rising prevalence of obesity has been attributed, in part, to environmental factors including the globalization of the western diet and unhealthy lifestyle choices. In this review we argue that how and when such exposures come into play from conception significantly impact overall risk of obesity and later health outcomes. While the laws of thermodynamics dictate that obesity is caused by an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, the drivers of each of these may be laid down before the manifestation of the phenotype. We present evidence over the last half-century that suggests that the temporospatial evolution of obesity from intrauterine life and beyond is, in part, due to the conditioning of physiological processes at critical developmental periods that results in maladaptive responses to obesogenic exposures later in life. We begin the review by introducing studies that describe an association between perinatal factors and later risk of obesity. After a brief discussion of the pathogenesis of obesity, including the systemic regulation of appetite, adiposity, and basal metabolic rate, we delve into the mechanics of how intrauterine, postnatal and early childhood metabolic environments may contribute to adult obesity risk through the process of metabolic conditioning.

The discovery of the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 and its RNA-guided cleavage mechanism marked the beginning of a new era in genomic engineering by enabling the editing of a target region in the genome. Gene-edited cells or mice can be used as models for understanding human diseases. Given its high impact in functional genomic experiments on different model systems, several CRISPR/Cas9 protocols have been generated in the past years. The technique uses a straightforward \"cut and stitch\" mechanism, but requires an accurate step-by-step design. One of the key points is the use of an efficient programmable guide RNA to increase the rate of success in obtaining gene-specific edited clones. Here, we describe an efficient editing protocol using a ribonucleotide protein (RNP) complex for homology-directed repair (HDR)-based correction of a point mutation in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line generated from a 14-year-old patient with severe early-onset obesity carrying a de novo variant of ARNT2. The resulting isogenic iPSC line, named CUIMCi003-A-1, has a normal karyotype, expresses stemness markers, and can be differentiated into progenies from all three germ layers. We provide a detailed workflow for designing a single guide RNA and donor DNA, and for isolating clonal human iPSCs edited with the desired modification.

"Heterogeneous populations of hypothalamic neurons orchestrate energy balance via the release of specific signatures of neuropeptides. However, how specific intracellular machinery controls peptidergic identities and function of individual hypothalamic neurons remains largely unknown. The transcription factor T-box 3 (Tbx3) is expressed in hypothalamic neurons sensing and governing energy status, whereas human TBX3 haploinsufficiency has been linked with obesity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Tbx3 function in hypothalamic neurons causes weight gain and other metabolic disturbances by disrupting both the peptidergic identity and plasticity of Pomc/Cart and Agrp/Npy neurons. These alterations are observed after loss of Tbx3 in both immature hypothalamic neurons and terminally differentiated mouse neurons. We further establish the importance of Tbx3 for body weight regulation in Drosophila melanogaster and show that TBX3 is implicated in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hypothalamic Pomc neurons. Our data indicate that Tbx3 directs the terminal specification of neurons as functional components of the melanocortin system and is required for maintaining their peptidergic identity. In summary, we report the discovery of a key mechanistic process underlying the functional heterogeneity of hypothalamic neurons governing body weight and systemic metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Agouti-Related Protein", "Animals", "Body Weight", "Energy Metabolism", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Hypothalamus", "Melanocortins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Pro-Opiomelanocortin", "RNA, Messenger", "T-Box Domain Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carmelo", "Last Name": "Quarta", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Fisette", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yanjun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gustav", "Last Name": "Colld\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Beata", "Last Name": "Legutko", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Ting", "Last Name": "Tseng", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC), Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Reim", "Affiliation": "Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Wierer", "Affiliation": "Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Maria Caterina", "Last Name": "De Rosa", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Klaus", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Rick", "Last Name": "Rausch", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vidhu V", "Last Name": "Thaker", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Graf", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tim M", "Last Name": "Strom", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Laure", "Last Name": "Poher", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Gruber", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Oph\u00e9lia", "Last Name": "Le Thuc", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Cebrian-Serrano", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Dhiraj", "Last Name": "Kabra", "Affiliation": "Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Bellocchio", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1215, NeuroCentre Magendie, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Stephen C", "Last Name": "Woods", "Affiliation": "University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, Metabolic Diseases Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gert O", "Last Name": "Pflugfelder", "Affiliation": "Institute of Developmental and Neurobiology.

Infants exposed to excess iodine are at risk of developing hypothyroidism, especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), because they are routinely exposed to excess iodine from intravenous iodinated contrast media and topical antiseptics. The aim of the present study was to identify the proportion of neonates with CHD exposed to iodine who developed hypothyroidism and to identify the associated risk factors. This was a retrospective study of neonates undergoing cardiac catheterization at Boston Children's Hospital during a 3-year period, some of whom also underwent cardiac surgery. Hypothyroidism was defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level (>20 mIU/L at 24 to 96 hours of age and >15 mIU/L at >96 hours of age by heel-stick sampling and >9.1 mIU/L at 1 to 20 weeks of age by serum testing). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to predict the odds of developing hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed incidentally in 46 of 183 infants (25%) with CHD after iodine exposure. Controlling for baseline cardiac risk, postnatal age, and gestational age, we found a fourfold increase in odds of developing hypothyroidism in neonates with serum creatinine >0.9 mg/dL and a fourfold increase in those who underwent more than three procedures. Hypothyroidism in neonates with CHD exposed to excess iodine is associated with multiple procedures and impaired renal function. Routine serial monitoring of thyroid function in these neonates is warranted.

The prevalence of severe obesity in children has doubled in the past decade. The objective of this study is to identify the clinical documentation of obesity in young children with a BMI \u2265 99th percentile at two large tertiary care pediatric hospitals. Methods. We used a standardized algorithm utilizing data from electronic health records to identify children with severe early onset obesity (BMI \u2265 99th percentile at age <6 years). We extracted descriptive terms and ICD-9 codes to evaluate documentation of obesity at Boston Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center between 2007 and 2014. Results. A total of 9887 visit records of 2588 children with severe early onset obesity were identified. Based on predefined criteria for documentation of obesity, 21.5% of children (13.5% of visits) had positive documentation, which varied by institution. Documentation in children first seen under 2 years of age was lower than in older children (15% versus 26%). Documentation was significantly higher in girls (29% versus 17%, p < 0.001), African American children (27% versus 19% in whites, p < 0.001), and the obesity focused specialty clinics (70% versus 15% in primary care and 9% in other subspecialty clinics, p < 0.001).

The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child's age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenneth C", "Last Name": "Copeland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Silverstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly R", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Greg E", "Last Name": "Prazar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terry", "Last Name": "Raymer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard N", "Last Name": "Shiffman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shelley C", "Last Name": "Springer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vidhu V", "Last Name": "Thaker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meaghan", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan K", "Last Name": "Flinn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Academy of Pediatrics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Pediatrics", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
