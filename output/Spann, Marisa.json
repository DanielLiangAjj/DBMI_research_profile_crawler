Despite progress, our understanding of the developmental trajectories of the connectome in the perinatal period remains incomplete. Brain age prediction uses machine learning to estimate the brain's maturity relative to normative data. The difference between the individual's predicted and chronological age-or brain age gap (BAG)-represents the deviation from these normative trajectories. Here, we assess brain age prediction and BAGs using structural and functional connectomes for infants in the first month of life. We used resting-state fMRI and DTI data from 611 infants (174 preterm; 437 term) from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) and connectome-based predictive modeling to predict postmenstrual age (PMA). Structural and functional connectomes accurately predicted PMA for term and preterm infants. Predicted ages from each modality were correlated. At the network level, nearly all canonical brain networks-even putatively later developing ones-generated accurate PMA prediction. Additionally, BAGs were associated with perinatal exposures and toddler behavioral outcomes. Overall, our results underscore the importance of normative modeling and deviations from these models during the perinatal period.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huili", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saloni", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Milana", "Last Name": "Khaitova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marisa", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dustin", "Last Name": "Scheinost", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr25"}, {"PMID": "38604780", "Title": "Mapping Early Brain-Body Interactions: Associations of Fetal Heart Rate Variation with Newborn Brainstem, Hypothalamic, and Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex Functional Connectivity.", "Abstract": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates the body's physiology, including cardiovascular function. As the ANS develops during the second to third trimester, fetal heart rate variability (HRV) increases while fetal heart rate (HR) decreases. In this way, fetal HR and HRV provide an index of fetal ANS development and future neurobehavioral regulation. Fetal HR and HRV have been associated with child language ability and psychomotor development behavior in toddlerhood. However, their associations with postbirth autonomic brain systems, such as the brainstem, hypothalamus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), have yet to be investigated even though brain pathways involved in autonomic regulation are well established in older individuals. We assessed whether fetal HR and HRV were associated with the brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC functional connectivity in newborns. Data were obtained from 60 pregnant individuals (ages 14-42) at 24-27 and 34-37\u2005weeks of gestation using a fetal actocardiograph to generate fetal HR and HRV. During natural sleep, their infants (38 males and 22 females) underwent a fMRI scan between 40 and 46\u2005weeks of postmenstrual age. Our findings relate fetal heart indices to brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC connectivity and reveal connections with widespread brain regions that may support behavioral and emotional regulation.

We characterized discrimination and acculturation experiences in a predominantly Hispanic sample of pregnant adolescent women and assessed their association with functional connectivity in their neonate's brain. We collected self-report measures of acculturation, discrimination, maternal distress (i.e., perceived stress, childhood trauma, and depressive symptoms), and socioeconomic status in 165 women. Then, we performed a data-driven clustering of acculturation, discrimination, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, trauma, and socioeconomic status variables during pregnancy to determine whether discrimination or acculturation clustered into distinct factors. Discrimination and acculturation styles loaded onto different factors from perceived stress, depressive symptoms, trauma, and socioeconomic status, suggesting that they were distinct from other factors in our sample. We associated these data-driven maternal phenotypes (discrimination and acculturation styles) with measures of resting-state functional MRI connectivity of the infant amygdala (n\u2009=\u200938). Higher maternal report of assimilation was associated with weaker connectivity between their neonate's amygdala and bilateral fusiform gyrus. Maternal experience of discrimination was associated with weaker connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex and stronger connectivity between the amygdala and fusiform of their neonate. Cautiously, the results may suggest a similarity to self-contained studies with adults, noting that the experience of discrimination and acculturation may influence amygdala circuitry across generations.

We utilized infant neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that maternal childhood maltreatment (CM) would be associated with increased fronto-limbic connectivity in infancy and tested brain-behavior associations in childhood.

We recruited children (N\u00a0=\u00a065) ages 4-10-years-old, of which 47.7 % (n\u00a0=\u00a031) reported a maternal history of MDD, and their biological mother (N\u00a0=\u00a065). Children performed a child-friendly Go/NoGo task while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded, and mothers performed a Flanker task. Children exhibited heightened sensitivity to error versus correct responses, which was characterized by an error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe) as well as prominent delta and frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations. Interestingly, worse maternal performance on the Flanker task associated with an increased Go/NoGo error rate and a smaller ERN and Pe in children. However, there was no association between maternal or child control indices with child depression symptoms.

Many of these models have been developed in samples of children school-aged or older. Nevertheless, despite growing evidence that altered brain maturation during the fetal, infant, and toddler (FIT) period modulates risk for poor mental health outcomes in childhood, these models are rarely implemented in FIT samples. Applications of predictive modeling in children of these ages provide an opportunity to develop powerful tools for improved characterization of the neural mechanisms underlying development. To facilitate the broader use of predictive models in FIT neuroimaging, we present a brief primer and systematic review on the methods used in current predictive modeling FIT studies.

A better understanding of in whom models fail and why is crucial to revealing robust, useful and unbiased brain-phenotype relationships. To this end, here we related brain activity to phenotype using predictive models-trained and tested on independent data to ensure generalizability15-and examined model failure. We applied this data-driven approach to a range of neurocognitive measures in a new, clinically and demographically heterogeneous dataset, with the results replicated in two independent, publicly available datasets16,17.

Model failure is reliable, phenotype specific and generalizable across datasets. Together, these results highlight the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all modelling approach and the effect of biased phenotypic measures18-20 on the interpretation and utility of resulting brain-phenotype models.

This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis to determine whether the weight of the evidence supports such an association. Studies with a categorical diagnosis of autism as the outcome and an assessment of its association with prenatal maternal infection or fever (or the data necessary to compute this association) were included. A total of 36 studies met these criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, methods of assessment, type of infectious agent, site of infection, trimester of exposure, definition of autism, and effect size. Analyses demonstrated a statistically significant association of maternal infection/fever with autism in offspring (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.20-1.46). Adjustment for evident publication bias slightly weakened this association. There was little variation in effect sizes across agent or site of infection. Small differences across trimester of exposure were not statistically significant. There was some evidence that recall bias associated with status on the outcome variable leads to differential misclassification of exposure status. Nonetheless, the overall association is only modestly reduced when studies potentially contaminated by such bias are removed. Although causality has not been firmly established, these findings suggest maternal infection during pregnancy confers an increase in risk for autism in offspring. Given the prevalence of this risk factor, it is possible that the incidence of autism would be reduced by 12%-17% if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner. LAY SUMMARY: This study is a meta-analysis of the association of maternal infection during pregnancy and subsequent autism in offspring. In combining the results from 36 studies of this association we find that a significant relationship is present. The association does not vary much across the types of infections or when they occur during pregnancy. We conclude that the incidence of autism could be substantially reduced if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner.", "Keywords": ["autism", "infections", "pregnancy", "prenatal", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Causality", "Female", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Tioleco", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna E", "Last Name": "Silberman", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katharine", "Last Name": "Stratigos", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharmila", "Last Name": "Banerjee-Basu", "Affiliation": "MindSpec Inc., McLean, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisa N", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Agnes H", "Last Name": "Whitaker", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "J Blake", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33345271", "Title": "Transdiagnostic, Connectome-Based Prediction of Memory Constructs Across Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Memory deficits are observed in a range of psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear whether memory deficits arise from a shared brain correlate across disorders or from various dysfunctions unique to each disorder. Connectome-based predictive modeling is a computational method that captures individual differences in functional connectomes associated with behavioral phenotypes such as memory. We used publicly available task-based functional MRI data from patients with schizophrenia (n\u00a0=\u200933), bipolar disorder (n\u00a0=\u200934), attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (n\u00a0=\u200932), and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u200973) to model the macroscale brain networks associated with working, short- and long-term memory. First, we use 10-fold and leave-group-out analyses to demonstrate that the same macroscale brain networks subserve memory across diagnostic groups and that individual differences in memory performance are related to individual differences within networks distributed throughout the brain, including the subcortex, default mode network, limbic network, and cerebellum. Next, we show that diagnostic groups are associated with significant differences in whole-brain functional connectivity that are distinct from the predictive models of memory. Finally, we show that models trained on the transdiagnostic sample generalize to novel, healthy participants (n\u2009=\u2009515) from the Human Connectome Project.

Translational human studies of MIA are few in number. Alterations of the salience network have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the same psychiatric disorders associated with MIA. If MIA is pathogenic, then associated abnormalities in the salience network should be detectable in neonates immediately after birth. We tested the hypothesis that third trimester MIA of adolescent women who are at risk for high stress and inflammation is associated with the strength of functional connectivity in the salience network of their neonate. Thirty-six women underwent blood draws to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and electrocardiograms to measure fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) at 34-37 weeks gestation. Resting-state imaging data were acquired in the infants at 40-44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Functional connectivity was measured from seeds placed in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Measures of cognitive development were obtained at 14 months PMA using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (BSID-III). Both sexes were studied. Regions in which the strength of the salience network correlated with maternal IL-6 or CRP levels included the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and basal ganglia. Maternal CRP level correlated inversely with FHRV acquired at the same gestational age. Maternal CRP and IL-6 levels correlated positively with measures of cognitive development on the BSID-III. These results suggest that MIA is associated with short- and long-term influences on offspring brain and behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates and epidemiological studies in humans suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) alters the development of brain circuitry and associated behaviors, placing offspring at risk for psychiatric illness. Consistent with preclinical findings, we show that maternal third trimester interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels are associated with neonatal functional connectivity and with both fetal and toddler behavior. MIA-related functional connectivity was localized to the salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Our results suggest that MIA alters functional connectivity in the neonatal brain, that those alterations have consequences for cognition, and that these findings may provide pathogenetic links between preclinical and epidemiological studies associating MIA with psychiatric risk in offspring.", "Keywords": ["cognition", "maternal C-reactive protein", "maternal immune activation", "maternal interleukin 6", "neonatal functional connectivity", "salience network"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Basal Ganglia", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Fetus", "Heart Rate, Fetal", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Behavior", "Infant, Newborn", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Third", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marisa N", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Monk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Dustin", "Last Name": "Scheinost", "Affiliation": "Radiology and Biomedical Imaging and in the Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}, {"First Name": "Bradley S", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Institute for the Developing Mind, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90027, and bpeterson@chla.usc.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Mar14"}, {"PMID": "29113038", "Title": "Micronutrient Dietary Intake in Latina Pregnant Adolescents and Its Association with Level of Depression, Stress, and Social Support.", "Abstract": "Adolescent pregnant women are at greater risk for nutritional deficits, stress, and depression than their adult counterparts, and these risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes are likely interrelated. This study evaluated the prevalence of nutritional deficits in pregnant teenagers and assessed the associations among micronutrient dietary intake, stress, and depression. One hundred and eight pregnant Latina adolescents completed an Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24) in the 2nd trimester. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale and the Prenatal Distress Questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale. Social support satisfaction was measured using the Social Support Questionnaire. More than 50% of pregnant teenagers had an inadequate intake (excluding dietary supplement) of folate, vitamin A, vitamin E, iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous. Additionally, >20% of participants had an inadequate intake of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, copper, and selenium. Prenatal supplement inclusion improved dietary intake for most micronutrients except for calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous, (>50% below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)) and for copper and selenium (>20% below the EAR). Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher energy, carbohydrates, and fats, and lower magnesium intake. Higher social support satisfaction was positively associated with dietary intake of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and zinc.

We collected a dataset of 12 extensively sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically configured scanners) to assess test-retest reliability of whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction. Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest for subcortical connections and highest for within-network cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used to improve prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this distinction for functional connectivity.

However, the association between autism and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an intracellular parasite, remains unclear. The authors examined whether serologically confirmed maternal antibodies to T. gondii are associated with odds of childhood autism in offspring. The study is based on a nested case-control design of a large national birth cohort (N\u2009=\u20091.2 million) and the national psychiatric registries in Finland. There were 874 cases of childhood autism and controls matched 1:1 on date of birth, sex, birthplace and residence in Finland. Maternal sera were prospectively assayed from a national biobank for T. gondii IgM and IgG antibodies; IgG avidity analyses were also performed. High maternal T. gondii IgM antibody was associated with a significantly decreased odds of childhood autism. Low maternal T. gondii IgG antibody was associated with increased offspring odds of autism. In women with high T. gondii IgM antibodies, the IgG avidity was high for both cases and controls, with the exception of three controls. The findings suggest that the relationship between maternal T. gondii antibodies and odds of childhood autism may be related to the immune response to this pathogen or the overall activation of the immune system.

Little is known about the morphological features of the neonatal brain that support the subsequent development of abilities in early childhood, when maturation of the brain and these abilities are the most dynamic. The goal of our study was to determine whether brain morphology during the neonatal period supports early cognitive development through 2 years of age. We correlated morphological features of the cerebral surface assessed using deformation-based measures (surface distances) of high-resolution MRI scans for 33 healthy neonates, scanned between the first to sixth week of postmenstrual life, with subsequent measures of their motor, language, and cognitive abilities at ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We found that morphological features of the cerebral surface of the frontal, mesial prefrontal, temporal, and occipital regions correlated with subsequent motor scores, posterior parietal regions correlated with subsequent language scores, and temporal and occipital regions correlated with subsequent cognitive scores. Measures of the anterior and middle portions of the cingulate gyrus correlated with scores across all three domains of ability. Most of the significant findings were inverse correlations located bilaterally in the brain. The inverse correlations may suggest either that a more protracted morphological maturation or smaller local volumes of neonatal brain tissue supports better performance on measures of subsequent motor, language, and cognitive abilities throughout the first 2 years of postnatal life. The correlations of morphological measures of the cingulate with measures of performance across all domains of ability suggest that the cingulate supports a broad range of skills in infancy and early childhood, similar to its functions in older children and adults.", "Keywords": ["brain", "cognition", "infant", "neonate"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Language", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motor Activity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marisa N", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "Center for Developmental Neuropsychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tove S", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bradley S", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human brain mapping", "PubDate": "2014Sep"}]
