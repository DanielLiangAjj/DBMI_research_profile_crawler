We now report that RhoA has not only inhibitory but also a stimulatory effect on axon development depending on when and where exerts its action and the downstream effectors involved. In cultured hippocampal neurons, FRET imaging revealed that RhoA activity selectively localizes in growth cones of undifferentiated neurites, while in developing axons it displays a biphasic pattern, being low in nascent axons and high in elongating ones. RhoA-Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling prevents axon initiation but has no effect on elongation, while formin inhibition reduces axon extension without significantly altering initial outgrowth. Besides, RhoA-mDia promotes axon elongation by stimulating growth cone microtubule stability and assembly, as opposed to RhoA-ROCK that restrains growth cone microtubule assembly and protrusion.", "Keywords": ["Axon outgrowth", "Growth Cone", "MDia", "Microtubules", "Neuronal Polarity", "RhoA"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jos\u00e9", "Last Name": "Wojnacki", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Gonzalo", "Last Name": "Quassollo", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Mart\u00edn D", "Last Name": "Bordenave", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Nicol\u00e1s", "Last Name": "Unsain", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Gaby F", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Alan M", "Last Name": "Szalai", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Pertz", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cell Biology, University of Bern, Baltzerstrasse 4, Bern, 3012, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Gregg G", "Last Name": "Gundersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Bartolini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fernando D", "Last Name": "Stefani", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "C\u00e1ceres", "Affiliation": "Centro Investigaci\u00f3n Medicina Traslacional Severo R Amuch\u00e1stegui (CIMETSA), Instituto Universitario Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas C\u00f3rdoba (IUCBC), Av.

The latter either directly activates the effector proteins or antagonizes the action of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-xL. The nuclear envelope is a known target of the apoptotic machinery; however, it may also act as mediator of apoptosis.

Nesprin-2 depletion also inhibited spontaneous exposure of the N-terminus of Bak in cells lacking Bcl-xL and increased the presence of Bcl-xL and Bax in the mitochondria.

The FHOD family in vertebrates comprises two structurally related proteins, FHOD1 and FHOD3. Their similar biochemical properties suggest overlapping and redundant functions. FHOD1 is widely expressed, FHOD3 less so, with highest expression in skeletal (FHOD1) and cardiac (FHOD3) muscle where specific splice isoforms are expressed. Unlike other formins, FHODs have strong F-actin bundling activity and relatively weak actin polymerization activity. These activities are regulated by phosphorylation by ROCK and Src kinases; bundling is additionally regulated by ERK1/2 kinases. FHODs are unique among formins in their association with the nuclear envelope through direct, high affinity binding to the outer nuclear membrane proteins nesprin-1G and nesprin-2G. Recent crystallographic structures reveal an interaction between a conserved motif in one of the spectrin repeats (SRs) of nesprin-1G/2G and a site adjacent to the regulatory domain in the amino terminus of FHODs. Nesprins are components of the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex that spans both nuclear membranes and mediates bidirectional transmission of mechanical forces between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. FHODs interact near the actin-binding calponin homology (CH) domains of nesprin-1G/2G enabling a branched connection to actin filaments that presumably strengthens the interaction. At the cellular level, the tethering of FHODs to the outer nuclear membrane mechanically couples perinuclear actin arrays to the nucleus to move and position it in fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and potentially other cells. FHODs also function in adhesion maturation during cell migration and in the generation of sarcomeres, activities distant from the nucleus but that are still influenced by it. Human genetic studies have identified multiple FHOD3 variants linked to dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, with many mutations mapping to \"hot spots\" in FHOD3 domains. We discuss how FHOD1/3's role in reinforcing the LINC complex and connecting to perinuclear actin contributes to functions of mechanically active tissues such as striated muscle.", "Keywords": ["FHOD", "LINC complex", "actin filaments", "formins", "mechanotransduction", "nesprins", "nucleus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susumu", "Last Name": "Antoku", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Thomas U", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gregg G", "Last Name": "Gundersen", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "35439057", "Title": "Nuclear lamin isoforms differentially contribute to LINC complex-dependent nucleocytoskeletal coupling and whole-cell mechanics.", "Abstract": "The ability of a cell to regulate its mechanical properties is central to its function. Emerging evidence suggests that interactions between the cell nucleus and cytoskeleton influence cell mechanics through poorly understood mechanisms. Here we conduct quantitative confocal imaging to show that the loss of A-type lamins tends to increase nuclear and cellular volume while the loss of B-type lamins behaves in the opposite manner. We use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, atomic force microscopy, optical tweezer microrheology, and traction force microscopy to demonstrate that A-type lamins engage with both F-actin and vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) through the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes to modulate cortical and cytoplasmic stiffness as well as cellular contractility in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In contrast, we show that B-type lamins predominantly interact with VIFs through LINC complexes to regulate cytoplasmic stiffness and contractility. We then propose a physical model mediated by the lamin\u2013LINC complex that explains these distinct mechanical phenotypes (mechanophenotypes). To verify this model, we use dominant negative constructs and RNA interference to disrupt the LINC complexes that facilitate the interaction of the nucleus with the F-actin and VIF cytoskeletons and show that the loss of these elements results in mechanophenotypes like those observed in MEFs that lack A- or B-type lamin isoforms.

In response to apoptotic signals the multi-domain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are activated and perforate the mitochondrial outer membrane by a mechanism which is inhibited by their interaction with pro-survival members of the family. However, other studies have shown that Bax and Bak may have additional, non-canonical functions, which include stress-induced nuclear envelope rupture and discharge of nuclear proteins into the cytosol. We show here that the apoptotic stimuli cisplatin and staurosporine induce a Bax/Bak-dependent degradation and subcellular redistribution of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 but not nesprin-3, of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. The degradation and redistribution were caspase-independent and did not occur in Bax/Bak double knockout (DKO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Re-expression of Bax in Bax/Bak DKO MEFs restored stress-induced redistribution of nesprin-2 by a mechanism which requires Bax membrane localization and integrity of the \u03b1 helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. We found that nesprin-2 interacts with Bax in close proximity to perinuclear mitochondria in mouse and human cells.

HGPS results from expression and abnormal nuclear envelope association of a farnesylated, truncated variant of prelamin A called \"progerin.\" We surveyed the diffusional mobilities of nuclear membrane proteins to identify proximal effects of progerin expression. The mobilities of three proteins-SUN2, nesprin-2G, and emerin-were reduced in fibroblasts from children with HGPS compared with those in normal fibroblasts. These proteins function together in nuclear movement and centrosome orientation in fibroblasts polarizing for migration. Both processes were impaired in fibroblasts from children with HGPS and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing progerin, but were restored by inhibiting protein farnesylation. Progerin affected both the coupling of the nucleus to actin cables and the oriented flow of the cables necessary for nuclear movement and centrosome orientation. Progerin overexpression increased levels of SUN1, which couples the nucleus to microtubules through nesprin-2G and dynein, and microtubule association with the nucleus. Reducing microtubule-nuclear connections through SUN1 depletion or dynein inhibition rescued the polarity defects. Nuclear movement and centrosome orientation were also defective in fibroblasts from normal individuals over 60 y, and both defects were rescued by reducing the increased level of SUN1 in these cells or inhibiting dynein.

To explore homeostatic nuclear positioning, we developed a method to displace nuclei in adherent cells using centrifugal force. Nuclei displaced by centrifugation rapidly recentered by mechanisms that depended on cell context. In cell\u00a0monolayers with wounds oriented orthogonal to the force, nuclei were displaced toward the front\u00a0and back of the cells on the two sides of the wound.

Nesprin-2G engaged actin through its N terminus and microtubules through a novel dynein interacting site near its C terminus.

Despite the observation that mechanical forces affect nuclear geometry and movement, how forces are applied onto the nucleus is not well understood. The nuclear LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex has been hypothesized to be the critical structure that mediates the transfer of mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton onto the nucleus. Previously used techniques for studying nuclear forces have been unable to resolve forces across individual proteins, making it difficult to clearly establish if the LINC complex experiences mechanical load. To directly measure forces across the LINC complex, we generated a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based tension biosensor for nesprin-2G, a key structural protein in the LINC complex, which physically links this complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Using this sensor we show that nesprin-2G is subject to mechanical tension in adherent fibroblasts, with highest levels of force on the apical and equatorial planes of the nucleus. We also show that the forces across nesprin-2G are dependent on actomyosin contractility and cell elongation. Additionally, nesprin-2G tension is reduced in fibroblasts from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients. This report provides the first, to our knowledge, direct evidence that nesprin-2G, and by extension the LINC complex, is subject to mechanical force. We also present evidence that nesprin-2G localization to the nuclear membrane is altered under high-force conditions. Because forces across the LINC complex are altered by a variety of different conditions, mechanical forces across the LINC complex, as well as the nucleus in general, may represent an important mechanism for mediating mechanotransduction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cell Nucleus", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Mice", "Movement", "Myosins", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul T", "Last Name": "Arsenovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Iswarya", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Kranthidhar", "Last Name": "Bathula", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Ruijun", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jiten D", "Last Name": "Narang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Natalie A", "Last Name": "Noll", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Lemmon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Gregg G", "Last Name": "Gundersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Conway", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.

Nuclei translated toward the substratum and began flattening during the early stages of cell spreading. Initially, nuclear height and width correlated with the degree of cell spreading, but over time, reached steady-state values even as the cell continued to spread. Actomyosin activity, actomyosin bundles, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, as well as the LINC complex, were all dispensable for nuclear flattening as long as the cell could spread. Inhibition of actin polymerization as well as myosin light chain kinase with the drug ML7 limited both the initial spreading of cells and flattening of nuclei, and for well-spread cells, inhibition of myosin-II ATPase with the drug blebbistatin decreased cell spreading with associated nuclear rounding. Together, these results show that cell spreading is necessary and sufficient to drive nuclear flattening under a wide range of conditions, including in the presence or absence of myosin activity.

We find that randomly migrating C2C12 myoblasts orient their centrosomes in the direction of migration. Using wounded monolayers, we further show that centrosome orientation is stimulated by the serum factor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and involves the rearward movement of the nucleus while the centrosome is maintained at the cell centroid. The rate of nuclear movement correlated with that of actin retrograde flow and both cytochalasin D and blebbistatin prevented nuclear movement and centrosome orientation. Actin-dependent rearward nuclear movement in fibroblasts is mediated by assembly of nuclear membrane nesprin-2G and SUN2 LINC complexes into transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines anchored by A-type lamins and emerin. In C2C12 myoblasts, depletion of nesprin-2G, SUN2 or lamin A/C prevented nuclear movement and endogenous nesprin-2G and a chimeric GFP-mini-nesprin-2G formed TAN lines during nuclear movement.

EDMD is both genetically and phenotypically variable, and some evidence of modifier genes has been reported. Six genes have so far been linked to EDMD, four encoding proteins associated with the LINC complex that connects the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. However, 50% of patients have no identifiable mutations in these genes. Using a candidate approach, we have identified putative disease-causing variants in the SUN1 and SUN2 genes, also encoding LINC complex components, in patients with EDMD and related myopathies. Our data also suggest that SUN1 and SUN2 can act as disease modifier genes in individuals with co-segregating mutations in other EDMD genes. Five SUN1/SUN2 variants examined impaired rearward nuclear repositioning in fibroblasts, confirming defective LINC complex function in nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling. Furthermore, myotubes from a patient carrying compound heterozygous SUN1 mutations displayed gross defects in myonuclear organization. This was accompanied by loss of recruitment of centrosomal marker, pericentrin, to the NE and impaired microtubule nucleation at the NE, events that are required for correct myonuclear arrangement. These defects were recapitulated in C2C12 myotubes expressing exogenous SUN1 variants, demonstrating a direct link between SUN1 mutation and impairment of nuclear-microtubule coupling and myonuclear positioning.

Here, we show that the mammalian homolog of Xenopus XKLP1, Kif4, is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of selective MT stabilization in fibroblasts. Kif4 localized to the ends of stable MTs and participated in the Rho-mDia-EB1 MT stabilization pathway since Kif4 depletion blocked mDia- and EB1-induced selective MT stabilization and EB1 was necessary for Kif4 induction of stable MTs. Kif4 and EB1 interacted in cell extracts, and binding studies revealed that the tail domain of Kif4 interacted directly with the N-terminal domain of EB1. Consistent with its role in regulating formation of stable MTs in interphase cells, Kif4 knockdown inhibited migration of cells into wounded monolayers.

In fibroblasts depleted of emerin, nuclei moved nondirectionally or completely failed to move. Consistent with these nuclear movement defects, dorsal actin cable flow was nondirectional in cells lacking emerin. TAN lines formed normally in cells lacking emerin and were coordinated with the erratic nuclear movements, although in 20% of the cases, TAN lines slipped over immobile nuclei.
