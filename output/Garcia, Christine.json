The predictive power of common variants outside the MUC5B locus for IPF and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) is unknown. Objectives: We tested the predictive value of IPF polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with and without the MUC5B region on IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Methods: We developed PRSs that included (PRS-M5B) and excluded (PRS-NO-M5B) the MUC5B region (500-kb window around rs35705950-T) using an IPF genome-wide association study. We assessed PRS associations with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metrics for IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Measurements and Main Results: We included 14,650 participants (1,970 IPF; 1,068 ILA) from six multi-ancestry population-based and case-control cohorts. In cases excluded from genome-wide association study, the PRS-M5B (odds ratio [OR] per SD of the score, 3.1; P\u2009=\u20097.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-95) and PRS-NO-M5B (OR per SD, 2.8; P\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-87) were associated with IPF. Participants in the top PRS-NO-M5B quintile had \u223csevenfold odds for IPF compared with those in the first quintile. A clinical model predicted IPF (AUC, 0.61); rs35705950-T and PRS-NO-M5B demonstrated higher AUCs (0.73 and 0.7, respectively), and adding both genetic predictors to a clinical model yielded the highest performance (AUC, 0.81). The PRS-NO-M5B was associated with ILA (OR, 1.25) and ILA progression (OR, 1.16) in European ancestry participants.

Prior studies have been limited by their cross-sectional design and potential confounding by body habitus. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that OSA severity is associated with more high-attenuation areas (HAAs) on computed tomography and worse lung function over time among older community-dwelling adults. Methods: We used data from participants in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) who had apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) measured from polysomnography (2010-2013), high attenuation areas (HAAs, -600 to -250 Hounsfield units, n\u2009=\u2009784), assessments from exams 5 (2010-2012) and 6 (2016-2018) full-lung computed tomography scans, and spirometry assessments (n\u2009=\u2009677). Linear mixed-effects models with random intercept were used to examine associations of OSA severity (i.e., AHI and hypoxic burden) with changes in HAAs, total lung volumes, and forced vital capacity (FVC) between exams 5 and 6. Potential confounders were adjusted for in the model, including age, sex, smoking history, height, and weight. Results: Among those with a higher AHI there were more men and a higher body mass index. Participants with AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u200915 events/h and in the highest hypoxic burden quartile each had increases in HAAs of 11.30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.74-19.35%) and 9.85% (95% CI, 1.40-19.01%) per 10 years, respectively. There was a more rapid decline in total lung volumes imaged and FVC among those with AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u200915 events/h of 220.2 ml (95% CI, 47.8-392.5 ml) and 3.63% (95% CI, 0.43-6.83%) per 10 years, respectively. Conclusions: A greater burden of hypoxia related to obstructive events during sleep was associated with increased lung densities over time and a more rapid decline in lung volumes regardless of body habitus. Our findings suggest OSA may be a contributing factor in the early stages of ILD.", "Keywords": ["hypoxia", "interstitial lung disease", "nocturnal oxygen saturation", "sleep apnea"], "MeSH terms":

Objectives: To determine whether proposed PPF criteria predict transplant-free survival (TFS) in patients with non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Methods: A retrospective, multicenter cohort analysis was performed. Patients with diagnoses of fibrotic connective tissue disease-associated ILD, fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and non-IPF idiopathic interstitial pneumonia from three U.S. centers and one UK center constituted the test and validation cohorts, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between 5-year TFS and \u2a7e10% FVC decline, followed by 13 additional PPF criteria satisfied in the absence of \u2a7e10% FVC decline. Measurements and Main Results: One thousand three hundred forty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. A \u2a7e10% relative FVC decline was the strongest predictor of reduced TFS and showed consistent TFS association across cohorts, ILD subtypes, and treatment groups, resulting in a phenotype that closely resembled IPF. Ten additional PPF criteria satisfied in the absence of 10% relative FVC decline were also associated with reduced TFS in the U.S. test cohort, with 6 maintaining TFS associations in the UK validation cohort. Validated PPF criteria requiring a combination of physiologic, radiologic, and symptomatic worsening performed similarly to their stand-alone components but captured a smaller number of patients. Conclusions: An FVC decline of \u2a7e10% and six additional PPF criteria satisfied in the absence of such decline identify patients with non-IPF ILD at increased risk for death or lung transplantation.", "Keywords": ["idiopathic interstitial pneumonia", "idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "interstitial lung disease", "progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease", "progressive pulmonary fibrosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Retrospective Studies", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Connective Tissue Diseases", "Prognosis", "Disease Progression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janelle Vu", "Last Name": "Pugashetti", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan."}, {"First Name": "Ayodeji", "Last Name": "Adegunsoye", "Affiliation": "Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Cathryn T", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Anand", "Last Name": "Srikrishnan", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas; and."}, {"First Name": "Sahand", "Last Name": "Ghodrati", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, California."}, {"First Name": "Vivian", "Last Name": "Vo", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, California."}, {"First Name": "Elisabetta A", "Last Name": "Renzoni", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Athol U", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Christine Kim", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Felix", "Last Name": "Chua", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Newton", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas; and."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "Molyneaux", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Justin M", "Last Name": "Oldham", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2023Jan01"}, {"PMID": "35777776", "Title": "Associations of hiatus hernia with CT-based interstitial lung changes: the MESA Lung Study.", "Abstract": "Hiatus hernia (HH) is prevalent in adults with pulmonary fibrosis.

It was, therefore, a good candidate to be tested in vivo on sensitive skin conditions. A pilot clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of this ingredient on healthy women showing excessive skin reactions, mainly redness and discomfort when subjected to external stress. The results showed that the daily consumption of 200 mg of CSO for 28 days effectively reduced redness induced by stripping stress and itching induced by stinging stress. It also improved the perception of skin sensitivity and reactivity after 56 days of consumption.

Measurements and Main Results: Gene burden analysis of 1,725 cases and 23,509 control subjects identified heterozygous rare deleterious variants in KIF15, a kinesin involved in spindle separation during mitosis, and three telomere-related genes (TERT [telomerase reverse transcriptase], RTEL1 [regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1], and PARN [poly(A)-specific ribonuclease]). KIF15 was implicated in autosomal-dominant models of rare deleterious variants (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-8.8; P\u2009=\u20092.55\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7) and rare protein-truncating variants (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 3.3-17.1; P\u2009=\u20098.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). Meta-analyses of the discovery and replication cohorts, including 2,966 cases and 29,817 control subjects, confirm the involvement of KIF15 plus the three telomere-related genes. A common variant within a KIF15 intron (rs74341405; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P\u2009=\u20095.63\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10) is associated with IPF risk, confirming a prior report. Lymphoblastoid cells from individuals heterozygous for the common variant have decreased KIF15 and reduced rates of cell growth. Cell proliferation is dependent on KIF15 in the presence of an inhibitor of Eg5/KIF11, which has partially redundant function. KIF15 is expressed specifically in replicating human lung cells and shows diminished expression in replicating epithelial cells of patients with IPF. Conclusions: Both rare deleterious variants and common variants in KIF15 link a nontelomerase pathway of cell proliferation with IPF susceptibility.", "Keywords": ["IPF", "KIF15", "cell proliferation", "genetics", "spindle"], "MeSH terms": ["Exome", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Kinesins", "Telomerase", "Telomere"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Gundula", "Last Name": "Povysil", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Philippe H", "Last Name": "Kobeissy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Binhan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Mason", "Last Name": "Amelotte", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Hager", "Last Name": "Jaouadi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Newton", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Toby M", "Last Name": "Maher", "Affiliation": "Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "Molyneaux", "Affiliation": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Imre", "Last Name": "Noth", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Fernando J", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill-Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Raghu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Jamie L", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Scott M", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Carolina", "Last Name": "Haefliger", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genomics Research, Discovery Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Platt", "Affiliation": "Translational Science and Experimental Medicine, Research and Early Development, Respiratory and Immunology, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom; and."}, {"First Name": "Slav\u00e9", "Last Name": "Petrovski", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genomics Research, Discovery Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Christine Kim", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2022Jul01"}, {"PMID": "35337808", "Title": "The Role of Genetic Testing in Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Perspective From the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Genetic Testing Work Group.", "Abstract": "Patients with familial pulmonary fibrosis represent a subset of patients with pulmonary fibrosis in whom inherited gene variation predisposes them to disease development.

Surveys were distributed annually from 2014 to 2017 to measure resident council members' perception of patient safety. The number of safety-related abstract/publications were tracked during and one year after graduation. Additionally, graduates from the council were surveyed to assess the influence of the council on post residency involvement and leadership in safety activities.A total of 18 residents have participated in the council from 2014 to 2017. Overall, resident perception of safety culture improved. A total of 17/18 (94%) PSQC resident members demonstrated scholarship activities in safety during residency: 8/18 (44%) were engaged in an independent Quality Improvement (QI) project, 5/18 (27%) achieved a quality improvement leadership role post residency.

COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4\u2009weeks from the onset of symptoms.

Inclusion of myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) in the IPAF criteria has generated controversy, as these patients also meet proposed criteria for an anti-synthetase syndrome. Whether MSAs and myositis associated antibodies (MAA) identify phenotypically distinct IPAF subgroups remains unclear.A multi-center, retrospective investigation was conducted to assess clinical features and outcomes in patients meeting IPAF criteria stratified by the presence of MSAs and MAAs. IPAF subgroups were compared to cohorts of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-ILD (IIM-ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IIM CTD-ILDs. The primary endpoint assessed was three-year transplant-free survival. Two hundred sixty-nine patients met IPAF criteria, including 35 (13%) with MSAs and 65 (24.2%) with MAAs. Survival was highest among patients with IPAF-MSA and closely approximated those with IIM-ILD. Survival did not differ between IPAF-MAA and IPAF without MSA/MAA cohorts. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) morphology was associated with differential outcome risk, with IPAF patients with non-UIP morphology approximating survival observed in non-IIM CTD-ILDs. MSAs, but not MAAs identified a unique IPAF phenotype characterised by clinical features and outcomes similar to IIM-ILD. UIP morphology was a strong predictor of outcome in others meeting IPAF criteria. Because IPAF is a research classification without clear treatment approach, these findings suggest MSAs should be removed from the IPAF criteria and such patients should be managed as an IIM-ILD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Iazsmin", "Last Name": "Bauer Ventura", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology, University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Newton", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern."}, {"First Name": "Cathryn", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Noelle", "Last Name": "Boctor", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Janelle Vu", "Last Name": "Pugashetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Cutting", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Joerns", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of Texas Southwestern."}, {"First Name": "Habrinder", "Last Name": "Sandhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan H", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Christine Kim", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kadoch", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of California at Davis."}, {"First Name": "Imre", "Last Name": "Noth", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Ayodeji", "Last Name": "Adegunsoye", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "Strek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Justin M", "Last Name": "Oldham", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of California at Davis joldham@ucdavis.edu."}], "Journal": "The European respiratory journal", "PubDate": "2020Jul16"}, {"PMID": "32656916", "Title": "Mechanisms to increase cascade testing in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: Impact of introducing standardized communication aids into genetic counseling.", "Abstract": "Precancer identification of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) could prevent 20% of these ovarian cancers.

Self-Collection for Human Papillomavirus Testing in Underscreened Women.", "Abstract": "Objective: Women without regular health care providers or a medical home routinely fail to complete recommended cervical cancer screening. At-home self-collection of samples to test for high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hrHPV) can improve screening rates. This study documents acceptability and feasibility of community lay navigator (LN)-facilitated at-home self-collection for underscreened women in Appalachian Virginia. Materials and Methods: This study used mixed methods in three phases. Phase I involved focus groups of LNs to ensure cultural acceptability of self-collection, and to enhance recruitment of medically underserved women. An environmental scan of community resources and climate was created in Phase II. During Phase III, underscreened women in Appalachian Virginia (the far southwest corner of Virginia) were recruited to complete hrHPV testing using LN-provided self-collection kits. Results: LN-facilitated at-home self-collection for HPV testing was deemed culturally acceptable and feasible to participants in this community-based pilot study. Self-kit training included 64 LNs, of which 35 engaged in the study and were provided 77 kits and instructions.

The MRI environment poses potential safety threats and is frequently associated with near misses or adverse events related to improper safety screening for presence of cardiac pacemakers and other potential contraindications. At our institution, MRI safety screening lacked a formalised structure and standardisation; the process relied on a single-step safety screening process. As a result, we observed a significant number of near misses associated with improper MRI screening that resulted in 'close calls' in patients with incompatible metals implants. The purpose of this project was to use a quality improvement approach to analyse the near-miss pattern and create a multistep intervention to decrease the number of near misses associated with MRI screening and to ultimately decrease the potential for patient harm. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, we decreased the number of MRI near misses from 22 to zero near misses in 1\u2009year after implementation. The project demonstrates successful transformation of near misses to a never event: a reportable event that should never happen.

This Review focuses on pathways underlying lung fibrosis that are generalizable to other organs. Herein, we discuss genetic variants subdivided into those that shorten telomeres, activate the DNA damage response, change resident protein expression or function, or affect organelle activity. Genetic studies provide a window into the downstream cascade of maladaptive responses and pathways that lead to tissue fibrosis. In addition, these studies reveal interactions between genetic variants, environmental factors, and age that influence the phenotypic spectrum of disease. The discovery of forces counterbalancing inherited risk alleles identifies potential therapeutic targets, thus providing hope for future prevention or reversal of fibrosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Alleles", "DNA Damage", "Fibrosis", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Variation", "Human Genetics", "Humans", "Lung Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christine Kim", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2018Jan02"}, {"PMID": "29204651", "Title": "Whole-Exome Sequencing in Adults With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "The utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the diagnosis and management of adult-onset constitutional disorders has not been adequately studied.

Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants, or those with a minor allele frequency of >5%, that are linked to pulmonary fibrosis. The most widely replicated variant (rs35705950) is located in the promoter region of the MUC5B gene and has been strongly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) across multiple different cohorts. However, many more common variants have been identified with disease risk and in aggregate account for approximately one-third of the risk of IPF. Moreover, several of these common variants appear to have prognostic potential. Next generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of rare variants. Recent whole exome sequencing studies have linked pathogenic rare variants in multiple new genes to FIP. Compared with common variants, rare variants have lower population allele frequencies and higher effect sizes. Pulmonary fibrosis rare variants genes can be subdivided into two pathways: telomere maintenance and surfactant metabolism. Heterozygous rare variants in telomere-related genes co-segregate with adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis with incomplete penetrance, lead to reduced protein function, and are associated with short telomere lengths. Despite poor genotype-phenotype correlations, lung fibrosis associated with pathogenic rare variants in different telomere genes is progressive and displays similar survival characteristics. In contrast, many of the heterozygous rare variants in the surfactant genes predict a gain of toxic function from protein misfolding and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Evidence of both telomere shortening and increased ER stress have been found in sporadic IPF patients, suggesting that the mechanisms identified from rare variant genetic studies in unique individuals and families are applicable to a wider spectrum of patients. The ability to sequence large cohorts of individuals rapidly has the potential to further our understanding of the relative contributions of common and rare variants in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.

Here, we study rare and common surfactant protein (SP)-A1 and SP-C variants, either discovered in our familial pulmonary fibrosis cohort or described by others. We show that expression of two SP-A1 (R219W and R242*) and three SP-C (I73T, M71V, and L188Q) variant proteins lead to the secretion of the profibrotic latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 in lung epithelial cell lines. The secreted TGF-\u03b21 is capable of autocrine and paracrine signaling and is dependent upon expression of the latent TGF-\u03b21 binding proteins. The dependence upon unfolded protein response (UPR) mediators for TGF-\u03b21 induction differs for each variant. TGF-\u03b21 secretion induced by the expression of the common SP-A1 R219W variant is nearly completely blocked by silencing the UPR transducers IRE-1\u03b1 and ATF6. In contrast, the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 induced by two rare SP-C mutant proteins (I73T and M71V), is largely unaffected by UPR silencing or by the addition of the small molecular chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid, implicating a UPR-independent mechanism for these variants.

However, traditional assays are limited by poor sensitivity, even among patients at high risk. cTnI was measured in 255 PH patients using a new highly sensitive (hs) assay. Other measures included demographics, creatinine, 6-minute walk distance, hemodynamics, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and B-type natriuretic peptide level. The association between cTnI and survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. cTnI was detectable with the hs assay in 95% of the patients with a median level of 6.9 pg/ml (IQR 2.7-12.6 pg/ml). Higher cTnI levels associated with higher levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, shorter 6-minute walk distance, and more severe hemodynamic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. During a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 60 individuals died. Unadjusted event rates increased across higher cTnI quartiles (3, 5, 13, 17 events/100 person-years, respectively, p trend = 0.002). cTnI in the fourth (vs first) quartile remained associated with death in a final stepwise multivariable model that included clinical variables and hemodynamics (adjusted hazard ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-15.6). In conclusion, cTnI levels, detectable with a novel hs assay, identify patients with PH who have more severe hemodynamic and cardiac structural abnormalities and provide novel and independent prognostic information. This hs assay has the potential to detect more at-risk patients and improve current risk-stratification algorithms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Assessment", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Severity of Illness Index", "Troponin I"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mariella", "Last Name": "V\u00e9lez-Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA. mariella.velez-martinez@phhs.org"}, {"First Name": "Colby", "Last Name": "Ayers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Mishkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sonja B", "Last Name": "Bartolome", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine K", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fernando", "Last Name": "Torres", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark H", "Last Name": "Drazner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "de Lemos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aslan T", "Last Name": "Turer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly M", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The American journal of cardiology", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23354021", "Title": "Long-range PCR based sequencing of the highly homologous genes, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2.", "Abstract": "In humans, Surfactant Protein A exists as two highly homologous genetic isoforms, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2.
