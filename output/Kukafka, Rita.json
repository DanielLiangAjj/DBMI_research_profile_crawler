We examined the impact of a web-based decision aid (DA) on BRCA1/2 genetic testing intention/completion among Orthodox Jewish women. We conducted a single-arm pilot study among 50 Orthodox Jewish women who were given access to a web-based DA entitled RealRisks and administered serial surveys at baseline and 1 and 6 months after exposure to the DA. Descriptive statistics were conducted for baseline characteristics and study measures. Comparisons were made to assess changes in study measures over time. Fifty Orthodox Jewish women enrolled in the study with a mean age of 43.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 14.6), 70% Modern Orthodox, 2% with personal history of breast cancer, and 68% and 16% with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, respectively. At baseline, 27 (54%) participants intended to complete genetic testing. Forty-three participants (86%) completed RealRisks and the 1-month survey and 38 (76%) completed the 6-month survey. There was a significant improvement in BRCA1/2 genetic testing knowledge and decrease in decisional conflict after exposure to the DA. At 1 month, only 20 (46.5%) completed or intended to complete genetic testing (p\u2009=\u20090.473 compared to baseline). While the DA improved genetic testing knowledge and reduced decisional conflict, genetic testing intention/completion did not increase over time. Future interventions should directly address barriers to BRCA1/2 genetic testing uptake and include input from leaders in the Orthodox Jewish community.", "Keywords": ["BRCA1/2", "Genetic testing", "Orthodox Jewish"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meghna S", "Last Name": "Trivedi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 161 Fort Washington Avenue HIP 10, New York, NY, 10032, USA. mst2134@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Haley", "Last Name": "Manley", "Affiliation": "College of Law, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haeseung", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Behavior Studies, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Silverman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Starck", "Affiliation": "Institute for Applied Research and Community Collaboration (ARCC), Spring Valley, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isaac", "Last Name": "Schecter", "Affiliation": "Institute for Applied Research and Community Collaboration (ARCC), Spring Valley, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Kukafka", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine D", "Last Name": "Crew", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 161 Fort Washington Avenue HIP 10, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Familial cancer", "PubDate": "2024Apr12"}, {"PMID": "38414240", "Title": "Return of polygenic risk scores in research: Stakeholders' views on the eMERGE-IV study.", "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes.

As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods.

A potential barrier to chemoprevention is competing comorbidities such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), due to concern for additional medication side effects. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among women with atypical hyperplasia (AH) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), an important target population for chemoprevention. We compared risks for breast cancer and ASCVD, as well as use of SERMs/AIs versus statins among high-risk women (defined as a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk \u22651.67% and 10-year ASCVD risk \u22657.5%, respectively). We used clinical data extracted from the electronic health record to calculate breast cancer risk according to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model and ASCVD risk according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator. Among 298 evaluable women, mean age was 58.2 years (SD, 8.34), with 33% non-Hispanic White, 41% Hispanic, 9% non-Hispanic Black, 6% Asian, and 11% other/unknown race/ethnicity. About 98% of women met high-risk criteria for breast cancer, whereas 30% were high-risk for ASCVD. Mean 10-year risk of breast cancer was higher than mean 10-year risk of ASCVD (9.14% vs. 6.69%; P < 0.001). Among women who met high-risk criteria for both diseases, use of statins was higher compared with SERMs/AIs (58% vs. 21%; P < 0.001).

The study objective was to assess the threat and coping appraisals (cognitive factors known to correspond with people's willingness to adopt behaviorally focused interventions) and levels of distress, anxiety, and intolerance for uncertainty (emotional factors). Survey respondents were recruited in April 2020 using an online survey with unpaid recruitment on the GetHealthyHeights.org community-oriented website. We also recruited participants that engaged in previous research studies to gain survey responses from community members at higher risk for COVID-19 complications due to comorbidities compared to the general population. Analysis was performed to test for differences in survey responses by comorbidities, age, race, ethnicity, and employment status. Results show that the devastating effects of the pandemic appear to have uniquely impacted minority respondents, who reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and were significantly more likely to report having little control over whether they will get COVID-19 compared with White/non-Hispanic respondents. Minority respondents also had significantly higher mean scores on the behaviorally focused dimension of the intolerance of uncertainty (IU) scale, which measures avoidance and paralysis in the face of uncertainty. In multivariate analysis, IU predicted anxiety levels, and this association was not mediated by cognitive factors (threat and coping appraisals). By conducting this survey early in the pandemic, our study uniquely evaluated cognitive and emotional factors among a racially/ethnically diverse group of NYC residents during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest the need to acknowledge the disparities that appear to exist in pandemic response and for culturally tailored messaging and interventions. Few studies have reported differences by race and ethnicity during pandemic exposure.

They completed a questionnaire on breast cancer risk factors and permitted access to their medical records. Breast cancer risk status was determined using the Gail model and a family history screener. High risk was defined as a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk of \u22651.67% or eligible for BRCA genetic testing. False positive results were defined as recall breast imaging (BIRADS score of 0, 3, 4, or 5) and/or biopsies that did not yield breast cancer.Results: From November 2014 to October 2015, 2,361 women were enrolled and 2,019 were evaluable, of whom 76% were Hispanic and 10% non-Hispanic white. Fewer Hispanic women met high-risk criteria for breast cancer than non-Hispanic whites (18.0% vs. 68.1%), but Hispanics more frequently engaged in annual screening (71.9% vs. 60.8%). Higher breast density (heterogeneously/extremely dense vs. mostly fat/scattered fibroglandular densities) and more frequent screening (annual vs. biennial) were significantly associated with false positive results [odds ratio (OR), 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-2.04 and OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.70-2.80, respectively].Conclusions: We observed that women who screened more frequently or had higher breast density were at greater risk for false positive results.

The utilization of a risk-based stratification model, genetic testing, and chemoprevention could decrease the incidence of invasive breast cancer but uptake has been low among high-risk women. The goal of this project was to implement a comprehensive informatics framework to promote breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting that was informed by potential user feedback. The framework provides evidence-based decision support to both providers and patients. For providers we developed a novel breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool which incorporates an evidence-based breast cancer risk model into the electronic health record. For patients a decision aid was designed that allows participants to experience risk through an activity and to address patient-related barriers to chemoprevention. We conducted usability testing to determine barriers and facilitators affecting the toolbox use by providers. A total of seven subjects were recruited and completed the usability testing. Using think-aloud protocols, semi-structured interviews, and subject recordings, we identified recurring themes related to the usability of BNAV. Themes specifically aligned with the content, ease of use, and navigation of the application. This feedback was used to make interface changes to the application that more appropriately tailored BNAV to engage the target population of primary care providers and thus more effectively optimizing shared decision-making associated with breast cancer risk assessment and prevention in clinical practice. A comprehensive informatics framework to increase breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting has been successfully introduced to address this challenge.

Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors can reduce breast cancer risk; however, uptake is estimated to be less than 15% in these populations. We sought to determine which factors are associated with chemoprevention uptake in a population of women with atypical hyperplasia, LCIS, and DCIS. Women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia/LCIS/DCIS between 2007 and 2015 without a history of invasive breast cancer were identified (N = 1,719). A subset of women (n = 73) completed questionnaires on breast cancer and chemoprevention knowledge, risk perception, and behavioral intentions. Descriptive statistics were generated and univariate and multivariable log-binomial regression were used to estimate the association between sociodemographic and clinical factors and chemoprevention uptake. In our sample, 29.3% had atypical hyperplasia, 23.3% had LCIS, and 47.4% had DCIS; 29.4% used chemoprevention. Compared with women with atypical hyperplasia, LCIS [RR, 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-1.76] and DCIS (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28-1.86) were significantly associated with chemoprevention uptake, as was medical oncology referral (RR, 5.79; 95% CI, 4.80-6.98). Younger women were less likely to take chemoprevention (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), and there was a trend toward increased uptake in Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white women.

Using the multi-level orientation of the ITIF, we set forth strategies beyond IT solutions that can have an impact on reengineering clinical research tasks in practice-based settings. Developing strategies to target enabling and reinforcing factors, which focus on organizational factors, and the motivation of the practice at large to use IT solutions to integrate clinical research tasks with patient care processes, is most challenging. The ITIF should be used to consider both IT and non-IT solutions concurrently for reengineering of clinical research in community-based practice settings.", "Keywords": ["Clinical research", "Clinical trials", "Community-based practice", "Informatics", "Information technology"], "MeSH terms": ["Community Health Services", "Community Participation", "Humans", "Information Systems", "Professional Competence", "Research Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Kukafka", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. rita.kukafka@dbmi.columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Allegrante", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharib", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Thomas", "Last Name": "Bigger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen B", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Contemporary clinical trials", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}]
