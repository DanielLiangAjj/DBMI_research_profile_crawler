However, the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we combined single-cell analyses of FTD patient brains with a stem cell culture and transplantation model of FTD. We identified disease phenotypes in FTD neurons carrying the MAPT-N279K mutation, which were related to oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation with an upregulation of the inflammation-associated protein osteopontin (OPN). Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts. Notably, downregulation of OPN in engrafted FTD neurons resulted in improved engraftment and reduced microglial infiltration, indicating an immune-modulatory role of OPN in patient neurons, which may represent a potential therapeutic target in FTD.", "Keywords": ["FTD", "MAPT N279K", "OPN", "Spp1", "Tau", "disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia", "induced pluripotent stem cells", "microglia", "neuroinflammation", "osteopontin", "single nucleus RNA sequencing", "snRNA-seq", "transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Osteopontin", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Neurons", "Animals", "tau Proteins", "Mice", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Microglia", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA;

Comparisons to single-cell transcriptomic data from the mouse hypothalamus suggested extensive conservation of neuronal subtypes despite certain differences in species-enriched gene expression. The uniqueness of hypothalamic neuronal lineages was examined developmentally by comparing excitatory lineages present in cortex and inhibitory lineages in ganglionic eminence, revealing both distinct and shared drivers of neuronal maturation across the human forebrain.

To address this gap, we generate a high-resolution chromatin architecture atlas of an established embryonic stem cell derived hypothalamic-like neuron model across three stages of in vitro differentiation. We profile accessible chromatin and identify physical contacts between gene promoters and putative cis-regulatory elements to characterize global regulatory landscape changes during hypothalamic differentiation.

Eighty percent of constrained 2015 loci achieved genome-wide significance in 2018. We observed similar results in waist-to-hip ratio analyses. In conclusion, biological constraints on sub-significant GWAS signals can reveal potentially true-positive loci for further investigation in existing data sets without increasing sample size.", "Keywords": ["Capture C", "GWAS", "bioinformatics", "body mass index", "computational biology", "functional genomics", "genetics", "genomics", "human", "systems biology", "waist-hip ratio"], "MeSH terms": ["Body Mass Index", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reza K", "Last Name": "Hammond", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew C", "Last Name": "Pahl", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chun", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Diana L", "Last Name": "Cousminer", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michelle E", "Last Name": "Leonard", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sumei", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Claudia A", "Last Name": "Doege", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yadav", "Last Name": "Wagley", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenyaita M", "Last Name": "Hodge", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Lasconi", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew E", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Pippin", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kurt D", "Last Name": "Hankenson", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics (Pediatrics) and the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Chesi", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Struan Fa", "Last Name": "Grant", "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2021Jan18"}, {"PMID": "33069917", "Title": "Variant-to-Gene-Mapping Analyses Reveal a Role for the Hypothalamus in Genetic Susceptibility to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.", "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a polygenic disorder characterized principally by dysregulated inflammation impacting the gastrointestinal tract.

Rare LEP mutations associated with congenital leptin deficiency cause severe early-onset obesity that can be mitigated by administering leptin. However, the role of genetic regulation of leptin in polygenic obesity remains poorly understood. We performed an exome-based analysis in up to 57,232 individuals of diverse ancestries to identify genetic variants that influence adiposity-adjusted leptin concentrations. We identify five novel variants, including four missense variants, in LEP, ZNF800, KLHL31, and ACTL9, and one intergenic variant near KLF14. The missense variant Val94Met (rs17151919) in LEP was common in individuals of African ancestry only, and its association with lower leptin concentrations was specific to this ancestry (P = 2 \u00d7 10-16, n = 3,901). Using in vitro analyses, we show that the Met94 allele decreases leptin secretion. We also show that the Met94 allele is associated with higher BMI in young African-ancestry children but not in adults, suggesting that leptin regulates early adiposity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

gene (FTO) that are highly associated with increased body weight have been implicated in the transcriptional control of a nearby ciliary gene, retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like (RPGRIP1L). Previous studies have shown that congenital Rpgrip1l hypomorphism in murine proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) neurons causes obesity by increasing food intake. Here, we show by congenital and adult-onset Rpgrip1l deletion in Pomc-expressing neurons that the hyperphagia and obesity are likely due to neurodevelopmental effects that are characterized by a reduction in the Pomc/Neuropeptide Y (Npy) neuronal number ratio and marked increases in arcuate hypothalamic-paraventricular hypothalamic (ARH-PVH) axonal projections. Biallelic RPGRIP1L mutations result in fewer cilia-positive human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) neurons and blunted responses to Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). Isogenic human ARH-like embryonic stem cell-derived (ESc-derived) neurons homozygous for the obesity-risk alleles at rs8050136 or rs1421085 have decreased RPGRIP1L expression and have lower numbers of POMC neurons. RPGRIP1L overexpression increases POMC cell number. These findings suggest that apparently functional intronic polymorphisms affect hypothalamic RPGRIP1L expression and impact development of POMC neurons and their derivatives, leading to hyperphagia and increased adiposity.", "Keywords": ["Embryonic development", "Metabolism", "NPY", "Neuroscience", "Obesity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alain J", "Last Name": "De Solis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuronal Control of Metabolism, Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yossef", "Last Name": "Goffer", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Birkenbach", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Staci E", "Last Name": "Engle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ross", "Last Name": "Tanis", "Affiliation": "University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob M", "Last Name": "Levenson", "Affiliation": "University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xueting", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition graduate program, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Rausch", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manika", "Last Name": "Purohit", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jen-Yi", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Laboratory Molecular Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerica", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria Caterina", "Last Name": "De Rosa", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia A", "Last Name": "Doege", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Holly L", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Laboratory Molecular Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela J", "Last Name": "Martins", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jens C", "Last Name": "Br\u00fcning", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuronal Control of Metabolism, Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Berbari", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Stratigopoulos", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019Feb07"}, {"PMID": "32694784", "Title": "Functional identity of hypothalamic melanocortin neurons depends on Tbx3.", "Abstract": "Heterogeneous populations of hypothalamic neurons orchestrate energy balance via the release of specific signatures of neuropeptides. However, how specific intracellular machinery controls peptidergic identities and function of individual hypothalamic neurons remains largely unknown. The transcription factor T-box 3 (Tbx3) is expressed in hypothalamic neurons sensing and governing energy status, whereas human TBX3 haploinsufficiency has been linked with obesity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Tbx3 function in hypothalamic neurons causes weight gain and other metabolic disturbances by disrupting both the peptidergic identity and plasticity of Pomc/Cart and Agrp/Npy neurons. These alterations are observed after loss of Tbx3 in both immature hypothalamic neurons and terminally differentiated mouse neurons. We further establish the importance of Tbx3 for body weight regulation in Drosophila melanogaster and show that TBX3 is implicated in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hypothalamic Pomc neurons. Our data indicate that Tbx3 directs the terminal specification of neurons as functional components of the melanocortin system and is required for maintaining their peptidergic identity.

PC1/3 deficiency was associated with increased expression of melanocortin receptors and PRCP (prolylcarboxypeptidase, a catabolic enzyme for \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH)), and reduced adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.

No therapeutic approaches are available that alter the relentless course of AD or other dementias of aging. A major hurdle to the development of effective therapeutics has been the lack of predictive model systems in which to develop and validate candidate therapies. Animal model studies based on the analysis of transgenic mice that overexpress rare familial AD-associated mutant genes have been informative about mechanisms of familial disease, but they have not proven predictive for drug development. New approaches to disease modeling are of particular interest. Methods such as epigenetic reprogramming of patient skin fibroblasts to human induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be differentiated into patient-derived neuron subtypes, have generated significant excitement because of their potential to model more accurately aspects of human neurodegeneration.
