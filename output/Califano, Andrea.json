Current studies linking individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to AS in a few neuron types underscore the need for holistic modeling. Here, we use network reverse engineering to derive a map of the neuron type-specific AS regulatory landscape from 133 mouse neocortical cell types defined by single-cell transcriptomes. This approach reliably inferred the regulons of 350 RBPs and their cell type-specific activities. Our analysis revealed driving factors delineating neuronal identities, among which we validated Elavl2 as a key RBP for MGE-specific splicing in GABAergic interneurons using an in vitro ESC differentiation system. We also identified a module of exons and candidate regulators specific for long- and short-projection neurons across multiple neuronal classes.

Through the analysis of tazemetostat-treated patient tumors, we recently defined key principles of their response and resistance to EZH2 epigenetic therapy.

RMC-7977 is a highly selective inhibitor of the active GTP-bound forms of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS, with affinity for both mutant and wild-type variants3. More than 90% of cases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are driven by activating mutations in KRAS4. Here we assessed the therapeutic potential of RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumour activity across models following direct RAS inhibition at exposures that were well-tolerated in vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumour versus normal tissues. Treated tumours exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest, whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis. In the autochthonous KPC mouse model, RMC-7977 treatment resulted in a profound extension of survival followed by on-treatment relapse. Analysis of relapsed tumours identified Myc copy number gain as a prevalent candidate resistance mechanism, which could be overcome by combinatorial TEAD inhibition in vitro. Together, these data establish a strong preclinical rationale for the use of broad-spectrum RAS-GTP inhibition in the setting of PDAC and identify a promising candidate combination therapeutic regimen to overcome monotherapy resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Line, Tumor",

Here, we identify the SNF2-family DNA translocase SMARCAL1 as a factor that favors tumor immune evasion by a dual mechanism involving both the suppression of innate immune signaling and the induction of PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint responses. Mechanistically, SMARCAL1 limits endogenous DNA damage, thereby suppressing cGAS-STING-dependent signaling during cancer cell growth. Simultaneously, it cooperates with the AP-1 family member JUN to maintain chromatin accessibility at a PD-L1 transcriptional regulatory element, thereby promoting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. SMARCAL1 loss hinders the ability of tumor cells to induce PD-L1 in response to genomic instability, enhances anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in a mouse melanoma model.

Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is implicated in neural cell differentiation and cancer cell survival. Here, we show that ATF5 is highly expressed in patients with stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, with increased expression correlating with a poorer prognosis. We demonstrated that ATF5 promotes the metastasis of neuroblastoma cell lines in vivo. Functionally, ATF5 depletion significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow and liver. Mechanistically, ATF5 endows tumor cells with resistance to anoikis, thereby increasing their survival in systemic circulation and facilitating metastasis. We identified the proapoptotic BCL-2 modifying factor (BMF) as a critical player in ATF5-regulated neuroblastoma anoikis. ATF5 suppresses BMF under suspension conditions at the transcriptional level, promoting anoikis resistance, whereas BMF knockdown significantly prevents ATF5 depletion-induced anoikis. Therapeutically, we showed that a cell-penetrating dominant-negative ATF5 peptide, CP-d/n-ATF5, inhibits neuroblastoma metastasis to the bone marrow and liver by inducing anoikis sensitivity in circulating tumor cells.

Human CRPC-NE but not primary NEPC tumors expresses high levels of NSD2, consistent with a key role for NSD2 in lineage plasticity, and high NSD2 expression in mCRPC correlates with poor survival outcomes. Notably, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of NSD2 or expression of a dominant-negative oncohistone H3.3K36M mutant results in loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes and restores responsiveness to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide in mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids and grafts.

In human lung cancer models UHRF1 knock-out selectively impaired growth and induced apoptosis only in KRAS mutant cells. Genome-wide methylation and gene expression analysis of UHRF1-depleted KRAS mutant cells revealed global DNA hypomethylation leading to upregulation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). A focused CRISPR/Cas9 screen validated several of these TSGs as mediators of UHRF1-driven tumorigenesis. In vivo, UHRF1 knock-out inhibited tumor growth of KRAS-driven mouse lung cancer models.

performed regulatory network analysis on a large collection of expression profiles from laser capture microdissected samples of PDAC and benign precursors. We discovered that BMAL2 plays a role in the initiation, progression, post resection survival, and KRAS activity in PDAC. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes led us to hypothesize that it plays a role in regulating the response to hypoxia, a critical but poorly understood feature of PDAC physiology. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines revealed effects on viability and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Loss of BMAL2 also affected glycolysis and other metabolic processes. We found that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes. We also found that BMAL2 is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A upon exposure to hypoxia, but destabilizes HIF2A under hypoxia. These data demonstrate that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC and may serve as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H Carlo", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Garcia-Curiel", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sam R", "Last Name": "Holmstrom", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Castillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Carmine F", "Last Name": "Palermo", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Sastra", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Andren", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Tessa Y S", "Last Name": "Le Large", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Amsterdam UMC, Location Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Sagalovskiy", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kaitlin", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Department of Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine", "Last Name": "Genkinger", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alina C", "Last Name": "Iuga", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Roland M", "Last Name": "Schmid", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "University of New Hampshire, Manchester, NH."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Badgley", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Costas A", "Last Name": "Lyssiotis", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Yatrik", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun22"}, {"PMID": "36981431", "Title": "NaRnEA: An Information Theoretic Framework for Gene Set Analysis.", "Abstract": "Gene sets are being increasingly leveraged to make high-level biological inferences from transcriptomic data; however, existing gene set analysis methods rely on overly conservative, heuristic approaches for quantifying the statistical significance of gene set enrichment.

By measuring the differential activity of ~2500 transcriptional regulatory proteins based on the differential expression of each protein's transcriptional targets between primary tumors and normal tissue samples in three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we demonstrate that NaRnEA critically improves in two widely used gene set analysis methods: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and analytical-Rank-based Enrichment Analysis (aREA).

However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations, collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pools, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants.

Although advances in molecular biology have helped identify molecular markers and stratify patients into molecular subtypes, these associational strategies typically fail to provide a mechanistic rationale to identify cancer vulnerabilities. Recently, integrative systems biology methodologies have been used to reverse engineer cellular networks and identify master regulators (MRs), proteins whose activity is both necessary and sufficient to implement phenotypic states under physiological and pathological conditions, which are organized into highly interconnected regulatory modules called tumor checkpoints. Because of their functional relevance, MRs represent ideal pharmacological targets and biomarkers. Here, we present a six-step patient-to-model-to-patient protocol that employs computational and experimental methodologies to reconstruct and interrogate the regulatory logic of human cancer cells for identifying and therapeutically targeting the tumor checkpoint with novel as well as existing pharmacological agents. This protocol systematically identifies, from specific patient tumor samples, the MRs that comprise the tumor checkpoint. Then, it identifies in vitro and in vivo models that, by recapitulating the patient's tumor checkpoint, constitute the appropriate cell lines and xenografts to further elucidate the tissue context-specific drug mechanism of action (MOA) and permit precise, biomarker-based preclinical validations of drug efficacy. The combination of determination of a drug's context-specific MOA and precise identification of patients' tumor checkpoints provides a personalized, mechanism-based biomarker to enrich prospective clinical trials with patients likely to respond. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell transcriptional machinery to induce a phenotypic state amenable to its replication. Specifically, analysis of Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic determinants of the gene expression signature induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells revealed coordinated inactivation of MRs enriched in physical interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, suggesting their mechanistic role in maintaining a host cell state refractory to virus replication. To test their functional relevance, we measured SARS-CoV-2 replication in epithelial cells treated with drugs predicted to activate the entire repertoire of repressed MRs, based on their experimentally elucidated, context-specific mechanism of action. Overall, >80% of drugs predicted to be effective by this methodology induced significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication, without affecting cell viability.

Available treatments provide a temporary reprieve, but secondary failure rates are high, making insulin supplementation necessary. Reversibility of \u03b2 cell failure is a key translational question. Here, we reverse engineered and interrogated pancreatic islet-specific regulatory networks to discover T2D-specific subpopulations characterized by metabolic inflexibility and endocrine progenitor/stem cell features. Single-cell gain- and loss-of-function and glucose-induced Ca2+ flux analyses of top candidate master regulatory (MR) proteins in islet cells validated transcription factor BACH2 and associated epigenetic effectors as key drivers of T2D cell states. BACH2 knockout in T2D islets reversed cellular features of the disease, restoring a nondiabetic phenotype. BACH2-immunoreactive islet cells increased approximately 4-fold in diabetic patients, confirming the algorithmic prediction of clinically relevant subpopulations. Treatment with a BACH inhibitor lowered glycemia and increased plasma insulin levels in diabetic mice, and restored insulin secretion in diabetic mice and human islets.

However, we show here that membranous HER3 protein is commonly highly expressed in lethal prostate cancer, associating with reduced time to castration resistance (CR) and survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence indicated that the HER3 ligand NRG1 is detectable primarily in tumor-infiltrating myelomonocytic cells in human prostate cancer; this observation was confirmed using single-cell RNA sequencing of human prostate cancer biopsies and murine transgenic prostate cancer models. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient-derived xenograft organoids with high HER3 expression as well as mouse prostate cancer organoids, recombinant NRG1 enhanced proliferation and survival. Supernatant from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells promoted murine prostate cancer organoid growth in vitro, which could be reversed by a neutralizing anti-NRG1 antibody and ERBB inhibition. Targeting HER3, especially with the HER3-directed antibody-drug conjugate U3-1402, exhibited antitumor activity against HER3-expressing prostate cancer. Overall, these data indicate that HER3 is commonly overexpressed in lethal prostate cancer and can be activated by NRG1 secreted by myelomonocytic cells in the tumor microenvironment, supporting HER3-targeted therapeutic strategies for treating HER3-expressing advanced CRPC.

As a disease, they are uniquely sensitive to histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, both alone and in combination, are characterized by a host of mutations in epigenetic genes, and can develop spontaneously in genetically engineered murine models predicated on established recurring mutations in (RHOAG17V) and TET2, an epigenetic gene governing DNA methylation. Given the clinical benefit of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) and hypomethlyation agents alone and in combination in PTCL, we sought to explore a mechanistic basis for these agents in PTCL. Herein, we reveal profound class synergy between HDAC and DNMT inhibitors in PTCL, and that the combination induces degrees of gene expression that are substantially different and more extensive than that observed for the single agents. A prominent signature of the combination relates to the transcriptional induction of cancer testis antigens and genes involved in the immune response. Interestingly, TBX21 and STAT4, master regulators of TH1 differentiation, were among the genes upregulated by the combination, suggesting the induction of a TH1-like phenotype. Moreover, suppression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and the matrisome were also identified.

Our study investigates CAF functions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a highly desmoplastic liver tumor. Genetic tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and ligand-receptor analyses uncovered hepatic stellate cells (HSC) as the main source of CAF and HSC-derived CAF as the dominant population interacting with tumor cells. In mice, CAF promotes ICC progression, as revealed by HSC-selective CAF depletion. In patients, a high panCAF signature is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing segregates CAF into inflammatory and growth factor-enriched (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations, displaying distinct ligand-receptor interactions. myCAF-expressed hyaluronan synthase 2, but not type I collagen, promotes ICC. iCAF-expressed hepatocyte growth factor enhances ICC growth via tumor-expressed MET, thus directly linking CAF to tumor cells. In summary, our data demonstrate promotion of desmoplastic ICC growth by therapeutically targetable CAF subtype-specific mediators, but not by type I collagen.", "Keywords": ["CellPhoneDB", "HGF", "KRAS", "YAP", "cholangiocarcinoma", "immune", "mechanosensitive", "single cell", "stiffness", "tumor microenvironment"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Animals", "Bile Duct Neoplasms", "Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic", "Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts", "Cholangiocarcinoma", "Collagen Type I", "Female", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Hepatocyte Growth Factor", "Humans", "Hyaluronan Synthases", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Male", "Mice, Transgenic", "Middle Aged", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Affo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Brundu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aashreya", "Last Name": "Ravichandra", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonakshi", "Last Name": "Bhattacharjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michitaka", "Last Name": "Matsuda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA."}, {"First Name": "LiKang", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Penn Physical Sciences in Oncology Center PSOC@Penn, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aveline", "Last Name": "Filliol", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubrianna", "Last Name": "Decker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Worley", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jorge Matias", "Last Name": "Caviglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lexing", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deqi", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshinobu", "Last Name": "Saito", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Savage", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca G", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Penn Physical Sciences in Oncology Center PSOC@Penn, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Mack", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Zender", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany;

Few models exist that facilitate in-depth study of each of the three canonical phases of immunoediting: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Here, we utilized NPK-C1, a transplantable prostate tumor model that we found recapitulated the three phases of immunoediting spontaneously in immunocompetent animals. Given that a significant portion of NPK-C1 tumors reliably progressed to the escape phase, we were able to delineate cell types and mechanisms differentially prevalent in equilibrium versus escape phases. Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, we found that activated CD4+ effector T cells were enriched in regressing tumors, highlighting a role for CD4+ T cells in antitumor immunity. CD8+ T cells were also important for NPK-C1 control, specifically, central memory-like cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg), as a whole, were counterintuitively enriched in regressing tumors; however, high-dimensional analysis revealed their significant phenotypic diversity, with a number of Treg subpopulations enriched in progressing tumors. In the myeloid compartment, we found that iNOS+ dendritic cell (DC)-like cells are enriched in regressing tumors, whereas CD103+ DCs were associated with late-stage tumor progression.

However, oncogenic consequences of ARID1A mutation in human cells remain poorly defined due to lack of forward genetic models. Here, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ARID1A knockout (KO) in primary TP53-/- human gastric organoids induced morphologic dysplasia, tumorigenicity, and mucinous differentiation. Genetic WNT/\u03b2-catenin activation rescued mucinous differentiation, but not hyperproliferation, suggesting alternative pathways of ARID1A KO-mediated transformation. ARID1A mutation induced transcriptional regulatory modules characteristic of microsatellite instability and Epstein-Barr virus-associated subtype human gastric cancer, including FOXM1-associated mitotic genes and BIRC5/survivin. Convergently, high-throughput compound screening indicated selective vulnerability of ARID1A-deficient organoids to inhibition of BIRC5/survivin, functionally implicating this pathway as an essential mediator of ARID1A KO-dependent early-stage gastric tumorigenesis. Overall, we define distinct pathways downstream of oncogenic ARID1A mutation, with nonessential WNT-inhibited mucinous differentiation in parallel with essential transcriptional FOXM1/BIRC5-stimulated proliferation, illustrating the general utility of organoid-based forward genetic cancer analysis in human cells. SIGNIFICANCE: We establish the first human forward genetic modeling of a commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene, ARID1A.

They are essential for macromolecular complex formation, which in turn constitutes the basis for protein interaction networks that determine the functional state of a cell. We and others have previously shown that chromatographic fractionation of native protein complexes in combination with bottom-up mass spectrometric analysis of consecutive fractions supports the multiplexed characterization and detection of state-specific changes of protein complexes. In this study, we extend co-fractionation and mass spectrometric data analysis to perform quantitative, network-based studies of proteome organization, via the size-exclusion chromatography algorithmic toolkit (SECAT). This framework explicitly accounts for the dynamic nature and rewiring of protein complexes across multiple cell states and samples, thus, elucidating molecular mechanisms that are differentially implemented across different experimental settings. Systematic analysis of multiple datasets shows that SECAT represents a highly scalable and effective methodology to assess condition/state-specific protein-network state.

However, so far only a few heritable traits with medium-to-high penetrance have been identified. The vast majority of the discovered variants only leads to disease in combination with other still unknown factors. Furthermore, while many studies aimed to link the effect of SNPs to changes in molecular phenotypes, the analysis has been often focused on testing associations between a single SNP and a transcript, hence disregarding the dysregulation of gene regulatory networks that has been shown to play an essential role in disease onset, notably in cancer. Here we take a systems biology approach and develop GVITamIN (Genetic VarIaTIoN functional analysis tool), a new statistical and computational approach to characterize the effect of a SNP on both genes and transcriptional regulatory programs. GVITamIN exploits a novel statistical approach to combine the usually small effect of disease-susceptibility SNPs, and reveals important potential oncogenic mechanisms, hence taking one step further in the direction of understanding the SNP mechanism of action. We apply GVITamIN on a breast cancer cohort and identify well-known cancer-related transcription factors, such as CTCF, LEF1, and FOXA1, as TFs dysregulated by breast cancer-associated SNPs. Furthermore, our results reveal that SNPs located on the RAD51B gene are significantly associated with an abnormal regulatory activity, suggesting a pivotal role for homologous recombination repair mechanisms in breast cancer.", "Keywords": ["SNP mechanism of action", "breast cancer", "cancer-susceptibility SNP", "multi-omics integration", "nonparametric hypothesis test", "p-value combination", "transcription factor dysregulation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "An-Phi", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "IBM Research-Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Nicoletti", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Damien", "Last Name": "Arnol", "Affiliation": "IBM Research-Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mar\u00eda", "Last Name": "Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32614991", "Title": "Generation of pralatrexate resistant T-cell lymphoma lines reveals two patterns of acquired drug resistance that is overcome with epigenetic modifiers.", "Abstract": "While pralatrexate (PDX) has been successfully developed for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, the mechanistic basis for its T-cell selectivity and acquired resistance remains elusive. In an effort to potentially identify synergistic combinations that might circumnavigate or delay acquired PDX resistance, we generated resistant cells lines over a broad concentration range. PDX-resistant cell lines H9-12 and H9-200 were developed, each exhibiting an IC50 of 35 and over 1000\u2009nM, respectively. These lines were established in vitro from parental H9 cells. Expression analysis of the proteins known to be important determinants of antifolate pharmacology revealed increase expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) due to gene amplification, and reduced folate carrier1 downregulation, as the putative mechanisms of resistance in H9-12 and H9-200 cells. Cross resistance was only seen with methotrexate but not with romidepsin, azacitidine (AZA), decitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, or bortezomib. Resistance to PDX was reversed by pretreatment with hypomethylating agents in a concentration-dependent fashion. Comparison of gene expression profiles of parental and resistant cell lines confirmed markedly different patterns of gene expression, and identified the dual specificity phosphatase four (DUSP4) as one of the molecular target of PDX activity. Reduced STAT5 phosphorylation following exposure to PDX was observed in the H9 but not in the H9-12 and H9-200 cells. These data suggest that combination with hypomethylating agents could be potent, and that DUSP4 and STAT5 could represent putative biomarkers of PDX activity.", "Keywords": ["T-cell lymphoma", "pralatrexate", "resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Aminopterin", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA Methylation", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Dual-Specificity Phosphatases", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Lymphoma, T-Cell", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases", "STAT5 Transcription Factor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Scotto", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Kinahan", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beatrice", "Last Name": "Casadei", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Mangone", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eugene", "Last Name": "Douglass", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vundavalli V", "Last Name": "Murty", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Enrica", "Last Name": "Marchi", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Changchun", "Last Name": "George", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Montanari", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen A", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes, chromosomes & cancer", "PubDate": "2020Nov"}, {"PMID": "32612149", "Title": "Mesenchymal subtype neuroblastomas are addicted to TGF-\u03b2R2/HMGCR-driven protein geranylgeranylation.", "Abstract": "The identification of targeted agents with high therapeutic index is a major challenge for cancer drug discovery.

Treatment with lovastatin, a mevalonate biosynthesis inhibitor, selectively inhibited protein prenylation and induced apoptosis in MESN cells, while having little effect in MYCNA lines. Statin sensitivity was driven by HMGCR expression, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, which correlated with statin sensitivity across NBL cell lines, thus providing a drug sensitivity biomarker.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins-whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of coronavirus-infected cells-presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature.

CAFs constitute a diverse cell population consisting of several recently described subtypes, although the extent of CAF heterogeneity has remained undefined. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to thoroughly characterize the neoplastic and tumor microenvironment content of human and mouse PDAC tumors. We corroborate the presence of myofibroblastic CAFs and inflammatory CAFs and define their unique gene signatures in vivo. Moreover, we describe a new population of CAFs that express MHC class II and CD74, but do not express classic costimulatory molecules. We term this cell population \"antigen-presenting CAFs\" and find that they activate CD4+ T cells in an antigen-specific fashion in a model system, confirming their putative immune-modulatory capacity. Our cross-species analysis paves the way for investigating distinct functions of CAF subtypes in PDAC immunity and progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Appreciating the full spectrum of fibroblast heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is crucial to developing therapies that specifically target tumor-promoting CAFs. This work identifies MHC class II-expressing CAFs with a capacity to present antigens to CD4+ T cells, and potentially to modulate the immune response in pancreatic tumors.See related commentary by Belle and DeNardo, p. 1001.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 983.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Humans", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ela", "Last Name": "Elyada", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mohan", "Last Name": "Bolisetty", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Pasquale", "Last Name": "Laise", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "William F", "Last Name": "Flynn", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Elise T", "Last Name": "Courtois", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Burkhart", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Teinor", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Pascal", "Last Name": "Belleau", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Giulia", "Last Name": "Biffi", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Lucito", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Santhosh", "Last Name": "Sivajothi", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Todd D", "Last Name": "Armstrong", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Dannielle D", "Last Name": "Engle", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth H", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher L", "Last Name": "Wolfgang", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Youngkyu", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Preall", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Jaffee", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Robson", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut. dtuveson@cshl.edu paul.robson@jax.org."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Tuveson", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. dtuveson@cshl.edu paul.robson@jax.org."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "30996079", "Title": "Resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer mediated by a reversible drug-tolerant state.", "Abstract": "Eradicating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a critical unmet clinical need. In this study, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-na\u00efve TNBC and serial biopsies from TNBC patients undergoing NACT were used to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in the neoadjuvant setting. Barcode-mediated clonal tracking and genomic sequencing of PDX tumors revealed that residual tumors remaining after treatment with standard frontline chemotherapies, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) combined with cyclophosphamide (AC), maintained the subclonal architecture of untreated tumors, yet their transcriptomes, proteomes, and histologic features were distinct from those of untreated tumors. Once treatment was halted, residual tumors gave rise to AC-sensitive tumors with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and histological features to those of untreated tumors. Together, these results demonstrated that tumors can adopt a reversible drug-tolerant state that does not involve clonal selection as an AC resistance mechanism. Serial biopsies obtained from patients with TNBC undergoing NACT revealed similar histologic changes and maintenance of stable subclonal architecture, demonstrating that AC-treated PDXs capture molecular features characteristic of human TNBC chemoresistance. Last, pharmacologic inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using an inhibitor currently in phase 1 clinical development delayed residual tumor regrowth. Thus, AC resistance in treatment-na\u00efve TNBC can be mediated by nonselective mechanisms that confer a reversible chemotherapy-tolerant state with targetable vulnerabilities.", "Keywords": [],

pathogenesis of cancer, to date there have been few functional oncogenic fusions identified involving the AKT genes. A 12-year-old female with a histopathologically indeterminate epithelioid neoplasm was found to harbor a novel fusion between the LAMTOR1 and AKT1 genes. Through expanded use access, she became the first pediatric patient to be treated with the oral ATP-competitive pan-AKT inhibitor ipatasertib. Treatment resulted in dramatic tumor regression, demonstrating through patient-driven discovery that the fusion resulted in activation of AKT1, was an oncogenic driver, and could be therapeutically targeted with clinical benefit. Post-clinical validation using patient-derived model systems corroborated these findings, confirmed a membrane-bound and constitutively active fusion protein, and identified potential mechanisms of resistance to single-agent treatment with ipatasertib. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes the patient-driven discovery of the first AKT1 fusion-driven cancer and its treatment with the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib. Patient-derived in vitro and in vivo model systems are used to confirm the LAMTOR1-AKT1 fusion as a tumorigenic driver and identify potential mechanisms of resistance to AKT inhibition.This article is

Previously, such signaling pathway models are largely based on the compilation of literature data from heterogeneous cellular contexts. Indeed, de novo reconstruction of signaling interactions from large-scale molecular profiling is still lagging, compared to similar efforts in transcriptional and protein-protein interaction networks. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm for the systematic inference of protein kinase pathways, and applied it to published mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine profile data from 250 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. The resulting network includes 43 TKs and 415 inferred, LUAD-specific substrates, which were validated at >60% accuracy by SILAC assays, including \"novel' substrates of the EGFR and c-MET TKs, which play a critical oncogenic role in lung cancer. This systematic, data-driven model supported drug response prediction on an individual sample basis, including accurate prediction and validation of synergistic EGFR and c-MET inhibitor activity in cells lacking mutations in either gene, thus contributing to current precision oncology efforts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Algorithms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Peptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proteome", "Reproducibility of Results", "Reverse Genetics", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Stem Cell Assay"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mukesh", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Psychogenics Inc., Paramus, New Jersey, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Peyton", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Manjunath", "Last Name": "Kustagi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Archana", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Comb", "Affiliation": "Cell Signaling Technology, 3 Trask Lane, Danvers, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "Minna", "Affiliation": "Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, Departments of Pharmacology, and Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30518758", "Title": "NSD2 is a conserved driver of metastatic prostate cancer progression.", "Abstract": "Deciphering cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastasis progression in vivo is essential to identify novel therapeutic approaches.

Furthermore, expression of these immunoregulatory genes is similarly increased in human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 expression. We further show that induction of prostatitis in Nkx3.1 mutant mice accelerates prostate cancer initiation, which is coincident with aberrant cellular plasticity and differentiation. Correspondingly, human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 have de-regulated expression of genes associated with these cellular processes.

Here, by integrating evidence from a whole-genome shRNA library screen and the computational inference of master regulator proteins, we identify transcription factor activating protein 4 (TFAP4) as a critical effector of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma, providing a novel synthetic lethal target. We demonstrate that TFAP4 is a direct target of MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, and that its expression and activity strongly negatively correlate with neuroblastoma patient survival. Silencing TFAP4 selectively inhibits MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, in xenograft mouse models.

To test this, we studied the overlap of inferred ceRNA networks from four tumor contexts-our proposed pan-cancer ceRNA interactome (PCI). PCI was composed of interactions between genes that were co-regulated by nearly three-times as many miRNAs as other inferred ceRNA interactions. Evidence from expression-profiling datasets suggested that PCI interactions are predictive of gene expression in 12 independent tumor- and non-tumor contexts.

As a result, the molecular basis for this aggressive phenotype remains elusive. Recent progress in regulatory network analysis helped us elucidate disease-driving mechanisms downstream of genomic alterations, including recurrent chromosomal alterations. Our analysis identified three molecular subtypes of high-risk neuroblastomas, consistent with chromosomal alterations, and identified subtype-specific master regulator proteins that were conserved across independent cohorts. A 10-protein transcriptional module-centered around a TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop-emerged as the regulatory driver of the high-risk subtype associated with MYCN amplification. Silencing of either gene collapsed MYCN-amplified (MYCNAmp) neuroblastoma transcriptional hallmarks and abrogated viability in vitro and in vivo Consistently, TEAD4 emerged as a robust prognostic marker of poor survival, with activity independent of the canonical Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. These results suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the large subset of MYCN-deregulated neuroblastomas.Significance: Despite progress in understanding of neuroblastoma genetics, little progress has been made toward personalized treatment. Here, we present a framework to determine the downstream effectors of the genetic alterations sustaining neuroblastoma subtypes, which can be easily extended to other tumor types. We show the critical effect of disrupting a 10-protein module centered around a YAP/TAZ-independent TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop in MYCNAmp neuroblastomas, nominating TEAD4 as a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention.

Here we describe an auto-/paracrine physiologic circuit that controls quiescence of MB-HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors marked by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc). Committed Hdc+ myeloid cells lie in close anatomical proximity to MB-HSCs and produce histamine, which activates the H2 receptor on MB-HSCs to promote their quiescence and self-renewal. Depleting histamine-producing cells enforces cell cycle entry, induces loss of serial transplant capacity, and sensitizes animals to chemotherapeutic injury. Increasing demand for myeloid cells via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment specifically recruits MB-HSCs and progenitors into the cell cycle; cycling MB-HSCs fail to revert into quiescence in the absence of histamine feedback, leading to their depletion, while an H2 agonist protects MB-HSCs from depletion after sepsis. Thus, histamine couples lineage-specific physiological demands to intrinsically primed MB-HSCs to enforce homeostasis.", "Keywords": ["H2 receptor", "bone marrow niche", "hematopoietic stem cells", "histamine", "histidine decarboxylase", "myeloid biased", "quiescence", "self-renewal"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Flow Cytometry", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Histamine", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice", "Myeloid Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA;

Here, we reverse engineered and interrogated\u00a0a breast cancer-specific transcriptional interaction network (interactome) to define transcriptional control structures causally responsible\u00a0for regulating genetic programs underlying breast cancer metastasis in individual patients. Our analyses confirmed established pro-metastatic\u00a0transcription factors, and they uncovered TRIM25 as a key regulator of metastasis-related transcriptional programs. Further, in\u00a0vivo analyses\u00a0established TRIM25 as a potent regulator\u00a0of\u00a0metastatic disease and poor survival outcome. Our findings suggest that identifying and targeting keystone proteins, like TRIM25, can\u00a0effectively collapse transcriptional hierarchies\u00a0necessary for metastasis formation, thus representing an innovative cancer intervention strategy.", "Keywords": ["ARACNe", "EFP", "MARINa", "TRIM25", "VIPER", "breast", "cancer", "metastasis", "transcription"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Genes, Reporter", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Luciferases", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Signal Transduction", "Survival Analysis", "Systems Biology", "Transcription Factors", "Tripartite Motif Proteins", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Logan A", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariano J", "Last Name": "Alvarez", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; DarwinHealth, Inc., New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erich Y", "Last Name": "Sabio", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marsha", "Last Name": "Reyngold", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vladimir", "Last Name": "Makarov", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suranjit", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ken-Wing", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexis", "Last Name": "Desrichard", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "\u015eevin", "Last Name": "Turcan", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin G", "Last Name": "Dalin", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vinagolu K", "Last Name": "Rajasekhar", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shuibing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda T", "Last Name": "Vahdat", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Although we have shown that the combined activities of the class I PI3K isoforms p110\u03b3 and p110\u03b4 play a major role in the development and progression of PTEN-null T-ALL, it has yet to be determined whether their contribution to leukemogenic programing is unique from that associated with NOTCH1 activation. Using an Lmo2-driven mouse model of T-ALL in which both the PI3K/AKT and NOTCH1 pathways are aberrantly upregulated, we now demonstrate that the combined activities of PI3K\u03b3/\u03b4 have both overlapping and distinct roles from NOTCH1 in generating T-ALL disease signature and in promoting tumor cell growth. Treatment of diseased animals with either a dual PI3K\u03b3/\u03b4 or a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor reduced tumor burden, prolonged survival, and induced proapoptotic pathways. Consistent with their similar biological effects, both inhibitors downregulated genes involved in cMYC-dependent metabolism in gene set enrichment analyses. Furthermore, overexpression of cMYC in mice or T-ALL cell lines conferred resistance to both inhibitors, suggesting a point of pathway convergence. Of note, interrogation of transcriptional regulators and analysis of mitochondrial function showed that PI3K\u03b3/\u03b4 activity played a greater role in supporting the disease signature and critical bioenergetic pathways.

Mesenchymal identity in GBM has been associated with a comparatively unfavorable prognosis, primarily due to inherent resistance of these tumors to current therapies. The identification of molecular determinants of mesenchymal transformation could potentially allow for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 18 (ZBTB18/ZNF238/RP58) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a crucial role in brain development and neuronal differentiation. Here, ZBTB18 is primarily silenced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM through aberrant promoter methylation. Loss of ZBTB18 contributes to the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma through regulation of poor prognosis-associated signatures. Restitution of ZBTB18 expression reverses the phenotype and impairs tumor-forming ability. These results indicate that ZBTB18 functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM through the regulation of genes associated with phenotypically aggressive properties.Implications: This study characterizes the role of the putative tumor suppressor ZBTB18 and its regulation by promoter hypermethylation, which appears to be a common mechanism to silence ZBTB18 in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and provides a new mechanistic opportunity to specifically target this tumor subclass.

We use three such master regulators (FOXA1, NKX3.1 and androgen receptor, AR) in a primed conversion strategy starting from mouse fibroblasts, resulting in prostate tissue grafts with appropriate histological and molecular properties that respond to androgen-deprivation.

Model of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.", "Abstract": "Current treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that target androgen receptor (AR) signaling improve patient survival, yet ultimately fail. Here, we provide novel insights into treatment response for the antiandrogen abiraterone by analyses of a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with combined inactivation of Trp53 and Pten, which are frequently comutated in human CRPC. These NPp53 mice fail to respond to abiraterone and display accelerated progression to tumors resembling treatment-related CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) in humans. Cross-species computational analyses identify master regulators of adverse response that are conserved with human CRPC-NE, including the neural differentiation factor SOX11, which promotes neuroendocrine differentiation in cells derived from NPp53 tumors. Furthermore, abiraterone-treated NPp53 prostate tumors contain regions of focal and/or overt neuroendocrine differentiation, distinguished by their proliferative potential. Notably, lineage tracing in vivo provides definitive and quantitative evidence that focal and overt neuroendocrine regions arise by transdifferentiation of luminal adenocarcinoma cells. These findings underscore principal roles for TP53 and PTEN inactivation in abiraterone resistance and progression from adenocarcinoma to CRPC-NE by transdifferentiation.Significance: Understanding adverse treatment response and identifying patients likely to fail treatment represent fundamental clinical challenges. By integrating analyses of GEM models and human clinical data, we provide direct genetic evidence for transdifferentiation as a mechanism of drug resistance as well as for stratifying patients for treatment with antiandrogens.

Here, we sought to characterize the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGFR TKI treatment of mutant EGFR-driven human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with varying sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and afatinib. We employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify and quantify tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. The proportion of tyrosine phosphorylated sites that had reduced phosphorylation upon erlotinib or afatinib treatment correlated with the degree of TKI-sensitivity. Afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, more effectively inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of a majority of the substrates. The phosphosites with phosphorylation SILAC ratios that correlated with the TKI-sensitivity of the cell lines include sites on kinases, such as EGFR-Y1197 and MAPK7-Y221, and adaptor proteins, such as SHC1-Y349/350, ERRFI1-Y394, GAB1-Y689, STAT5A-Y694, DLG3-Y705, and DAPP1-Y139, suggesting these are potential biomarkers of TKI sensitivity. DAPP1, is a novel target of mutant EGFR signaling and Y-139 is the major site of DAPP1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also uncovered several off-target effects of these TKIs, such as MST1R-Y1238/Y1239 and MET-Y1252/1253.

Although these aggressive traits have been associated with phenotypic heterogeneity, our understanding of this association remains incomplete. To fill this knowledge gap, we inferred a set of 33 transcription factors (TF) associated with gene signatures of the known neuroendocrine/epithelial (NE) and non-neuroendocrine/mesenchymal-like (ML) SCLC phenotypes. The topology of this SCLC TF network was derived from prior knowledge and was simulated using Boolean modeling. These simulations predicted that the network settles into attractors, or TF expression patterns, that correlate with NE or ML phenotypes, suggesting that TF network dynamics underlie the emergence of heterogeneous SCLC phenotypes. However, several cell lines and patient tumor specimens failed to correlate with either the NE or ML attractors. By flow cytometry, single cells within these cell lines simultaneously expressed surface markers of both NE and ML differentiation, confirming the existence of a \"hybrid\" phenotype. Upon exposure to standard-of-care cytotoxic drugs or epigenetic modifiers, NE and ML cell populations converged toward the hybrid state, suggesting possible escape from treatment. Our findings indicate that SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity can be specified dynamically by attractor states of a master regulatory TF network. Thus, SCLC heterogeneity may be best understood as states within an epigenetic landscape. Understanding phenotypic transitions within this landscape may provide insights to clinical applications.

Similar to other members of the MYC family of oncoproteins, MYCN (also known as N-Myc) is a transcription factor, and its stability and activity are tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that N-Myc is a driver of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, therapies that directly suppress N-Myc activity in human tumors are limited. Here we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7; also known as HAUSP) as a regulator of N-Myc function in neuroblastoma. HAUSP interacts with N-Myc, and HAUSP expression induces deubiquitination and subsequent stabilization of N-Myc. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of USP7 in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines, or genetic ablation of Usp7 in the mouse brain, destabilizes N-Myc, which leads to inhibition of N-Myc function. Notably, HAUSP is more abundant in patients with neuroblastoma who have poorer prognosis, and HAUSP expression substantially correlates with N-Myc transcriptional activity. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors of HAUSP's deubiquitinase activity markedly suppress the growth of MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cell lines in xenograft mouse models.

In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Pharmaceutical", "Databases, Protein", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Protein Structure, Tertiary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mariano J", "Last Name": "Alvarez", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Federico M", "Last Name": "Giorgi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Lachmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "B Belinda", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "B Hilda", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature genetics", "PubDate": "2016Aug"}, {"PMID": "27153732", "Title": "Detection and removal of spatial bias in multiwell assays.", "Abstract": "Multiplex readout assays are now increasingly being performed using microfluidic automation in multiwell format.

In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation.

CpG methylation is a central mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation affecting cancer-related genes, and occurs early in gastric carcinogenesis. DNA samples from non-metaplastic gastric mucosa with variable levels of gastritis (non-metaplastic mucosa), intestinal metaplasia, or gastric cancer were screened with methylation arrays for CpG methylation of cancer-related genes and 30 gene targets were further characterized by high-definition bisulfite next-generation sequencing. In addition, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed for correlation of methylation with gene expression. Overall, 13 genes had significantly increased CpG methylation in gastric cancer vs non-metaplastic mucosa (BRINP1, CDH11, CHFR, EPHA5, EPHA7, FGF2, FLI1, GALR1, HS3ST2, PDGFRA, SEZ6L, SGCE, and SNRPN). Further, most of these genes had corresponding reduced expression levels in gastric cancer compared with intestinal metaplasia, including novel hypermethylated genes in gastric cancer (FLI1, GALR1, SGCE, and SNRPN), suggesting that they may regulate neoplastic transformation from non-malignant intestinal metaplasia to cancer. Our data suggest a tumor-suppressor role for FLI1 in gastric cancer, consistent with recently reported data in breast cancer. For the genes with strongest methylation/expression correlation, namely FLI1, the expression was lowest in microsatellite-unstable tumors compared with other gastric cancer molecular subtypes. Importantly, reduced expression of hypermethylated BRINP1 and SGCE was significantly associated with favorable survival in gastric cancer. In summary, we report novel methylation gene targets that may have functional roles in discrete stages of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Computational Biology", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Databases, Genetic", "Disease Progression", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Mucosa", "Gastritis", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Metaplasia", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Stomach Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jorge L", "Last Name": "Sepulveda", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jorge L", "Last Name": "Gutierrez-Pajares", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aesis", "Last Name": "Luna", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Tobias", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanghee", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Federico", "Last Name": "Giorgi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena V", "Last Name": "Komissarova", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonia R", "Last Name": "Sepulveda", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc", "PubDate": "2016Feb"}, {"PMID": "26735018", "Title": "An ID2-dependent mechanism for VHL inactivation in cancer.", "Abstract": "Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumour progression.

However, the pathways that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2\u03b1 accumulation in CSCs have remained unclear. Here we report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on threonine 27 (Thr27). Hypoxia downregulates this phosphorylation via inactivation of DYRK1A and DYRK1B. The activity of these kinases is stimulated in normoxia by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 (also known as EGLN2). ID2 binds to the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin 2, and impairs HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of Thr27 of ID2 by DYRK1 blocks ID2-VHL interaction and preserves HIF2\u03b1 ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma, ID2 positively modulates HIF2\u03b1 activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1 phosphorylates Thr27 of ID2, leading to HIF2\u03b1 destabilization, loss of glioma stemness, inhibition of tumour growth, and a more favourable outcome for patients with glioblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cullin Proteins", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases", "Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2", "Male", "Mice", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Oxygen", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphothreonine", "Protein Binding", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Ubiquitination", "Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "Dyrk Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sang Bae", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Veronique", "Last Name": "Frattini", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mukesh", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelica M", "Last Name": "Castano", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Sherman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine, New York 10014, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keino", "Last Name": "Hutchinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine, New York 10014, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangchao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Cardozo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine, New York 10014, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Iavarone", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Lasorella", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2016Jan14"}, {"PMID": "26643555", "Title": "HDAC6 activity is a non-oncogene addiction hub for inflammatory breast cancers.", "Abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal form of breast cancers with a 5-year survival rate of only 40\u00a0%.

However, in 20% to 60% of follicular lymphoma patients, transformation to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) reduces median survival to only 1.2 years. The specific functional and genetic determinants of follicular lymphoma transformation remain elusive, and genomic alterations underlying disease advancement have only been identified for a subset of cases. Therefore, to identify candidate drivers of follicular lymphoma transformation, we performed systematic analysis of a B-cell-specific regulatory model exhibiting follicular lymphoma transformation signatures using the Master Regulator Inference algorithm (MARINa). This analysis revealed FOXM1, TFDP1, ATF5, HMGA1, and NFYB to be candidate master regulators (MR) contributing to disease progression. Accordingly, validation was achieved through synthetic lethality assays in which RNAi-mediated silencing of MRs individually or in combination reduced the viability of (14;18)-positive DLBCL (t-DLBCL) cells. Furthermore, specific combinations of small-molecule compounds targeting synergistic MR pairs induced loss of viability in t-DLBCL cells.

Both are characterized by distinctive blistering lesions and significant mortality rates. While there is evidence for strong drug-specific genetic predisposition related to HLA alleles, recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) on European and Asian populations have failed to identify genetic susceptibility alleles that are common across multiple drugs. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the low to moderate effect size of individual genetic risk factors. To test this hypothesis we developed Pointer, a new algorithm that assesses the aggregate effect of multiple low risk variants on a pathway using a gene set enrichment approach. A key advantage of our method is the capability to associate SNPs with genes by exploiting physical proximity as well as by using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that capture information about both cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects. We control for known bias-inducing aspects of enrichment based analyses, such as: 1) gene length, 2) gene set size, 3) presence of biologically related genes within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and, 4) genes shared among multiple gene sets. We applied this approach to publicly available SJS/TEN genome-wide genotype data and identified the ABC transporter and Proteasome pathways as potentially implicated in the genetic susceptibility of non-drug-specific SJS/TEN. We demonstrated that the innovative SNP-to-gene mapping phase of the method was essential in detecting the significant enrichment for those pathways. Analysis of an independent gene expression dataset provides supportive functional evidence for the involvement of Proteasome pathways in SJS/TEN cutaneous lesions. These results suggest that Pointer provides a useful framework for the integrative analysis of pharmacogenetic GWAS data, by increasing the power to detect aggregate effects of multiple low risk variants.

Our understanding of this disease would thus benefit from an approach that addresses this complexity by elucidating the regulatory networks that are dysregulated in the neural compartment of AD patients, across distinct brain regions. Here, we use a Systems Biology (SB) approach, which has been highly successful in the dissection of cancer related phenotypes, to reverse engineer the transcriptional regulation layer of human neuronal cells and interrogate it to infer candidate Master Regulators (MRs) responsible for disease progression. Analysis of gene expression profiles from laser-captured neurons from AD and controls subjects, using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe), yielded an interactome consisting of 488,353 transcription-factor/target interactions. Interrogation of this interactome, using the Master Regulator INference algorithm (MARINa), identified an unbiased set of candidate MRs causally responsible for regulating the transcriptional signature of AD progression. Experimental assays in autopsy-derived human brain tissue showed that three of the top candidate MRs (YY1, p300 and ZMYM3) are indeed biochemically and histopathologically dysregulated in AD brains compared to controls. Our results additionally implicate p53 and loss of acetylation homeostasis in the neurodegenerative process. This study suggests that an integrative, SB approach can be applied to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and provide significant novel insight on the disease progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Soline", "Last Name": "Aubry", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease & the Aging Brain and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Crary", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease & the Aging Brain and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Lefort", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease & the Aging Brain and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yasir H", "Last Name": "Qureshi", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease & the Aging Brain and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Celine", "Last Name": "Lefebvre", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Inserm Unit U981, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805, Villejuif, France."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America; Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease & the Aging Brain and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25608936", "Title": "A systems approach to drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "In the articles included in this volume, one feels a strong frustration among the writers with the slow course of therapeutics development for Alzheimer's disease and with the clinical failure of targeted therapeutic agents despite substantial progress in our understanding of the biology and biochemistry of the disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Systems Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA, mls7@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Soline", "Last Name": "Aubry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariano J", "Last Name": "Alvarez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "PubDate": "2015Jan"}, {"PMID": "25527096", "Title": "The Cyni framework for network inference in Cytoscape.", "Abstract": "Research on methods for the inference of networks from biological data is making significant advances, but the adoption of network inference in biomedical research practice is lagging behind.

Another perspective suggests a more complexly regulated state involving competition between multiple lineage-specifying TFs that define pluripotency. These contrasting views were developed from extensive analyses of TFs in pluripotent cells in vitro. An experimentally validated, genome-wide repertoire of the regulatory interactions that control pluripotency within the in vivo cellular contexts is yet to be developed. To address this limitation, we assembled a TF interactome of adult human male germ cell tumors (GCTs) using the Algorithm for the Accurate Reconstruction of Cellular Pathways (ARACNe) to analyze gene expression profiles of 141 tumors comprising pluripotent and differentiated subsets. The network (GCT(Net)) comprised 1,305 TFs, and its ingenuity pathway analysis identified pluripotency and embryonal development as the top functional pathways. We experimentally validated GCT(Net) by functional (silencing) and biochemical (ChIP-seq) analysis of the core pluripotency regulatory TFs POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 in relation to their targets predicted by ARACNe. To define the extent of the in vivo pluripotency network in this system, we ranked all TFs in the GCT(Net) according to sharing of ARACNe-predicted targets with those of POU5F1 and NANOG using an odds-ratio analysis method. To validate this network, we silenced the top 10 TFs in the network in H9 embryonic stem cells.

Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of this microRNA cluster is regulated by TGF-\u03b2, a well-characterized regulator of mammary involution. Overall, our data suggest a model in which activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway after weaning induces the transcription of miR-424(322)/503, which in turn down-regulates the expression of key genes.

To this end, reverse engineering approaches have been used to systematically dissect regulatory interactions in a specific tissue, based on the availability of large molecular profile datasets, thus improving our mechanistic understanding of complex diseases, such as cancer. In this paper, we introduce high-order Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Network (hARACNe), an extension of the ARACNe algorithm for the dissection of transcriptional regulatory networks. ARACNe uses the data processing inequality (DPI), from information theory, to detect and prune indirect interactions that are unlikely to be mediated by an actual physical interaction. Whereas ARACNe considers only first-order indirect interactions, i.e. those mediated by only one extra regulator, hARACNe considers a generalized form of indirect interactions via two, three or more other regulators. We show that use of higher-order DPI resulted in significantly improved performance, based on transcription factor (TF)-specific ChIP-chip data, as well as on gene expression profile following RNAi-mediated TF silencing.", "Keywords": ["ARACNe", "higher-order data processing inequality", "information theory", "reverse engineering", "transcriptional regulatory network"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "In Sock", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Sage Bionetworks , 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109 , USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Margolin", "Affiliation": "Sage Bionetworks , 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109 , USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Biomedical Informatics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center , Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY 10032 , USA."}], "Journal": "Interface focus", "PubDate": "2013Aug06"}, {"PMID": "24440720", "Title": "ZFHX4 interacts with the NuRD core member CHD4 and regulates the glioblastoma tumor-initiating cell state.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors subpopulations of therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that are self-renewing and multipotent.

ZFHX4 is required to maintain TIC-associated and normal human neural precursor cell phenotypes in\u00a0vitro, suggesting that ZFHX4 regulates differentiation, and its suppression increases glioma-free survival in intracranial xenografts.

Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Animals", "Dexamethasone", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring", "Humans", "Mice", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Phosphorylation", "Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erich", "Last Name": "Piovan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiyang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Tosello", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Herranz", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Ambesi-Impiombato", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana Carolina", "Last Name": "Da Silva", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Martin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Perez-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isaura", "Last Name": "Rigo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mireia", "Last Name": "Castillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Indraccolo", "Affiliation": "UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Justin R", "Last Name": "Cross", "Affiliation": "Donald B. and Catherine C.

Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases.

To gain insight into how FOXOs select specific genes for regulation, we performed a screen for genes that modify FOXO activation of TRAIL, a death receptor ligand capable of inducing extrinsic apoptosis. We discovered that the bZIP transcriptional repressor NFIL3 (nuclear factor interleukin 3-regulated) hindered FOXO transcription factor access to chromatin at the TRAIL promoter by binding to nearby DNA and recruiting histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) to reduce histone acetylation. In the same manner, NFIL3 repressed expression of certain FOXO targets--e.g., FAS, GADD45\u03b1 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible, \u03b1), and GADD45\u03b2--but not others. NFIL3, which we found to be overexpressed in different cancers, supported tumor cell survival largely through repression of TRAIL and antagonized hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. Moreover, its expression in cancer was associated with lower patient survival.
