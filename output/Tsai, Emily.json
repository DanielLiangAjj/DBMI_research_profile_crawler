[{"PMID": "37167361", "Title": "Cell-Specific Mechanisms in the Heart of COVID-19 Patients.", "Abstract": "From the onset of the pandemic, evidence of cardiac involvement in acute COVID-19 abounded. Cardiac presentations ranged from arrhythmias to ischemia, myopericarditis/myocarditis, ventricular dysfunction to acute heart failure, and even cardiogenic shock. Elevated serum cardiac troponin levels were prevalent among hospitalized patients with COVID-19; the higher the magnitude of troponin elevation, the greater the COVID-19 illness severity and in-hospital death risk. Whether these consequences were due to direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiac cells or secondary to inflammatory responses steered early cardiac autopsy studies. SARS-CoV-2 was reportedly detected in endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and within the extracellular space. However, findings were inconsistent and different methodologies had their limitations. Initial autopsy reports suggested that SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was common, setting off studies to find and phenotype inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Nonetheless, subsequent studies rarely detected myocarditis. Microthrombi, cardiomyocyte necrosis, and inflammatory infiltrates without cardiomyocyte damage were much more common. In vitro and ex vivo experimental platforms have assessed the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and elucidated mechanisms of viral entry into and replication within cardiac cells. Data point to pericytes as the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart. Infection of pericytes can account for the observed pericyte and endothelial cell death, innate immune response, and immunothrombosis commonly observed in COVID-19 hearts. These processes are bidirectional and synergistic, rendering a definitive order of events elusive. Single-cell/nucleus analyses of COVID-19 myocardial tissue and isolated cardiac cells have provided granular data about the cellular composition and cell type-specific transcriptomic signatures of COVID-19 and microthrombi-positive COVID-19 hearts. Still, much remains unknown and more in vivo studies are needed. This review seeks to provide an overview of the current understanding of COVID-19 cardiac pathophysiology. Cell type-specific mechanisms and the studies that provided such insights will be highlighted. Given the unprecedented pace of COVID-19 research, more mechanistic details are sure to emerge since the writing of this review. Importantly, our current knowledge offers significant clues about the cardiac pathophysiology of long COVID-19, the increased postrecovery risk of cardiac events, and thus, the future landscape of cardiovascular disease.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "endothelial cells", "myocardium", "pericytes", "single-cell analysis", "thromboinflammation", "viral tropism"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "Myocarditis", "Endothelial Cells", "Hospital Mortality", "Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome", "Heart", "Heart Diseases", "Troponin", "Myocytes, Cardiac"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY (E.J.T.)."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "C\u02c7ih\u00e1kov\u00e1", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD (D.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Nathan R", "Last Name": "Tucker", "Affiliation": "Masonic Medical Research Institute, Utica, NY (N.R.T.)."}], "Journal": "Circulation research", "PubDate": "2023May12"}, {"PMID": "36897483", "Title": "How Does COVID-19 Affect the Heart?", "Abstract": "Cardiac consequences occur in both\u00a0acute COVID-19\u00a0and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).

In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

cardiac injury is prevalent in critical COVID-19 and associated with increased mortality. Its etiology remains debated, as initially presumed causes - myocarditis and cardiac necrosis - have proved uncommon. To elucidate the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, we conducted a prospective study of the first 69 consecutive COVID-19 decedents at CUIMC in New York City. Of 6 acute cardiac histopathologic features, presence of microthrombi was the most commonly detected among our cohort. We tested associations of cardiac microthrombi with biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and fibrinolysis and with in-hospital antiplatelet therapy, therapeutic anticoagulation, and corticosteroid treatment, while adjusting for multiple clinical factors, including COVID-19 therapies. Higher peak erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were independently associated with increased odds of microthrombi, supporting an immunothrombotic etiology. Using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing analysis on 3 patients with and 4 patients without cardiac microthrombi, we discovered an enrichment of prothrombotic/antifibrinolytic, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune-potentiating signaling among cardiac fibroblasts in microthrombi-positive, relative to microthrombi-negative, COVID-19 hearts. Non-COVID-19, nonfailing hearts were used as reference controls. Our study identifies a specific transcriptomic signature in cardiac fibroblasts as a salient feature of microthrombi-positive COVID-19 hearts. Our findings warrant further mechanistic study as cardiac fibroblasts may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19-associated cardiac microthrombi.", "Keywords": ["Bioinformatics",

Developing and testing novel therapeutics for PH requires a clinically relevant large animal model of increased pulmonary vascular resistance and RVF. This manuscript discusses the latest development of the previously published ovine PH-RVF model that utilizes left pulmonary artery (PA) ligation and main PA occlusion. This model of PH-RVF is a versatile platform to control not only the disease severity but also the RV's phenotypic response. Adult sheep (60-80 kg) underwent left PA (LPA) ligation, placement of main PA cuff, and insertion of RV pressure monitor. PA cuff and RV pressure monitor were connected to subcutaneous ports. Subjects underwent progressive PA banding twice per week for 9 weeks with sequential measures of RV pressure, PA cuff pressures, and mixed venous blood gas (SvO2). At the initiation and endpoint of this model, ventricular function and dimensions were assessed using echocardiography. In a representative group of 12 animal subjects, RV mean and systolic pressure increased from 28 \u00b1 5 and 57 \u00b1 7 mmHg at week 1, respectively, to 44 \u00b1 7 and 93 \u00b1 18 mmHg (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) by week 9. Echocardiography demonstrated characteristic findings of PH-RVF, notably RV dilation, increased wall thickness, and septal bowing. The longitudinal trend of SvO2 and PA cuff pressure demonstrates that the rate of PA banding can be titrated to elicit varying RV phenotypes. A faster PA banding strategy led to a precipitous decline in SvO2 < 65%, indicating RV decompensation, whereas a slower, more paced strategy led to the maintenance of physiologic SvO2 at 70%-80%. One animal that experienced the accelerated strategy developed several liters of pleural effusion and ascites by week 9. This chronic PH-RVF model provides a valuable tool for studying molecular mechanisms, developing diagnostic biomarkers, and enabling therapeutic innovation to manage RV adaptation and maladaptation from PH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heart Failure", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Pulmonary Artery", "Sheep", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Right", "Ventricular Function, Right"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rei", "Last Name": "Ukita", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "W Kelly", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Talackine", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Cardwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Yatrik", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Clayne", "Last Name": "Benson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin T", "Last Name": "Demarest", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Erika B", "Last Name": "Rosenzweig", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University."}, {"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University; matthew.bacchetta@vumc.org."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2021Jul15"}, {"PMID": "33915568", "Title": "A molecular single-cell lung atlas of lethal COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2, but the host response at the lung tissue level is poorly understood.

Integrated analyses identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, thereby providing insight into the biology of lethal COVID-19. The lungs from individuals with COVID-19 were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages, but had impaired T cell responses. Monocyte/macrophage-derived interleukin-1\u03b2 and epithelial cell-derived interleukin-6 were unique features of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Alveolar type 2 cells adopted an inflammation-associated transient progenitor cell state and failed to undergo full transition into alveolar type 1 cells, resulting in impaired lung regeneration. Furthermore, we identified expansion of recently described CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblasts3 contributing to rapidly ensuing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19. Inference of protein activity and ligand-receptor interactions identified putative drug targets to disrupt deleterious circuits.

Novel mechanical circulatory support systems have therapeutic potential for RVF, but the development of these devices requires a large animal disease model that replicates the pathophysiology observed in humans. We previously reported an effective disease model of PH in sheep through ligation of the left pulmonary artery (PA) and progressive occlusion of the main PA. Herein, we report a case of acute decompensation with this model of chronic RVF. Gradual PA banding raised the RV pressure (maximum RV systolic/mean pressure = 95 mmHg/56 mmHg). Clinical findings and laboratory serum parameters suggested appropriate physiologic compensation for 7 weeks. However, mixed venous saturation declined precipitously on week 7, and creatinine increased markedly on week 9. By the 10th week, the animal developed dependent, subcutaneous edema. Subsequently, the animal expired during the induction of general anesthesia. Post-mortem evaluation revealed several liters of pleural effusion and ascites, RV dilatation, eccentric RV hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis. The presented case supports this model's relevance to the human pathophysiology of RVF secondary to PH and its value in the development of novel devices, therapeutics, and interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular", "Pulmonary Artery", "Sheep", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Right"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rei", "Last Name": "Ukita", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Tumen", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Pinelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Kelsey R", "Last Name": "Finnie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Talackine", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Nancy L", "Last Name": "Cardwell", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "W Kelly", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Yatrik", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York."}, {"First Name": "Erika B", "Last Name": "Rosenzweig", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York."}, {"First Name": "Keith E", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}], "Journal": "ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)", "PubDate": "2022Feb01"}, {"PMID": "33856918", "Title": "COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Bedside.", "Abstract": "A pandemic of historic impact, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has potential consequences on the cardiovascular health of millions of people who survive infection worldwide.

Progression towards right ventricular failure (RVF) can occur in spite of optimal medical treatment of HF or PH, highlighting current insufficient understanding of RVF molecular pathophysiology. To identify molecular mechanisms that may distinctly underlie RVF, we investigated the cardiac ventricular transcriptome of advanced HF patients, with and without RVF. Using an integrated systems genomic and functional biology approach, we identified an RVF-specific gene module, for which WIPI1 served as a hub and HSPB6 and MAP4 as drivers, and confirmed the ventricular specificity of Wipi1, Hspb6, and Map4 transcriptional changes in adult murine models of pressure overload induced RV- versus LV- failure. We uncovered a shift towards non-canonical autophagy in the failing RV that correlated with RV-specific Wipi1 upregulation. In vitro siRNA silencing of Wipi1 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes limited non-canonical autophagy and blunted aldosterone-induced mitochondrial superoxide levels. Our findings suggest that Wipi1 regulates mitochondrial oxidative signaling and non-canonical autophagy in cardiac myocytes. Together with our human transcriptomic analysis and corroborating studies in an RVF mouse model, these data render Wipi1 a potential target for RV-directed HF therapy.", "Keywords": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Heart failure", "Molecular biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "HSP20 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Heart Failure", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Oxidative Stress", "Primary Cell Culture", "RNA-Seq", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Right"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christos", "Last Name": "Tzimas", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christoph D", "Last Name": "Rau", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Petra E", "Last Name": "Buergisser", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gaston", "Last Name": "Jean-Louis", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Chukwuneke", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Dun", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yibin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019Apr25"}, {"PMID": "29686029", "Title": "Initial Right Ventricular Dysfunction Severity Identifies Severe Peripartum Cardiomyopathy Phenotype With Worse Early and Overall Outcomes: A 24-Year Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Outcomes in peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) vary.

Slc8b1 encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), which is proposed to be the primary mechanism for mCa2+ extrusion in excitable cells. Here we show that tamoxifen-induced deletion of Slc8b1 in adult mouse hearts causes sudden death, with less than 13% of affected mice surviving after 14 days. Lethality correlated with severe myocardial dysfunction and fulminant heart failure. Mechanistically, cardiac pathology was attributed to mCa2+ overload driving increased generation of superoxide and necrotic cell death, which was rescued by genetic inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore activation. Corroborating these findings, overexpression of NCLX in the mouse heart by conditional transgenesis had the beneficial effect of augmenting mCa2+ clearance, preventing permeability transition and protecting against ischaemia-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis and heart failure.

Methods In 172 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, we sequenced 43 genes with variants that have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared the prevalence of different variant types (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) in these women with the prevalence of such variants in persons with dilated cardiomyopathy and with population controls. Results We identified 26 distinct, rare truncating variants in eight genes among women with peripartum cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of truncating variants (26 in 172 [15%]) was significantly higher than that in a reference population of 60,706 persons (4.7%, P=1.3\u00d710(-7)) but was similar to that in a cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (55 of 332 patients [17%], P=0.81). Two thirds of identified truncating variants were in TTN, as seen in 10% of the patients and in 1.4% of the reference population (P=2.7\u00d710(-10)); almost all TTN variants were located in the titin A-band. Seven of the TTN truncating variants were previously reported in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In a clinically well-characterized cohort of 83 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, the presence of TTN truncating variants was significantly correlated with a lower ejection fraction at 1-year follow-up (P=0.005). Conclusions The distribution of truncating variants in a large series of women with peripartum cardiomyopathy was remarkably similar to that found in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
