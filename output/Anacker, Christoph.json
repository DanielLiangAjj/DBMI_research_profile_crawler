Serotonin 1A (5HT 1A ) autoreceptors in the raph\u00e9 nuclei regulate adult stress vulnerability, but if 5HT 1A could be targeted to prevent ELA effects on susceptibility to future stressors is unknown. Here, we exposed mice with postnatal knockdown of 5HT 1A autoreceptors to the limited bedding and nesting model of ELA from postnatal day (P)3-10. We then tested behavioral, neuroendocrine, neurogenic, and neuroinflammatory responses to an acute swim stress in male and female mice in adolescence (P35) and in adulthood (P56). In ELA-exposed females, adult swim stress exposure increased passive coping and despair-like behavior, corticosterone levels at baseline and after stress, and neuronal activity and corticotropin releasing hormone levels in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. ELA also reduced neurogenesis and increased microglia activation in the ventral dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus - an important mediator of individual differences in stress susceptibility. These effects of ELA were specific to females, but not males, and manifested predominantly in adulthood, but not earlier on in adolescence. Postnatal 5HT 1A autoreceptor knockdown prevented ELA effects on stress reactivity and on neurogenesis and neuroinflammation in the DG, indicating that reducing 5HT 1A autoreceptors confers resilience to ELA. Our findings demonstrate that ELA induces long-lasting and sex-specific impairments in stress reactivity and ventral DG function across development, and identify 5HT 1A autoreceptors as potential targets to prevent these persistent effects of ELA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rushell", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Malave", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rory", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serena", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Noah", "Last Name": "Sadik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan22"}, {"PMID": "38237896", "Title": "TAAR1 agonists improve glycemic control, reduce body weight and modulate neurocircuits governing energy balance and feeding.", "Abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome, which can be induced or exacerbated by current antipsychotic drugs (APDs), is highly prevalent in schizophrenia patients.

Although SSRIs targeting the serotonergic system are prescribed over 200 million times annually, they have variable therapeutic efficacy and side effects, and mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively characterise the molecular landscape of gene regulatory changes associated with fluoxetine, a widely-used SSRI. We performed multimodal analysis of SSRI response in 27 mammalian brain regions using 310 bulk RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets, followed by in-depth characterisation of two hippocampal regions using single-cell RNA-seq (20 datasets). Remarkably, fluoxetine induced profound region-specific shifts in gene expression and chromatin state, including in the nucleus accumbens shell, locus coeruleus and septal areas, as well as in more well-studied regions such as the raphe and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Expression changes were strongly enriched at GWAS loci for depression and antidepressant drug response, stressing the relevance to human phenotypes. We observed differential expression at dozens of signalling receptors and pathways, many of which are previously unknown. Single-cell analysis revealed stark differences in fluoxetine response between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyri, particularly in oligodendrocytes, mossy cells and inhibitory neurons. Across diverse brain regions, integrative omics analysis consistently suggested increased energy metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial changes, which we corroborated in vitro; this may thus constitute a shared mechanism of action of fluoxetine. Similarly, we observed pervasive chromatin remodelling signatures across the brain. Our study reveals unexpected regional and cell type-specific heterogeneity in SSRI action, highlights under-studied brain regions that may play a major role in antidepressant response, and provides a rich resource of candidate cell types, genes, gene regulatory elements and pathways for mechanistic analysis and identifying new therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antidepressive Agents", "Brain", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "Energy Metabolism", "Fluoxetine", "Mammals", "Multiomics", "Animals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nirmala Arul", "Last Name": "Rayan", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Vibhor", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Aow", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Naghmeh", "Last Name": "Rastegar", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michelle Gek Liang", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "O'Toole", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edita", "Last Name": "Aliwarga", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Danusa Mar", "Last Name": "Arcego", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hui Ting Grace", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Jen Yi", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "May Yin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Hajira Shreen", "Last Name": "Haja", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Wai Leong", "Last Name": "Tam", "Affiliation": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 138672, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Tie-Yuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Josie", "Last Name": "Diorio", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carine", "Last Name": "Parent", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Meaney", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, H4H 1R3, QC, Canada.

Brain development is particularly malleable during prenatal and early postnatal life, when complex neural circuits are being formed and refined through an interplay of excitatory and inhibitory neural input, synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, myelination, and neurogenesis. Adversity that influences these processes during sensitive periods of development can thus have long-lasting and pervasive effects on neural circuit maturation. In this review, we will discuss clinical and preclinical evidence for the impact of ELA on neural circuit formation with a focus on the early postnatal period, and how long-lasting impairments in these circuits can affect future behavior. We provide converging evidence from human and animal studies on how ELA alters the functional development of brain regions, neural circuits, and neurotransmitter systems that are crucial for cognition and affective behavior, including the hippocampus, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neural networks of fear responses and cognition, and the serotonin (5-HT) system. We also discuss how gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions can determine individual differences in susceptibility and resilience to ELA, as well as molecular pathways by which ELA regulates neural circuit development, for which we emphasize epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying ELA effects on brain function and psychopathology during early postnatal sensitive periods may have great potential to advance strategies to better treat or prevent psychiatric disorders that have their origin early in life.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Pregnancy", "Psychopathology", "Serotonin", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Malave", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

Many transgender adolescents experience gender dysphoria related to incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth. This dysphoria may worsen as puberty progresses. Puberty suppression by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), such as leuprolide, can help alleviate gender dysphoria and provide additional time before irreversible changes in secondary sex characteristics may be initiated through feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy congruent with the adolescent's gender experience. However, the effects of GnRH agonists on brain function and mental health are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of leuprolide on reproductive function, social and affective behavior, cognition, and brain activity in a rodent model. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were injected daily with saline or leuprolide (20\u2009\u03bcg) for 6 weeks and tested in several behavioral assays. We found that leuprolide increases hyperlocomotion, changes social preference, and increases neuroendocrine stress responses in male mice, while the same treatment increases hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. Neuronal hyperactivity was found in the dentate gyrus (DG) of leuprolide-treated females, but not males, consistent with the elevation in hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. These data show for the first time that GnRH agonist treatment after puberty onset exerts sex-specific effects on social- and affective behavior, stress regulation, and neural activity. Investigating the behavioral and neurobiological effects of GnRH agonists in mice will be important to better guide the investigation of potential consequences of this treatment for youth experiencing gender dysphoria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Female", "Gender Identity", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Puberty", "Transgender Persons", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] \u2264 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression \u2265 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA.

We found that chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born neurons in the vDG promotes susceptibility to social defeat stress, whereas increasing neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress. By using in vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activity from large cell populations in the vDG, we show that increased neurogenesis results in a decrease in the activity of stress-responsive cells that are active preferentially during attacks or while mice explore anxiogenic environments.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for some of the responses to SSRIs, but it is not known whether mature dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) also contribute. We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were abolished.

Here, we investigated the function of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) EP4 receptor, a vasoactive G\u03b1s-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), in rodent models of neonatal HIE. The function of PGE2 signaling through the EP4 receptor was investigated using pharmacological and conditional knockout genetic strategies in vivo in rodent models of HIE. Pharmacologic activation of the EP4 receptor with a selective agonist was significantly cerebroprotective both acutely and after 7days. Measurement of cerebral perfusion during and after hypoxia-ischemia demonstrated that EP4 receptor activation improved cerebral perfusion in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hypoxic-ischemic hemispheres. To test whether vascular EP4 signaling exerted a critical function in HIE injury, cell specific conditional knockout mouse pups were generated in which endothelial EP4 receptor was selectively deleted postnatally. VE-Cadherin Cre-ER(T2);EP4(lox/lox) pups demonstrated significant increases in cerebral injury as compared to VE-Cadherin Cre-ER(T2);EP4(+/+) control littermates, indicating that endothelial EP4 signaling is protective in HIE.

Blood was collected from patients diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder (n=15) and from healthy controls (n=19). Whole-blood reduced glutathione (GSH), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1), glutathione reductase, malondialdehyde (MDA), and methemoglobin (MetHb) and plasma H\u2082O\u2082 were assayed spectrophotometrically. The serum heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), cytokine, neopterin, and iron statuses were measured by ELISA. DNA damage was analyzed by comet assay. Serum concentrations of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor were assayed by ELISA. MetHb saturation was analyzed spectrophotometrically in red blood cell hemolysate. The erythron variables were measured using a hematological analyzer. We observed a significant decrease in GPx-1 and SOD-1 activities and decreased levels of HO-1 and GSH in depressed patients compared to controls. Conversely, compared with controls, we found increased concentrations of MDA and H\u2082O\u2082 and more DNA damage in depressed patients. Furthermore, the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and of neopterin were increased in depressed patients along with decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. A strong association between antioxidant defense, cytokine levels, and iron homeostasis was also revealed. These findings show that depression is associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and restrictions on the available iron supply for red blood cell production. Furthermore, decreased antioxidant defense correlates with an increased cellular inflammatory response, whereas both concur with erythron and iron status, the latter explained by significant canonical correlations with the set of free radical scavenging enzymes and proinflammatory enzymes. The strong links between immune function, oxidative stress, and iron homeostasis suggest the presence of a self-sustaining multipathway mechanism that may progressively worsen, i.e., throughout accumulation of oxidative damage, producing the functional and structural consequences associated with depression.

In addition, we examined the molecular signaling pathways activated in the hippocampus of prenatally stressed rats, characterized by persistently elevated glucocorticoid levels in adulthood. In human hippocampal progenitor cells, we found that low concentrations of cortisol (100 nM) increased proliferation (+16%), decreased neurogenesis into microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive neurons (-24%) and doublecortin (Dcx)-positive neuroblasts (-21%), and increased differentiation into S100\u03b2-positive astrocytes (+23%). These effects were dependent on the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as they were abolished by the MR antagonist, spironolactone, and mimicked by the MR-agonist, aldosterone. In contrast, high concentrations of cortisol (100 \u03bcM) decreased proliferation (-17%) and neuronal differentiation into MAP2-positive neurons (-22%) and into Dcx-positive neuroblasts (-27%), without regulating astrogliogenesis. These effects were dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), blocked by the GR antagonist RU486, and mimicked by the GR-agonist, dexamethasone. Gene expression microarray and pathway analysis showed that the low concentration of cortisol enhances Notch/Hes-signaling, the high concentration inhibits TGF\u03b2-SMAD2/3-signaling, and both concentrations inhibit Hedgehog signaling.

On these bases, we investigated FKBP5 and GR expression and phosphorylation in the hippocampus (ventral and dorsal) and in the prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) and we analyzed the effect of a concomitant antidepressant treatment. We found that animals exposed to CMS show increased expression of FKBP5 as well as enhanced cytoplasmic levels of GR, primarily in ventral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Chronic treatment with the antidepressant duloxetine is able to normalize such alterations, mainly in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we demonstrate that CMS-induced alterations of GR trafficking and transcription may be sustained by changes in receptor phosphorylation, which are also modulated by pharmacological intervention.

Antidepressants reduced the levels of IL-1\u03b2 (-6%) and MIF (-24%), and increased the levels of GR (+5%) and p11 (+8%), but these changes were not associated with treatment response. In contrast, successful antidepressant response was associated with a reduction in the levels of IL-6 (-9%) and of FKBP5 (-11%), and with an increase in the levels of BDNF (+48%) and VGF (+20%)-that is, response was associated with changes in genes that did not predict, at the baseline, the response. Our findings indicate a dissociation between 'predictors' and 'targets' of antidepressant responders. Indeed, while higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines predict lack of future response to antidepressants, changes in inflammation associated with antidepressant response are not reflected by all cytokines at the same time. In contrast, modulation of the GR complex and of neuroplasticity is needed to observe a therapeutic antidepressant effect.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antidepressive Agents", "Depressive Disorder", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Interleukin-1beta", "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases", "Longitudinal Studies", "Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Transcriptome", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Annamaria", "Last Name": "Cattaneo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, Genetic and Biology Section, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Gennarelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rudolf", "Last Name": "Uher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerome", "Last Name": "Breen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Farmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine J", "Last Name": "Aitchison", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian W", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patricia A", "Last Name": "Zunsztain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "McGuffin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmine M", "Last Name": "Pariante", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
