MNS-4.1 is based on a structural motif that is very common in any random pool of oligonucleotides, and it is actually a nonspecific hydrophobic receptor with wide cross-reactivity with alkaloids and steroids. Despite such weaknesses preventing broad applications, this aptamer became widely used in proof-of-concept demonstrations of new formats of biosensors. We now report a series of progressively improved DNA aptamers recognizing cocaine, with the final optimized receptors having low nanomolar affinity and over a thousand-fold selectivity over the initial cross-reactants. In the process of optimization, we tested different methods to eliminate cross-reactivities and improve affinity, eventually achieving properties that are comparable to those of the reported monoclonal antibody candidates for the therapy of overdose. Multiple aptamers that we now report share structural motifs with the previously reported receptor for serotonin. Further mutagenesis studies revealed a palindromic, highly adaptable, broadly cross-reactive hydrophobic motif that could be rebuilt through mutagenesis, expansion of linker regions, and selections into receptors with exceptional affinities and varying specificities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyungae", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Obtin", "Last Name": "Alkhamis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Canoura", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Bryant", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mihaela", "Last Name": "Barbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dragan", "Last Name": "Nikic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Saswata", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Milan N", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "JACS Au", "PubDate": "2024Feb26"}, {"PMID": "38233588", "Title": "Carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors for resolving single-molecule aptamer-ligand binding kinetics.", "Abstract": "Small molecules such as neurotransmitters are critical for biochemical functions in living systems.

Here we demonstrate the potential of carbon-nanotube-based single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs), which can detect the charge on a single molecule, as a new platform for recognizing and assaying small molecules. smFETs are formed by the covalent attachment of a probe molecule, in our case a DNA aptamer, to a carbon nanotube. Conformation changes on binding are manifest as discrete changes in the nanotube electrical conductance. By monitoring the kinetics of conformational changes in a binding aptamer, we show that smFETs can detect and quantify serotonin at the single-molecule level, providing unique insights into the dynamics of the aptamer-ligand system. In particular, we show the involvement of G-quadruplex formation and the disruption of the native hairpin structure in the conformational changes of the serotonin-aptamer complex.

This is further compounded by the slow, cumbersome nature of the analytical methods used to monitor patient-specific pharmacokinetics, which inevitably rely on blood draws followed by post-facto laboratory analysis. Motivated by the pressing need for improved \"therapeutic drug monitoring\", we are developing electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors, a minimally invasive biosensor architecture that can provide real-time, seconds-resolved measurements of drug levels in situ in the living body. A key advantage of EAB sensors is that they are generalizable to the detection of a wide range of therapeutic agents because they are independent of the chemical or enzymatic reactivity of their targets. Three of the four therapeutic drug classes that have, to date, been shown measurable using in vivo EAB sensors, however, bind to nucleic acids as part of their mode of action, leaving open questions regarding the extent to which the approach can be generalized to therapeutics that do not.

By providing hundreds of drug concentration values, the resulting seconds-resolved measurements succeed in defining key pharmacokinetic parameters, including the drug's elimination rate, peak plasma concentration, and exposure (area under the curve), with unprecedented 5 to 10% precision. With this level of precision, we easily identify significant (>2-fold) differences in drug exposure occurring between even healthy rats given the same mass-adjusted methotrexate dose.

Because this signal transduction mechanism is single-step and rapidly reversible, EAB sensors support high-frequency, real-time molecular measurements, and because it recapitulates the reagentless, conformation-linked signaling seen in vivo among naturally occurring receptors, EAB sensors are selective enough to work in the complex, time-varying environments found in the living body. The fabrication of EAB sensors, however, requires that their target-recognizing aptamer be modified such that (1) it undergoes the necessary binding-induced conformational change and (2) that the thermodynamics of this \"conformational switch\" are tuned to ensure that they reflect an acceptable trade-off between affinity and signal gain. That is, even if an \"as-selected\" aptamer achieves useful affinity and specificity, it may fail when adapted to the EAB platform because it lacks the binding-induced conformational change required to support EAB signaling. In this paper we reveal the spectroscopy-guided approaches we use to modify aptamers such that they support the necessary binding-induced conformational change. Specifically, using newly reported aptamers, we demonstrate the systematic design of EAB sensors achieving clinically and physiologically relevant specificity, limits of detection, and dynamic range against the targets methotrexate and tryptophan.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aptamers, Nucleotide", "Biosensing Techniques", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Electrodes", "Spectrum Analysis", "Electrochemical Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuyang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}, {"First Name": "Simona", "Last Name": "Ranallo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Del Grosso", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chamoro-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}, {"First Name": "Herbert L", "Last Name": "Ennis", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nenad", "Last Name": "Milosavi\u0107", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kyungae", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tod", "Last Name": "Kippin", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Ricci", "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, 00133 Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Milan", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin W", "Last Name": "Plaxco", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106, United States."}], "Journal": "Bioconjugate chemistry", "PubDate": "2023Jan18"}, {"PMID": "36006852", "Title": "Oligonucleotide-Blocked Streptavidin for Biotinylation Analysis.", "Abstract": "Binding between streptavidin, or its homologues, to biotin is one of the most widely exploited biological interactions in the biomedical sciences.

To overcome this and other limitations, we developed a flexible field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor array that exploits a previously unreported cortisol aptamer coupled to nanometer-thin-film In2O3 FETs. Cortisol levels were determined via molecular recognition by aptamers where binding was transduced to electrical signals on FETs. The physiological relevance of cortisol as a stress biomarker was demonstrated by tracking salivary cortisol levels in participants in a Trier Social Stress Test and establishing correlations between cortisol in diurnal saliva and sweat samples.

Recent approaches for treating phenylketonuria focus on injectable medications that efficiently break down phenylalanine but sometimes result in detrimentally low phenylalanine levels. We have identified new DNA aptamers for phenylalanine in two formats, initially as fluorescent sensors and then, incorporated with field-effect transistors (FETs). Aptamer-FET sensors detected phenylalanine over a wide range of concentrations (fM to mM). para-Chlorophenylalanine, which inhibits the enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, was used to induce hyperphenylalaninemia during brain development in mice. Aptamer-FET sensors were specific for phenylalanine versus para-chlorophenylalanine and differentiated changes in mouse serum phenylalanine at levels expected in patients. Aptamer-FETs can be used to investigate models of hyperphenylalanemia in the presence of structurally related enzyme inhibitors, as well as naturally occurring amino acids. Nucleic acid-based receptors that discriminate phenylalanine analogs, some that differ by a single substituent, indicate a refined ability to identify aptamers with binding pockets tailored for high affinity and specificity.

Free solution electrokinetics allows coupling of affinity selection and amplification for closed loop oligonucleotide enrichment without the need for offline processes, flow handling components or gel components, while bead based selection and amplification allow efficient manipulation of reagents and reaction products thereby realizing on-chip loop closure and integration of the entire SELEX process.

The third new class accommodates hydroxyl groups in high-affinity, high-selectivity binding pockets, thus reversing the preferences of the first two classes.

The chip makes use of bead-immobilized target molecules and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequences to enable a simplified chip design, in which affinity selection and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of target-binding sequences occur in temperature-controlled microchambers. Using pressure-driven flow, buffer containing single-stranded DNA molecules with randomized sequences is cycled through a series of affinity selection and PCR amplification steps on microbeads. Successive introduction of the sample to each chamber effects a process of competition whereby DNA strands with weak binding strength to target molecules are rejected in favor of strongly binding sequences. Using bead-based PCR, the amplification step was miniaturized and integrated with affinity selection, resulting in significant reductions in process time and reagent use. As a demonstration, temperature-dependent selection and amplification of single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind to human Immuno-globulin E (IgE) was performed in 4 h, a 20-fold reduction in process time as compared to conventional methods that would require approximately a week. Fluorescent binding assays then demonstrated that the desired temperature specificity was imparted to the aptamer candidates within just one round of selection, and within two rounds the aptamer candidates exhibited enhanced affinity toward IgE.", "Keywords": ["Aptamers", "Microfluidics", "Proteins", "SELEX", "Temperature dependence"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Hilton", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "ThaiHuu", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mihaela", "Last Name": "Barbu", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Renjun", "Last Name": "Pei", "Affiliation": "Suzhou Institute of Nano\u2011Tech and Nano\u2011Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Milan", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiao", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Microfluidics and nanofluidics", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26350723", "Title": "Discovery of New Classes of Compounds that Reactivate Acetylcholinesterase Inhibited by Organophosphates.", "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that has been covalently inhibited by organophosphate compounds (OPCs), such as nerve agents and pesticides, has traditionally been reactivated by using nucleophilic oximes.

Affinity-based methods, such as those that recognise cells by binding antibodies to cell membrane biomarkers, can be used to achieve specific cell isolation. Microfluidic techniques have been employed to achieve more efficient and effective cell isolation. By employing aptamers as surface-immobilised ligands, cells can be easily released and collected after specific capture. However, these methods still have limitations in cell release efficiency and spatial selectivity. This study presents an aptamer-based microfluidic device that not only achieves specific affinity cell capture, but also enables spatially selective temperature-mediated release and retrieval of cells without detectable damage. The specific cell capture is realised by using surface-patterned aptamers in a microchamber on a temperature-control chip. Spatially selective cell release is achieved by utilising a group of microheater and temperature sensor that restricts temperature changes, and therefore the disruption of cell-aptamer interactions, to a design-specified region. Experimental results with CCRF-CEM cells and sgc8c aptamers have demonstrated the specific cell capture and temperature-mediated release of selected groups of cells with negligible disruption to their viability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aptamers, Nucleotide", "Cell Line", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Flow Cytometry", "Flow Injection Analysis", "Heating", "Humans", "Microfluidic Analytical Techniques", "T-Lymphocytes", "Thermography", "Tissue Array Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Junyi", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Renjun", "Last Name": "Pei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Milan", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qiao", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IET nanobiotechnology", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24873234", "Title": "Exercises in molecular computing.", "Abstract": "CONSPECTUS: The successes of electronic digital logic have transformed every aspect of human life over the last half-century. The word \"computer\" now signifies a ubiquitous electronic device, rather than a human occupation. Yet evidently humans, large assemblies of molecules, can compute, and it has been a thrilling challenge to develop smaller, simpler, synthetic assemblies of molecules that can do useful computation. When we say that molecules compute, what we usually mean is that such molecules respond to certain inputs, for example, the presence or absence of other molecules, in a precisely defined but potentially complex fashion. The simplest way for a chemist to think about computing molecules is as sensors that can integrate the presence or absence of multiple analytes into a change in a single reporting property. Here we review several forms of molecular computing developed in our laboratories. When we began our work, combinatorial approaches to using DNA for computing were used to search for solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. We chose to work instead on logic circuits, building bottom-up from units based on catalytic nucleic acids, focusing on DNA secondary structures in the design of individual circuit elements, and reserving the combinatorial opportunities of DNA for the representation of multiple signals propagating in a large circuit. Such circuit design directly corresponds to the intuition about sensors transforming the detection of analytes into reporting properties. While this approach was unusual at the time, it has been adopted since by other groups working on biomolecular computing with different nucleic acid chemistries. We created logic gates by modularly combining deoxyribozymes (DNA-based enzymes cleaving or combining other oligonucleotides), in the role of reporting elements, with stem-loops as input detection elements. For instance, a deoxyribozyme that normally exhibits an oligonucleotide substrate recognition region is modified such that a stem-loop closes onto the substrate recognition region, making it unavailable for the substrate and thus rendering the deoxyribozyme inactive. But a conformational change can then be induced by an input oligonucleotide, complementary to the loop, to open the stem, allow the substrate to bind, and allow its cleavage to proceed, which is eventually reported via fluorescence. In this Account, several designs of this form are reviewed, along with their application in the construction of large circuits that exhibited complex logical and temporal relationships between the inputs and the outputs. Intelligent (in the sense of being capable of nontrivial information processing) theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) applications have always been the ultimate motivation for developing computing (i.e., decision-making) circuits, and we review our experiments with logic-gate elements bound to cell surfaces that evaluate the proximal presence of multiple markers on lymphocytes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antigens, CD20", "Biomarkers", "Computers, Molecular", "DNA", "DNA, Catalytic", "Humans", "Leukocyte Common Antigens", "Lymphocytes", "Oligonucleotides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Milan N", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, and Systems Biology, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Darko", "Last Name": "Stefanovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergei", "Last Name": "Rudchenko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "PubDate": "2014Jun17"}, {"PMID": "24729660", "Title": "Nucleic Acid Isolation and Enrichment on a Microchip.", "Abstract": "This paper presents a microchip that isolates and enriches target-binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from a randomized DNA mixture using a combination of solid-phase extraction and electrophoresis.

The strands are further separated from impurities and enriched on-chip via electrophoresis. The microchip consists of two microchambers that are connected by a channel filled with agarose gel. In the isolation chamber, beads functionalized with human immunoglobulin E (IgE) are retained by a weir structure.
