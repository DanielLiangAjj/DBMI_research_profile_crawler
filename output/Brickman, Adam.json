[{"PMID": "38883742", "Title": "A Neuropathology Case Report of a Woman with Down Syndrome who Remained Cognitively Stable.", "Abstract": "In this neuropathology case report, we present findings from an individual with Down syndrome (DS) who remained cognitively stable despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Clinical assessments, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, and neuropathological examinations were conducted to characterize her condition. Notably, her ApoE genotype was E2/3, which is associated with a decreased risk of dementia. Neuroimaging revealed stable yet elevated amyloid profiles and moderately elevated tau levels, while neuropathology indicated intermediate AD neuropathologic change with Lewy body pathology and cerebrovascular pathology. Despite the presence of AD pathology, the participant demonstrated intact cognitive functioning, potentially attributed to factors such as genetic variations, cognitive resilience, and environmental enrichment. The findings suggest a dissociation between clinical symptoms and neuropathological changes, emphasizing the complexity of AD progression in DS. Further investigation into factors influencing cognitive resilience in individuals with DS, including comorbidities and social functioning, is warranted. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive stability in DS could offer insights into resilience to AD neuropathology in people with DS and in the general population and inform future interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jr-Jiun", "Last Name": "Liou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jerry", "Last Name": "Lou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jamie", "Last Name": "Nakagiri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Yong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christy L", "Last Name": "Hom", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric W", "Last Name": "Doran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Minodora", "Last Name": "Totoiu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Lott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Mapstone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Keator", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sierra", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brittany", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Florence", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Xicota", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lam-Ha T", "Last Name": "Dang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jinghang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tales", "Last Name": "Santini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Mettenburg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Milos D", "Last Name": "Ikonomovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Kofler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tamer", "Last Name": "Ibrahim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Head", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jun03"}, {"PMID": "38826390", "Title": "Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STAR U): Short-term outcomes of a training program to advance diversity in aging research.", "Abstract": "The Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STAR U) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, aims to advance diversity in aging research through undergraduate education.

In the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study (ABC-DS; n\u2009=\u2009242; age\u2009=\u200925-72), we estimated the age inflection point at which MRI-based white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), microbleeds, and infarcts emerge in relation to demographic data, risk factors, amyloid and tau, and AD diagnosis. Enlarged PVS and infarcts appear to develop in the early 30s, while microbleeds, WMH, amyloid, and tau emerge in the mid to late 30s. Age-residualized WMH were higher in women, in individuals with dementia, and with lower body mass index.

Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration.

Biomarkers based on routinely acquired clinical MR images, could supplement the extant invasive or logistically challenging) biomarker studies. We used 1104 longitudinal MR, 324 amyloid beta, and 87 tau positron emission tomography imaging sessions from 525 participants enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational Study to extract novel imaging metrics representing the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of standardized image intensities of T1-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR scans. There was an exponential decrease in FLAIR-\u03bc in mutation carriers and an increase in FLAIR and T1 signal heterogeneity (T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3) as participants approached the symptom onset in both supramarginal, the right postcentral and right superior temporal gyri as well as both caudate nuclei, putamina, thalami, and amygdalae. After controlling for the effect of regional atrophy, FLAIR-\u03bc decreased and T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3 increased with increasing amyloid beta and tau deposition in numerous cortical regions. In symptomatic mutation carriers and independent of the effect of regional atrophy, tau pathology demonstrated a stronger relationship with image intensity metrics, compared with amyloid pathology. We propose novel MR imaging intensity-based metrics using standard clinical T1 and FLAIR images which strongly associates with the progression of pathology in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease. We suggest that tau pathology may be a key driver of the observed changes in this cohort of patients.", "Keywords": ["T1 and FLAIR signal intensity", "amyloid PET", "dominantly inherited Alzheimer

Offspring from ADAD families have a 50% chance of inheriting their familial mutation, so non-carrier siblings can be recruited for comparisons in case-control studies. The age of onset in ADAD is highly predictable within families, allowing researchers to estimate an individual's point in the disease trajectory. These characteristics allow candidate AD biomarker measurements to be reliably mapped during the preclinical phase. Although ADAD represents a small proportion of AD cases, understanding neuroimaging-based changes that occur during the preclinical period may provide insight into early disease stages of 'sporadic' AD also.

Previous studies suggested that consumption of dietary flavanols might specifically be associated with the hippocampal-dependent memory component of cognitive aging and that memory benefits of a flavanol intervention might depend on habitual diet quality. Here, we tested these hypotheses in the context of a large-scale study of 3,562 older adults, who were randomly assigned to a 3-y intervention of cocoa extract (500 mg of cocoa flavanols per day) or a placebo [(COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study) COSMOS-Web, NCT04582617]. Using the alternative Healthy Eating Index in all participants and a urine-based biomarker of flavanol intake in a subset of participants [n = 1,361], we show that habitual flavanol consumption and diet quality at baseline are positively and selectively correlated with hippocampal-dependent memory. While the prespecified primary end point testing for an intervention-related improvement in memory in all participants after 1 y was not statistically significant, the flavanol intervention restored memory among participants in lower tertiles of habitual diet quality or habitual flavanol consumption. Increases in the flavanol biomarker over the course of the trial were associated with improving memory. Collectively, our results allow dietary flavanols to be considered in the context of a depletion-repletion paradigm and suggest that low flavanol consumption can act as a driver of the hippocampal-dependent component of cognitive aging.", "Keywords": ["cognitive aging", "dietary flavanols", "hippocampus"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "Diet", "Dietary Supplements", "Polyphenols", "Biomarkers", "Cacao", "Double-Blind Method"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Lok-Kin", "Last Name": "Yeung", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Alschuler", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Data Science Area, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Javier I", "Last Name": "Ottaviani", "Affiliation": "Mars Inc., 6885 Elm St, McLean, VA 22101."}, {"First Name": "Gunter G C", "Last Name": "Kuhnle", "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6DZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Data Science Area, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Heike", "Last Name": "Luttmann-Gibson", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."}, {"First Name": "Trisha", "Last Name": "Copeland", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."}, {"First Name": "Hagen", "Last Name": "Schroeter", "Affiliation": "Mars Inc., 6885 Elm St, McLean, VA 22101."}, {"First Name": "Howard D", "Last Name": "Sesso", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."}, {"First Name": "JoAnn E", "Last Name": "Manson", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Data Science Area, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jun06"}, {"PMID": "37244291", "Title": "Multivitamin Supplementation Improves Memory in Older Adults: A\u00a0Randomized Clinical Trial.", "Abstract": "Maintenance of cognitive abilities is of critical importance to older adults, yet few effective strategies to slow cognitive decline currently exist.

In Alzheimer's disease dementia, both semantic and episodic memory become impaired early in the disease process. Given the need to develop sensitive and accessible cognitive markers for early detection of dementia, we investigated among older adults without dementia whether item-level metrics of semantic fluency related to episodic memory decline above and beyond existing neuropsychological measures and total fluency score. Participants were drawn from the community-based Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project cohort (N = 583 English speakers, Mage = 76.3 \u00b1 6.8) followed up to five visits across up to 11 years. We examined the association of semantic fluency metrics with subsequent declines in memory performance using latent growth curve models covaried for age and recruitment wave. Results showed that item-level metrics (e.g., lexical frequency, age of acquisition, and semantic neighborhood density) were associated with a decline in episodic memory-even when covarying for other cognitive tests-while the standard total score was not. Moderation analyses showed that the relationship of semantic fluency metrics with memory decline did not differ across race, sex/gender, or education. In conclusion, item-level data hold a wealth of information with potential to reveal subtle semantic memory impairment, which tracks with episodic memory impairment, among older adults without dementia beyond existing neuropsychological measures. Implementation of psycholinguistic metrics may point to cognitive tools that have better prognostic value or are more sensitive to cognitive change in the context of clinical trials or observational studies.

Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD)\u00a0=\u00a076.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Cerebrovascular disease", "Hippocampus", "Long-term memory", "Small vessel disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Aged", "White Matter", "Temporal Lobe", "Alzheimer Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Long-Term", "Atrophy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mithra", "Last Name": "Sathishkumar", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Freddie", "Last Name": "M\u00e1rquez", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Granger", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myra S", "Last Name": "Larson", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Blake A", "Last Name": "Miranda", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina K", "Last Name": "Hollearn", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liv", "Last Name": "McMillan", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Statistics, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Tustison", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Radiology and Medical Imaging, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

We hypothesize that in a similar manner there should be nutrients vital to the aging brain and that based on aging's distinct pathophysiology they should be different than those essential to development. Specific brain networks that govern cognition are particularly vulnerable to the aging process, resulting in what is referred to as 'cognitive aging'. Common late-life disorders, however, such as Alzheimer's disease also target these same brain networks. Studies have disambiguated cognitive aging from late-life disease by isolating regions and biological pathways within each network differentially linked to one or the other. This anatomical biology anchors a framework to identify nutrients and/or dietary bioactives relevant to cognitive aging whose utility is illustrated via a decades-long research program into how dietary bioactive flavanols benefit the brain. As we are living longer in cognitively more demanding lives, the framework's ultimate goal is to generate specific dietary recommendations that will fortify our mind for its golden years.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Nutrients", "Biology", "Cognition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vincenzo", "Last Name": "Lauriola", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1050 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1050 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA.

We previously reported that ATP-binding cassette family A protein 1 (ABCA1) deficiency in humans and mice decreases plasma SM levels. However, overexpression, induction, downregulation, inhibition, and knockdown of ABCA1 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells did not decrease SM efflux. Using unbiased siRNA screening, here, we identified that ABCA7 plays a role in the biosynthesis and efflux of SM without affecting cellular uptake and metabolism. Since loss of function mutations in the ABCA7 gene exhibit strong associations with late-onset Alzheimer's disease across racial groups, we also studied the effects of ABCA7 deficiency in the mouse brain. Brains of ABCA7-deficient (KO) mice, compared with WT, had significantly lower levels of several SM species with long chain fatty acids. In addition, we observed that older KO mice exhibited behavioral deficits in cognitive discrimination in the active place avoidance task. Next, we performed synaptic transmission studies in brain slices obtained from older mice. We found anomalies in synaptic plasticity at the intracortical synapse in layer II/III of the lateral entorhinal cortex but not in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in KO mice. These synaptic abnormalities in KO brain slices were rescued with extracellular SM supplementation but not by supplementation with phosphatidylcholine. Taken together, these studies identify a role of ABCA7 in brain SM metabolism and the importance of SM in synaptic plasticity and cognition, as well as provide a possible explanation for the association between ABCA7 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": ["ABCA7", "Alzheimer Disease", "lipids", "sphingolipids", "sphingomyelin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Alzheimer Disease", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Cognition", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Sphingomyelins", "Mice, Knockout"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jahangir", "Last Name": "Iqbal", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA; King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Manuel D", "Last Name": "Suarez", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Physiology/Pharmacology, The Robert F.

There is sexual dimorphism in immunological functioning, and neuroimmune processes are implicated in Alzheimer's disease genesis. Using neuropathology indicators from human brain tissue, we examined the mediational role of microglial activation on the relationship between amyloid and tau and how it differs by sex. 187 decedents (64% female; 89 mean age at death; 62% non-demented) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project completed neuropathological evaluations with brain tissue quantified for microglial activation, amyloid-\u03b2 and tau. Proportion of morphologically activated microglia was determined via immunohistochemistry (HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphological staging (stage I, II or III). Amyloid-\u03b2 and tau burden were quantified via immunohistochemistry (M00872 or AT8, respectively). Using causal counterfactual modelling, we estimated the mediational effect of microglial activation on the amyloid-\u03b2 to tau relationship in the whole sample and stratified by sex (amyloid-\u03b2 \u2192 microglial activation \u2192 tau). Alternative models tested the role of microglia activation as the precipitating event (microglial activation \u2192 amyloid-\u03b2 \u2192 tau). Microglial activation significantly mediated 33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-67] of the relationship between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau in the whole sample; stratified analyses suggested this effect was stronger and only statistically significant in females. 57% (95% CI 22-100) of the effect of amyloid-\u03b2 on tau was mediated through microglial activation in females, compared to 19% (95% CI 0-64) in males. Regional analyses suggested that mediational effects were driven by greater cortical versus subcortical microglial activation. Relationships were independent of cerebrovascular disease indices. Alternative models suggested that in females, microglial activation was a significant exposure both preceding the amyloid-\u03b2 to tau relationship (mediational effect: 50%, 95% CI 23-90) and directly related to tau burden (microglia direct effect: 50%, 95% CI 10-77). By contrast, in males, only the direct effect of microglial activation to tau reached significance (74%, 95% CI 32-100) (mediational effect: 26%, 95% CI 0-68). Our models suggest a reciprocal, bidirectional relationship between amyloid-\u03b2 and microglial activation that significantly accounts for tau burden in females. By contrast, in males, direct independent (non-mediational) relationships between microglial activation or amyloid-\u03b2 with tau were observed. Microglial activation may be disproportionately important for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in females.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a form of cerebrovascular pathology that results from the build-up of \u03b2-amyloid in the vessel walls. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy commonly co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease pathology in the ageing brain and increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease dementia. In the present study, we examined whether cerebral amyloid angiopathy influences tau deposition and cognitive decline independently or synergistically with parenchymal \u03b2-amyloid burden. Secondly, we examined whether tau burden mediates the association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive decline. We included data from autopsied subjects recruited from one of three longitudinal clinical-pathological cohort studies: the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Religious Orders Study and the Minority Aging Research Study. Participants completed annual clinical and cognitive evaluations and underwent brain autopsy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology was rated as none, mild, moderate or severe. Bielschowsky silver stain was used to visualize neuritic \u03b2-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We used linear regression and linear mixed models to test independent versus interactive associations of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and neuritic plaque burden with tau burden and longitudinal cognitive decline, respectively. We used causal mediation models to examine whether tau mediates the association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive decline. The study sample included 1722 autopsied subjects (age at baseline\u2009=\u200980.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1 years; age at death\u2009=\u200989.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 years; 68% females). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy interacted with neuritic plaques to accelerate tau burden and cognitive decline. Specifically, those with more severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology and higher levels of neuritic plaque burden had greater tau burden and faster cognitive decline. We also found that tau mediated the association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive decline among participants with higher neuritic plaque burden. In summary, more severe levels of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and higher parenchymal \u03b2-amyloid burden interacted to promote cognitive decline indirectly via tau deposition. These results highlight the dynamic interplay between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease pathology in accelerating progression toward dementia.

Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) we can assess the in-vivo regional amyloid load using several available ligands. To measure amyloid distributions in specific brain regions, a brain atlas is used. A popular method of creating a brain atlas is to segment a participant's structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Acquiring an MRI is often challenging in intellectually-imparied populations because of contraindications or data exclusion due to significant motion artifacts or incomplete sequences related to general discomfort. When an MRI cannot be acquired, it is typically replaced with a standardized brain atlas derived from neurotypical populations (i.e. healthy individuals without DS) which may be inappropriate for use in DS. In this project, we create a series of disease and diagnosis-specific (cognitively stable (CS-DS), mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DS), and dementia (DEM-DS)) probabilistic group atlases of participants with DS and evaluate their accuracy of quantifying regional amyloid load compared to the individually-based MRI segmentations. Further, we compare the diagnostic-specific atlases with a probabilistic atlas constructed from similar-aged cognitively-stable neurotypical participants. We hypothesized that regional PET signals will best match the individually-based MRI segmentations by using DS group atlases that aligns with a participant's disorder and disease status (e.g. DS and MCI-DS).

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

financial decision making abilities (or financial awareness) are both critical to study in older adults as they can help identify those at risk for making suboptimal financial decisions and prevent financial loss. In the current study, we examined the cognitive and cortical thickness correlates of financial decision making and financial awareness in 59 community-dwelling participants co-enrolled in a larger study (mean age=68.35 years (SD=5.5), mean education=15.91 (SD=2.36), 61% = women, 67% = White, 30% = Black participants). Data from standardized measures of financial decision making and cognition was investigated along with FreeSurfer (v. 5.3) derived thickness regions. Based on metacognitive frameworks, financial awareness was measured along with a well-validated measure of memory awareness. Results revealed that numeracy, executive functioning and vocabulary were associated with financial decision making, whereas in analysis adjusted for financial decision making, memory awareness relative to cognition was most strongly linked to financial awareness. No significant associations between thickness and financial decision making were found. However, both financial and memory awareness were associated with the same right-hemisphere temporal thickness regions underscoring the idea of a common substrate of awareness. Interestingly, our findings converge with the emerging work on financial exploitation in which the right sided temporal regions have been found to play a prominent role. Incorporating the contributing role of self-awareness in various models of financial exploitation will be an important consideration for future studies.", "Keywords": ["cognition", "cortical thickness", "financial decision making", "medial temporal region", "self-awareness"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Preeti", "Last Name": "Sunderaraman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. psun@bu.edu."}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanna", "Last Name": "Varangis", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jillian L", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whitney", "Last Name": "Hartstone", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain imaging and behavior", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "34709529", "Title": "Cognitive Functioning and Health in Hispanic/Latina Breast Cancer Survivors.", "Abstract": "We examined the effect of waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index (BMI), diet, and physical activity on cognitive functioning among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors in a cross-sectional design study.

They are typically attributed to small vessel cerebrovascular disease in the context of aging. Among older adults, WMH are associated with risk of cognitive decline and dementia, stroke, and various other health outcomes. There has been increasing interest in incorporating quantitative WMH measurement as outcomes in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical settings. Here, we present a novel, fully automated, unsupervised detection algorithm for WMH segmentation and quantification. The algorithm uses a robust preprocessing pipeline, including brain extraction and a sample-specific mask that incorporates spatial information for automatic false positive reduction, and a half Gaussian mixture model (HGMM). The method was evaluated in 24 participants with varying degrees of WMH (4.9-78.6\u00a0cm3) from a community-based study of aging and dementia with dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, correlation, and bias relative to the ground truth manual segmentation approach performed by two expert raters. Results were compared with those derived from commonly used available WMH segmentation packages, including SPM lesion probability algorithm (LPA), SPM lesion growing algorithm (LGA), and Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA). The HGMM algorithm derived WMH values that had a dice score of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.99 compared to ground truth. White matter hyperintensity volumes derived with HGMM were strongly correlated with ground truth values (r\u00a0=\u00a00.97, p\u00a0=\u00a03.9e-16), with no observable bias (-1.1 [-2.6, 0.44], p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.16).

Progressive damage to the cerebral microvasculature may also trigger angiogenic processes to promote vessel repair. Elevated levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and pro-angiogenic signaling proteins are observed in response to vascular injury. We aimed to examine circulating levels of EPCs and proangiogenic proteins in older adults with evidence of SVD. Methods: Older adults (ages 55-90) free of dementia or stroke underwent venipuncture and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Flow cytometry quantified circulating EPCs as the number of cells in the lymphocyte gate positively expressing EPC surface markers (CD34+CD133+CD309+). Plasma was assayed for proangiogenic factors (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, Tie-2, and Flt-1). Total SVD burden score was determined based on MRI markers, including white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds and lacunes. Results: Sixty-four older adults were included. Linear regression revealed that older adults with higher circulating EPC levels exhibited greater total SVD burden [\u03b2 = 1.0 \u00d7 105, 95% CI (0.2, 1.9), p = 0.019], after accounting for age and sex. Similarly, a positive relationship between circulating VEGF-D and total SVD score was observed, controlling for age and sex [\u03b2 = 0.001, 95% CI (0.000, 0.001), p = 0.048]. Conclusion: These findings suggest that elevated levels of circulating EPCs and VEGF-D correspond with greater cerebral SVD burden in older adults.

Methods: Twenty healthy, community-dwelling individuals aged 50-71 (11 women) took part in the study. Episodic memory was evaluated using a Directed Forgetting task, and GABA+ was measured in the right hippocampus using a Mescher-Garwood point-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence. Multiple linear regression models were used to quantify the relationship between episodic memory, GABA+, ApoE \u025b4, and sex, controlling for age and education. Results: While GABA+ did not interact with ApoE \u025b4 carrier status to influence episodic memory (p = 0.757), the relationship between GABA+ and episodic memory was moderated by sex: lower GABA+ predicted worse memory in women such that, for each standard deviation decrease in GABA+ concentration, memory scores were reduced by 11% (p = 0.001). Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that sex, but not ApoE \u025b4 genotype, moderates the relationship between hippocampal GABA+ and episodic memory, such that women with lower GABA+ concentration show worse memory performance. These findings, which must be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, may serve as a starting point for larger studies using multimodal neuroimaging to understand the contributions of GABA metabolism to age-related memory decline.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "GABA", "apolipoprotein \u03b54", "episodic memory", "sex", "\u03b3-aminobutyric acid"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Balado", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Ycaza Herrera", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kay", "Last Name": "Igwe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lynda", "Last Name": "Klem", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Korhan", "Last Name": "Buyukturkoglu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrei", "Last Name": "Irimia", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Liu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Teal S", "Last Name": "Eich", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34397745", "Title": "Cerebrovascular Contributions to Neurocognitive Disorders in People Living With HIV.", "Abstract": "To investigate a comprehensive array of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) and relate these imaging biomarkers to cognition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Brain", "Brain Infarction", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Constriction, Pathologic", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Intracranial Arterial Diseases", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany N", "Last Name": "Porras", "Affiliation": "Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY."}, {"First Name": "Moka", "Last Name": "Yoo-Jeong", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Farid", "Last Name": "Khasiyev", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, MI."}, {"First Name": "Kay C", "Last Name": "Igwe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Krystal K", "Last Name": "Laing", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marykay", "Last Name": "Pavol", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Schnall", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY; and."}], "Journal": "Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)", "PubDate": "2021Sep01"}, {"PMID": "34365016", "Title": "\u00a1Mi Vida Saludable!

Psychosocial factors, such as discrimination and perceived control, also differ across racial/ethnic groups, and emerging literature highlights their potential role in contributing to cognitive disparities in addition to socioeconomic status. Method: 1,463 older adults (51% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic Black, and 22% non-Hispanic White) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project completed cognitive and psychosocial measures, including a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Everyday and Major Experiences of Lifetime Discrimination scales, and the Perceived Control scale. Mediation models quantified separate indirect effects of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity on global cognitive composite scores through education, income, discrimination, and external perceived control. Results: Educational attainment, income, and perceived control each mediated racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition. Socioeconomic indicators (i.e., lower education and lower income) explained approximately 50% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in global cognition, and more external perceived control explained an additional 5%-8%. Hispanics reported the lowest levels of discrimination, while non-Hispanic Blacks reported the highest levels. However, neither everyday nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with global cognition. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition remained after accounting for the included socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Conclusions: This study suggests that psychosocial factors may explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging above and beyond socioeconomic indicators. More external perceived control, which could reflect chronic exposure to interpersonal and institutional marginalization, may be a particularly salient psychosocial risk factor for poorer cognitive aging among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults.

The current gold standard for detecting and rating cerebral microbleeds in a research context is visual inspection by trained raters, a process that is both time consuming and subject to poor reliability. We present here a novel method to automate microbleed detection on GRE and SWI images. We demonstrate in a community-based cohort of older adults that the method is highly sensitive (greater than 92% of all microbleeds accurately detected) across both modalities, with reasonable precision (fewer than 20 and 10 false positives per scan on GRE and SWI, respectively). We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to identify microbleeds over longitudinal scans with a higher level of sensitivity than visual ratings (50% of longitudinal microbleeds correctly labeled by the algorithm, while manual ratings was 30% or lower). Further, the algorithm identifies the anatomical localization of microbleeds based on brain atlases, and greatly reduces time spent completing visual ratings (43% reduction in visual rating time). Our automatic microbleed detection instrument is ideal for implementation in large-scale studies that include cross-sectional and longitudinal scanning, as well as being capable of performing well across multiple commonly used MRI modalities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Cerebellum", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia, Vascular", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Microvessels", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony G", "Last Name": "Chesebro", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Amarante", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irene B", "Last Name": "Meier", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. amb2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Feb17"}, {"PMID": "33589674", "Title": "Insights into the role of diet and dietary flavanols in cognitive aging: results of a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "With the world's population aging, age-related memory decline is an impending cognitive epidemic. Assessing the impact of diet on cognitive aging, we conducted a controlled, randomized, parallel-arm dietary intervention with 211 healthy adults (50-75\u00a0years) investigating effects of either a placebo or 260, 510 and 770\u00a0mg/day of cocoa flavanols for 12-weeks followed by 8-weeks washout. The primary outcome was a newly-developed object-recognition task localized to the hippocampus' dentate gyrus. Secondary outcomes included a hippocampal-dependent list-learning task and a prefrontal cortex-dependent list-sorting task. The alternative Healthy Eating Index and a biomarker of flavanol intake (gVLM) were measured. In an MRI substudy, hippocampal cerebral blood volume was mapped. Object-recognition and list-sorting performance did not correlate with baseline diet quality and did not improve after flavanol intake. However, the hippocampal-dependent list-learning performance was directly associated with baseline diet quality and improved after flavanol intake, particularly in participants in the bottom tertile of baseline diet quality. In the imaging substudy, a region-of-interest analysis was negative but a voxel-based-analysis suggested that dietary flavanols target the dentate gyrus. While replication is needed, these findings suggest that diet in general, and dietary flavanols in particular, may be associated with memory function of the aging hippocampus and normal cognitive decline.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Cognition", "Cognitive Aging", "Diet", "Dietary Supplements", "Female", "Flavonols", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nutritional Status", "Physical Functional Performance", "Public Health Surveillance", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA. rps7@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1050 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lok-Kin", "Last Name": "Yeung", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tianshu", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1050 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinyang", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Provenzano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hagen", "Last Name": "Schroeter", "Affiliation": "Mars Inc., 6885 Elm St, McLean, VA, 22101, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo", "Last Name": "Lauriola", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 West 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA. sas68@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Feb15"}, {"PMID": "33580742", "Title": "Plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, and other blood-based Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in a multi-ethnic, community study.", "Abstract": "Blood-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers provide opportunities for community studies and across ethnic groups.

Introduction: Cross-sectional measures were assessed in MC (n\u2009=\u2009171) and mutation noncarrier (NC) (n\u2009=\u200970) participants. A functional connectivity (FC) matrix that encompassed multiple resting-state networks was computed for each participant. Methods: A global FC was compiled as a single index indicating FC strength. The gFC signature was modeled as a nonlinear function of EYO. The gFC was linearly associated with other biomarkers used for assessing the AT(N) framework, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positron emission tomography (PET) molecular biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The gFC was reduced in MC compared with NC participants. When MC participants were differentiated by clinical dementia rating (CDR), the gFC was significantly decreased in MC CDR >0 (demented) compared with either MC CDR 0 (cognitively normal) or NC participants. The gFC varied nonlinearly with EYO and initially decreased at EYO\u2009=\u2009-24 years, followed by a stable period followed by a further decline near EYO\u2009=\u20090 years. Irrespective of EYO, a lower gFC associated with values of amyloid PET, CSF A\u03b21-42, CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and hippocampal volume.

of interest preferentially affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology may offer improved sensitivity to early AD compared to hippocampal volume or mesial temporal lobe alone. Since late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) participants tend to have age-related comorbidities, the younger-onset age in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) may provide a more idealized model of cortical thinning in AD. To test this, the goals of this study were to compare the degree of overlap between the ADAD and LOAD cortical thinning maps and to evaluate the ability of the ADAD cortical signature regions to predict early pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals. We defined and analyzed the LOAD cortical maps of cortical thickness in 588 participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) and the ADAD cortical maps in 269 participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study. Both cohorts were divided into three groups: cognitively normal controls (nADRC\u00a0=\u00a0381; nDIAN\u00a0=\u00a0145), preclinical (nADRC\u00a0=\u00a0153; nDIAN\u00a0=\u00a076), and cognitively impaired (nADRC\u00a0=\u00a054; nDIAN\u00a0=\u00a048). Both cohorts underwent clinical assessments, 3T MRI, and amyloid PET imaging with either 11C-Pittsburgh compound B or 18F-florbetapir. To generate cortical signature maps of cortical thickness, we performed a vertex-wise analysis between the cognitively normal controls and impaired groups within each cohort using six increasingly conservative statistical thresholds to determine significance. The optimal cortical map among the six statistical thresholds was determined from a receiver operating characteristic analysis testing the performance of each map in discriminating between the cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups. We then performed within-cohort and cross-cohort (e.g. ADAD maps evaluated in the Knight ADRC cohort) analyses to examine the sensitivity of the optimal cortical signature maps to the amyloid levels using only the cognitively normal individuals (cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups) in comparison to hippocampal volume. We found the optimal cortical signature maps were sensitive to early increases in amyloid for the asymptomatic individuals within their respective cohorts and were significant beyond the inclusion of hippocampus volume, but the cortical signature maps performed poorly when analyzing across cohorts. These results suggest the cortical signature maps are a useful MRI biomarker of early AD-related neurodegeneration in preclinical individuals and the pattern of decline differs between LOAD and ADAD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Amyloid", "Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease", "Cortical signature", "Cortical thickness", "Preclinical"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Atrophy", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aylin", "Last Name": "Dincer", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian A", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amrita", "Last Name": "Hari-Raj", "Affiliation": "The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah J", "Last Name": "Keefe", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shaney", "Last Name": "Flores", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole S", "Last Name": "McKay", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Paulick", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristine E", "Last Name": "Shady Lewis", "Affiliation": "Sanders Brown Center on Aging & Alzheimer's, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca L", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Russ C", "Last Name": "Hornbeck", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ricardo", "Last Name": "Allegri", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive Neurology, Neuropsychology and Neuropsychiatry, FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Beau M", "Last Name": "Ances", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah B", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Clinical & Translational Science, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia;

This distinction is particularly important as the alERC is one of the earliest cortical regions affected by Alzheimer's pathology and related neurodegeneration. The relative associations of alERC/pmERC with neuropsychological test performance have not been examined. We examined how alERC/pmERC volumes differentially relate to performance on 1) the Modified Rey Auditory Learning Test (ModRey), a verbal memory test designed to assess normal/preclinical populations, 2) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and 3) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center neuropsychological battery. We also examined whether alERC/pmERC volumes correlate with Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. In 65 cognitively healthy (CDR\u00a0= 0) older adults, alERC, but not pmERC, volume was associated with ModRey memory retention. Only alERC volume differentiated between participants who scored above and below the MoCA cutoff score for impairment. Evaluating the MoCA subdomains revealed that alERC was particularly associated with verbal recall. On the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center battery, both alERC and pmERC volumes were associated with Craft story recall and Benson figure copy, but only alERC volume was associated with Craft story retention and semantic fluency. Neither alERC nor pmERC volume correlated with CSF levels of amyloid or tau, and regression analyses showed that alERC volume and CSF amyloid levels were independently associated with ModRey retention performance. Taken together, these results suggest that the alERC is important for memory performance and that alERC volume differences are related to a pattern of neuropsychological test performance (i.e., impairments in episodic memory and semantic fluency) typically seen in clinical Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Amyloid", "Entorhinal cortex", "Memory", "Neuropsychology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size", "Retention, Psychology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lok-Kin", "Last Name": "Yeung", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY.

However, the extent to which cerebrovascular disease represents an independent pathognomonic feature of Alzheimer's disease or directly promotes Alzheimer's pathology is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between white matter hyperintensities and plasma levels of tau and to determine if white matter hyperintensities and tau levels interact to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To confirm that cerebrovascular disease promotes tau pathology, we examined tau fluid biomarker concentrations and pathology in a mouse model of ischaemic injury. Three hundred ninety-one participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (74.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1\u2009years of age) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Participants had measurements of plasma total-tau, cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid, and white matter hyperintensities, and were diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's disease (n\u2009=\u200997), mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u2009186) or cognitively normal control (n\u2009=\u2009108). We tested the relationship between plasma tau concentration and white matter hyperintensity volume across diagnostic groups. We also examined the extent to which white matter hyperintensity volume, plasma tau, amyloid positivity status and the interaction between white matter hyperintensities and plasma tau correctly classifies diagnostic category. Increased white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with higher plasma tau concentration, particularly among those diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer's disease. Presence of brain amyloid and the interaction between plasma tau and white matter hyperintensity volume distinguished Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment participants from controls with 77.6% and 63.3% accuracy, respectively. In 63 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants who came to autopsy (82.33\u2009\u00b1\u20097.18 age at death), we found that higher degrees of arteriosclerosis were associated with higher Braak staging, indicating a positive relationship between cerebrovascular disease and neurofibrillary pathology. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, aged mice that received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, but not sham surgery, had increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid tau concentrations, induced myelin loss, and hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cerebral hemisphere. These findings demonstrate a relationship between cerebrovascular disease, operationalized as white matter hyperintensities, and tau levels, indexed in the plasma, suggesting that hypoperfusive injury promotes tau pathology. This potential causal association is supported by the demonstration that transient cerebral artery occlusion induces white matter damage, increases biofluidic markers of tau, and promotes cerebral tau hyperphosphorylation in older-adult mice.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "plasma biomarkers", "tau", "white matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krystal K", "Last Name": "Laing", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, G.H.

Global brain A\u03b2 burden was ascertained with 18F-Florbetaben Positron Emission Tomography (PET); rsFC was ascertained on 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) among 333 late middle-aged Hispanics adults without dementia in four major brain functional connectivity networks: default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal control network (FPC), salience network (SAL) and dorsal attention network (DAN). We examined the relationship of global brain A\u03b2 with rsFC using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE-\u03b54 genotype. We quantified the non-linear associations both with quadratic terms and by categorizing A\u03b2 into three groups: low A\u03b2, intermediate A\u03b2, and positive A\u03b2.

A major barrier to mapping normal brain aging has been the difficulty in excluding the earliest preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here, before addressing this issue we first imaged a mouse model and learn that the best MRI measure of dendritic spine loss, a known pathophysiological driver of normal aging, is one that relies on the combined use of functional and structural MRI. In the primary study, we then deployed the combined functional-structural MRI measure to investigate over 100 cognitively-normal people from 20-72 years of age. Next, to cover the tail end of aging, in secondary analyses we investigated structural MRI acquired from cognitively-normal people, 60-84 years of age, who were Alzheimer's-free via biomarkers. Collectively, the results from the primary functional-structural study, and the secondary structural studies revealed that the dentate gyrus is a hippocampal region differentially affected by aging, and that the entorhinal cortex is a region most resistant to aging. Across the cortex, the primary functional-structural study revealed and that the inferior frontal gyrus is differentially affected by aging, however, the secondary structural studies implicated other frontal cortex regions.

Increased levels of NfL measured in either cerebrospinal fluid or blood is thought to be a biomarker of neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases. However, there have been limited investigations relating NfL to the concurrent measures of white matter (WM) decline that it should reflect. White matter damage is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that serum levels of NfL would associate with WM lesion volume and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics cross-sectionally in 117 autosomal dominant mutation carriers (MC) compared to 84 non-carrier (NC) familial controls as well as in a subset (N\u00a0=\u00a041) of MC with longitudinal NfL and MRI data. In MC, elevated cross-sectional NfL was positively associated with WM hyperintensity lesion volume, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity and negatively with fractional anisotropy. Greater change in NfL levels in MC was associated with larger changes in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, all indicative of reduced WM integrity. There were no relationships with NfL in NC. Our results demonstrate that blood-based NfL levels reflect WM integrity and supports the view that blood levels of NfL are predictive of WM damage in the brain. This is a critical result in improving the interpretability of NfL as a marker of brain integrity, and for validating this emerging biomarker for future use in clinical and research settings across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Blood-based biomarkers", "Neurodegeneration", "Neurofilament", "Neuroimaging", "White matter"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie A", "Last Name": "Schultz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Pathology & Immunology, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy F", "Last Name": "Strain", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Pathology & Immunology, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adedamola", "Last Name": "Adedokun", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Pathology & Immunology, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Department of Neurology, Department of Pathology & Immunology, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Biostatistics, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Preische", "Affiliation": "DZNE-German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, D-72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany;

The amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration biomarker-only diagnostic framework similarly requires the presence of amyloid beta for a diagnosis on the Alzheimer's continuum. However, medial temporal lobe tau pathology in the absence of amyloid beta is frequently observed at autopsy in cognitively normal individuals, a phenomenon that may reflect a consequence of aging and has been labelled 'primary age-related tauopathy'. Alternatively, others argue that this tauopathy reflects an early stage of the developmental continuum leading to Alzheimer's disease. We used positron emission tomography imaging to investigate amyloid beta and tau positivity and associations with cognition to better inform the conceptualization of biomarker changes in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Five hundred twenty-three individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who had undergone flortaucipir positron emission tomography imaging were selected to derive positron emission tomography positivity thresholds using conditional inference decision tree regression. A subsample of 301 individuals without dementia (i.e. those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment) had also undergone florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging within 12\u2009months and were categorized into one of the four groups based on cortical amyloid and Braak stage I/II tau positivity: A-/T-, A+/T-, A-/T+, or A+/T+. Tau positivity in the absence of amyloid beta positivity (i.e. A-/T+) comprised the largest group, representing 45% of the sample. In contrast, only 6% of the sample was identified as A+/T-, and the remainder of the sample fell into A-/T- (22%) or A+/T+ (27%) categories. A-/T- and A+/T- groups had the best cognitive performances across memory, language and executive function; the A-/T+ group showed small-to-moderate relative decreases in cognition; and the A+/T+ group had the worst cognitive performances. Furthermore, there were negative associations between Braak stage I/II tau values and all cognitive domains only in the A-/T+ and A+/T+ groups, with strongest associations for the A+/T+ group. Among our sample of older adults across the Alzheimer's pathological spectrum, 7-fold fewer individuals have positron emission tomography evidence of amyloid beta pathology in the absence of tau pathology than the converse, challenging prevailing models of amyloid beta's primacy in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Given that cognitive performance in the A-/T+ group was poorer than in individuals without either pathology, our results suggest that medial temporal lobe tau without cortical amyloid beta may reflect an early stage on the Alzheimer's pathological continuum.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "amyloid imaging", "biomarkers", "mild cognitive impairment", "tau imaging"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandra J", "Last Name": "Weigand", "Affiliation": "San Diego State University/University of California San Diego Joint Doctoral Program, San Diego, CA 92182, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine J", "Last Name": "Bangen", "Affiliation": "VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA 92161, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelsey R", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA 92161, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Delano-Wood", "Affiliation": "VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA 92161, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul E", "Last Name": "Gilbert", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark W", "Last Name": "Bondi", "Affiliation": "VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA 92161, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Brain communications", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "31980375", "Title": "Subclinical Hearing Loss is Associated With Depressive Symptoms.", "Abstract": "To assess whether the relationship between hearing and depressive symptoms is present among older adults classified as normal hearing (\u226425 dB).", "Keywords": ["Age-related hearing loss", "clinically significant depressive symptoms", "late life depressive symptoms", "presbycusis"], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Audiometry, Pure-Tone", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Presbycusis", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (JSG), Columbia University, New York, NY.

The extent to which diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine younger participants (age = 25.8 \u00b1 2.8 years) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9 \u00b1 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions frequently segmented as WMH in older adults.

Characterization of non-disease associated cognitive changes is crucial to gain a more complete understanding of brain aging. Episodic memory was investigated in 13,037 ethnically diverse elderly (ages 72 to 85 years) with two to 15 years of follow-up, and with known dementia status, age, sex, education, and APOE genotypes. Adjusted trajectories of episodic memory performance over time were estimated using Latent Class Mixed Models. Analysis was conducted using two samples at baseline evaluation: i) non-cognitively impaired individuals, and ii) all individuals regardless of dementia status. We calculated the age-specific annual incidence rates of dementia in the non-demented elderly (n = 10,220). Two major episodic memory trajectories were estimated: 1) Stable-consisting of individuals exhibiting a constant or improved memory function, and 2) Decliner-consisting of individuals whose memory function declined. The majority of the study participants maintain their memory performance over time. Compared to those with Stable trajectory, individuals characterized as Decliners were more likely to have non-white ethnic background, fewer years of education, a higher frequency of \u03b54 allele at APOE gene and five times more likely to develop dementia. The steepest decline in episodic memory was observed in Caribbean-Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites (p = 4.3 x 10(-15)). The highest incident rates of dementia were observed in the oldest age group, among those of Caribbean-Hispanics ancestry and among Decliners who exhibited rates five times higher than those with Stable trajectories (11 per 100 person-years versus 3 per 100 person-years.

The causes of this health disparity remain elusive, partially because of the relative limited capacity for biomedical research in the developing countries that comprise Caribbean Latin America. To begin to address this issue, we were awarded a Development Research Award from the US NIH and Fogarty International Center in order to establish the local capacity to integrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic, establish collaborations with Dominican investigators, and conduct a pilot study on the role of cerebrovascular markers in the clinical expression of AD. Ninety older adult participants with and without AD dementia and with and without a strong family history of AD dementia received MRI scans and clinical evaluation. We quantified markers of cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], presence of infarct, and presence of microbleed) and neurodegeneration (entorhinal cortex volume) and compared them across groups. Patients with AD dementia had smaller entorhinal cortex and greater WMH volumes compared with controls, regardless of family history status. This study provides evidence for the capacity to conduct MRI studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that small vessel cerebrovascular disease represents a core feature of AD dementia, as affected participants had elevated WMH volumes irrespective of family history status.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "developing countries", "neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Dominican Republic", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Pilot Projects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angel", "Last Name": "Piriz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa A", "Last Name": "Guzman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fawad", "Last Name": "Viqar", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irene B", "Last Name": "Meier", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Mena", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Dashnaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Campos", "Affiliation": "Centro de Radiologia Especializada, Santiago, Dominican Republic."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Medrano", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Mother and Teacher Pontifical Catholic University, Santiago, Dominican Republic."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Lantigua", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30251362", "Title": "Sleep and subjective cognitive decline in cognitively healthy elderly: Results from two cohorts.", "Abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline may reflect a dementia prodrome or modifiable risk factor such as sleep disturbance. What is the association between sleep and subjective cognitive decline? Cross-sectional design, from two studies of older adults: the WHICAP in the USA and the HELIAD in Greece. A total of 1,576 WHICAP and 1,456 HELIAD participants, without mild cognitive impairment, dementia or severe depression/anxiety, were included. Participants were mostly women, with 12 (WHICAP) and 8 (HELIAD) mean years of education. Sleep problems were estimated using the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a structured complaint questionnaire that queries for subjective memory and other cognitive symptoms. Multinomial or logistic regression models were used to examine whether sleep problems were associated with complaints about general cognition, memory, naming, orientation and calculations. Age, sex, education, sleep medication, use of medications affecting cognition, co-morbidities, depression and anxiety were used as co-variates. Objective cognition was also estimated by summarizing neuropsychological performance into composite z-scores. Sleep problems were associated with two or more complaints: WHICAP: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001; HELIAD: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001. Sleep problems were associated with complaints in all the cognitive subcategories, except orientation for the WHICAP. The associations were noted regardless of objective cognition. At any given level of objective cognition, sleep disturbance is accompanied by subjective cognitive impairment. The replicability in two ethnically, genetically and culturally different cohorts adds validity to our results.

This revision will have substantial implications for future Alzheimer's research, and the changes should be rigorously evaluated before widespread adoption.

The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging.

A\u03b2 (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.45, p\u00a0= 0.018) and white matter hyperintensities (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.40, p\u00a0= 0.046) were independently and interactively (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.49, p\u00a0= 0.026) associated with a higher ratio of mI over NAA (mI/NAA) in the posterior cingulate and precuneus gray matter but not in the white matter.

WM microstructural characteristics, measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are different in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and WM hyperintensities (WMH). It is largely unknown how the microstructural properties of WMH are associated with cognition and if there are regional effects for specific cognitive domains. We therefore examined within 200 healthy older participants (a) differences in microstructural characteristics of NAWM and WMH per cerebral lobe; and (b) the association of macrostructural (WMH volume) and microstructural characteristics (within NAWM and WMH separately) of each lobe with measures of executive function and processing speed. Multi-modal imaging (i.e., T1, DTI, and FLAIR) was used to assess WM properties. The Stroop and the Trail Making Test were used to measure inhibition, task-switching (both components of executive function), and processing speed. We observed that age was associated with deterioration of white matter microstructure of the NAWM, most notably in the frontal lobe. Older participants had larger WMH volumes and lowest fractional anisotropy values within WMH were found in the frontal lobe. Task-switching was associated with cerebral NAWM volume and NAWM volume of all lobes. Processing speed was associated with total NAWM volume, and microstructural properties of parietal NAWM, the parietal WMH, and the temporal NAWM. Task-switching was related to microstructural properties of WMH of the frontal lobe and WMH volume of the parietal lobe. Our results confirm that executive functioning and processing speed are uniquely associated with macro- and microstructural properties of NAWM and WMH. We further demonstrate for the first time that these relationships differ by lobar region.

High-resolution structural MRI was collected on 680 non-demented elderly (mean age 80.1years) participants of a community-based, multiethnic cohort. Approximately three quarters of these participants also had peripheral inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL6, and ACT) measured using ELISA. Structural measures including brain volumes and cortical thickness (with both global and regional measures) were derived from MRI scans, and repeated MRI measures were obtained after 4.5years. Mean fractional anisotropy was used as the indicator of white matter integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging. We examined the association of inflammatory biomarkers with brain volume, cortical thickness, and white matter integrity using regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, APOE genotype, and intracranial volume. A doubling in CRP (b=-2.48, p=0.002) was associated with a smaller total gray matter volume, equivalent to approximately 1.5years of aging. A doubling in IL6 was associated with smaller total brain volume (b=-14.96, p<0.0001), equivalent to approximately 9years of aging. Higher IL6 was also associated with smaller gray matter (b=-6.52, p=0.002) and white matter volumes (b=-7.47, p=0.004). The volumes of most cortical regions including frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal, as well as subcortical regions including pallidum and thalamus were associated with IL6. In a model additionally adjusted for depression, vascular factors, BMI, and smoking status, the association between IL6 and brain volumes remained, and a doubling in ACT was marginally associated with 0.054 (p=0.001) millimeter thinner mean cortical thickness, equivalent to that of approximately 2.7years of aging. None of the biomarkers was associated with mean fractional anisotropy or longitudinal change of brain volumes and thickness. Among older adults, increased circulating inflammatory biomarkers were associated with smaller brain volume and cortical thickness but not the white matter tract integrity. Our preliminary findings suggest that peripheral inflammatory processes may be involved in the brain atrophy in the elderly.", "Keywords": ["Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin", "Brain atrophy", "Brain morphometry", "C-reactive protein", "Cortical thickness", "Interleukin-6", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neuroepidemiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "White Matter", "alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yian", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; The Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200\u2009kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155). Our findings suggest novel biological pathways through which human genetic variation influences hippocampal volume and risk for neuropsychiatric illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glycoproteins", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Organ Size", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Derrek P", "Last Name": "Hibar", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hieab H H", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Neda", "Last Name": "Jahanshad", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "INSERM Unit U1219, University of Bordeaux, 33076 Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Jason L", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edith", "Last Name": "Hofer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Clinical Division of Neurogeriatrics, Medical University Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 22, 8036 Graz, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Miguel E", "Last Name": "Renteria", "Affiliation": "QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland 4006, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Joshua C", "Last Name": "Bis", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 1730 Minor Avenue/Suite 1360.

"Abstract": "Progressive neurovasculopathy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) results in decreased cognitive function and quality of life (QoL). Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is believed to halt progression of neurovasculopathy. Quantitative analysis of T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden provides a meaningful estimate of small vessel cerebrovascular disease. We asked if quantitative analysis of WMH could complement standardized clinical assessment of MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for assessing SCD central nervous system vasculopathy before and after HCT. Retrospective longitudinal clinical examination of scheduled annual MRI/MRA and quantitative analysis of WMH were performed before and 1 to 7 years after HCT at scheduled annual intervals, along with QoL measurements, in children who had engrafted after HCT. Of 18 patients alive and persistently engrafted (median age, 9.1 years), pretransplantation MRI demonstrated that 9 and 5 had sickle-related stroke and/or small infarcts, respectively. Patients were divided into WMH severity tertiles based on pretransplantation WMH volumes. MRI and WMH were assessed 1 to 7 years after HCT. MRI/MRA and WMH volume were stable or slightly better in 17 of 18 patients. By parent- and self-report, post-HCT QoL improved for children in the lowest WMH tertile significantly more than in the other groups. Based on this single-institution retrospective sample, we report that WMH appears to quantitatively support MRI-based findings that HCT stabilizes long-term small and large vessel cerebrovascular changes and is associated with the degree of improved QoL. While confirmation in larger prospective studies and evaluation by neurocognitive testing are needed, these findings suggest that WMH is a useful biomarker of neurovasculopathy after transplantation for SCD.", "Keywords": ["Hematopoietic cell transplantation", "Magnetic resonance imaging brain", "Quality of life", "Sickle cell disease", "White matter hyperintensity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height.

subjects at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may reflect neuronal dysfunction within the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCP) region. To investigate a potential association between cerebral neurometabolism and low episodic memory in the absence of cognitive impairment, tissue-specific magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at ultrahigh field strength of 7\u00a0Tesla was used to investigate the PCP region in a healthy elderly study population (n\u00a0= 30, age 70 \u00b1 5.7\u00a0years, Mini-Mental State Examination 29.4 \u00b1 4.1). The Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT) was administered as part of a neuropsychological battery for assessment of episodic memory performance. Significant differences between PCP gray and white matter could be observed for glutamate-glutamine (p\u00a0= 0.001), choline (p\u00a0= 0.01), and myo-inositol (p\u00a0= 0.02). Low Verbal Learning and Memory Test performance was associated with high N-acetylaspartate in PCP gray matter (p\u00a0= 0.01) but not in PCP white matter. Our data suggest that subtle decreases in episodic memory performance in the elderly may be associated with increased levels of N-acetylaspartate as a reflection of increased mitochondrial energy capacity in PCP gray matter.", "Keywords": ["7\u00a0Tesla", "Aging", "Episodic memory", "Human subjects", "Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging", "Posterior cingulate"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Aspartic Acid", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Mitochondria"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simon J", "Last Name": "Schreiner", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Kirchner", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Wyss", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Jiri M G", "Last Name": "Van Bergen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Frances C", "Last Name": "Quevenco", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie C", "Last Name": "Steininger", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Erica Y", "Last Name": "Griffith", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irene", "Last Name": "Meier", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Michels", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Anton F", "Last Name": "Gietl", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Sandra E", "Last Name": "Leh", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Hock", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Roger M", "Last Name": "Nitsch", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Klaas P", "Last Name": "Pruessmann", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Anke", "Last Name": "Henning", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul G", "Last Name": "Unschuld", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Hospital for Psychogeriatric Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

This study sought to determine the frequency of neurologic injury, cerebral ischemic lesions, and cognitive dysfunction in subjects undergoing contemporary commercial TAVI in the United States. Neuro-TAVR is the first prospective, multicenter study to use serial systematic neurologic and cognitive assessments and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (at 4 \u00b1 2\u00a0days after procedure) to investigate the incidence and severity of neurologic injury after contemporary unprotected TAVI in the United States. A total of 44 consecutive patients underwent TAVI at 5 US sites. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging lesions were detected in 94%, with a mean of 10.4 \u00b1 15.3 lesions per subject and a median total lesion volume of 295\u00a0mm3 (interquartile range 71.6 to 799.6\u00a0mm3). New neurologic impairment (worsening in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score from baseline with new cerebral lesions) occurred in 22.6% (7 of 31) of subjects at discharge and 14.8% (4 of 27) at 30\u00a0days. In addition, cognitive decrements from baseline were identified by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 33% (12 of 36) of subjects at discharge and 41% (13 of 32) at 30\u00a0days. In conclusion, this contemporary cohort of US patients confirms that TAVI results in cerebral infarction in most patients and that 1 in 5 patients have measurable neurologic impairment and 1 in 3 patients have decrease in cognitive measures by Montreal Cognitive Assessment score after TAVI, reinforcing the need for methods to mitigate the risk of brain injury during TAVI.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aortic Valve", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Brain", "Brain Ischemia", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Intracranial Embolism", "Male", "Postoperative Complications", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandra J", "Last Name": "Lansky", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut; Department of Cardiology, Yale Cardiovascular Research Group, New Haven, Connecticut.

Cardiovascular risk factors were measured over 12 years, and gray matter CBF was measured at the end of the study from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging using arterial spin labeling. The association between cardiovascular risk factors, their long-term change, and CBF was assessed using multivariate linear regression models. Women were observed to have higher CBF than men (p < 0.05). Increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) over the 12-year period was correlated with a low cerebral blood flow (p < 0.05, R(2)\u00a0= 0.21), whereas no association was detected between CBF and MAP at the time of imaging.

disorders. Substantial variation in quantitative methods to measure brain amyloid burden exists in the field. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of methodological variations to the quantification of amyloid burden using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population. Cross-sectional and longitudinal [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed. Four candidate reference regions were investigated for estimation of brain amyloid burden. A regional spread function based technique was also investigated for the correction of partial volume effects. Cerebellar cortex, brain-stem, and white matter regions all had stable tracer retention during the course of disease. Partial volume correction consistently improves sensitivity to group differences and longitudinal changes over time. White matter referencing improved statistical power in the detecting longitudinal changes in relative tracer retention; however, the reason for this improvement is unclear and requires further investigation. Full dynamic acquisition and kinetic modeling improved statistical power although it may add cost and time. Several technical variations to amyloid burden quantification were examined in this study. Partial volume correction emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences. For the autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with partial volume correction may be optimal for current interventional trials. Further investigation of technical issues in quantitative amyloid imaging in different study populations using different amyloid imaging tracers is warranted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult",

It is now recognized that cerebrovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases all play major roles in the evolution of cognitive impairment and dementia. Thus with our more recent recognition of these relationships and our need to understand and more positively impact on this world health problem, \"The Leo and Anne Albert Charitable Trust\" (Gene Pranzo, Trustee with significant support from Susan Brogan, Meeting Planner) provided generous support for this inaugural international workshop that was held from April 13-16, 2015 at the beautiful Ritz Carlton Golf Resort in North Naples, Florida. Researchers from SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY organized the event by selecting the present group of translationally inclined preclinical, clinical and population scientists focused on cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk and its progression to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia. Participants at the workshop addressed important issues related to aging, cognition and dementia by: (1) sharing new data, information and perspectives that intersect vascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, (2) discussing gaps in translating population risk, clinical and preclinical information to the progression of cognitive loss, and (3) debating new approaches and methods to fill these gaps that can translate into future therapeutic interventions. Participants agreed on topics for group discussion prior to the meeting and focused on specific translational goals that included promoting better understanding of dementia mechanisms, the identification of potential therapeutic targets for intervention, and discussed/debated the potential utility of diagnostic/prognostic markers. Below summarizes the new data-presentations, concepts, novel directions and specific discussion topics addressed by this international translational team at our \"First Leo and Anne Albert Charitable Trust 'Think Tank' VCI workshop\".", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Cognition Disorders", "Dementia", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Mice", "Rats", "Translational Research, Biomedical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Frank C", "Last Name": "Barone", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. frank.barone@downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Gustafson", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. deborah.gustafson@downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Howard A", "Last Name": "Crystal", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. howard.crystal@downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Herman", "Last Name": "Moreno", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. herman.moreno@downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mateusz G", "Last Name": "Adamski", "Affiliation": "Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. adamskimateusz@yahoo.com."}, {"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Arai", "Affiliation": "Neuroprotection Research Laboratory, Departments of Radiology and Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, CharlesTown, Boston, MA, USA. karai@mgh.harvard.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alison E", "Last Name": "Baird", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. alison.baird@Downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Clotilde", "Last Name": "Balucani", "Affiliation": "Neurology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. clotilde.balucani@downstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. amb2139@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Cechetto", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada. cechetto@uwo.ca."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Gorelick", "Affiliation": "Translational Science and Molecular Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Mercy Health Hauenstein Neurosciences, Grand Rapids, MI, USA. pgorelic@trinity-health.org."}, {"First Name": "Geert Jan", "Last Name": "Biessels", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. g.j.biessels@umcutrecht.nl."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Kiliaan", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Preclinical Imaging Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

The authors determined the brain regions associated with factors underlying DSM-IV diagnoses and compared the ability of DSM-IV diagnoses, factor scores, and self-report measures to account for the neuroanatomical findings in patients with penetrating brain injuries. This prospective cohort study included 254 Vietnam War veterans: 199 with penetrating brain injuries and 55 matched control participants. Measures include DSM-IV diagnoses (from a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM), self-report measures of depression and anxiety, and CT scans. Factors underlying DSM-IV diagnoses were determined using an exploratory factor analysis and correlated with percent of brain regions affected. The ability of the factor scores, DSM-IV diagnoses, and the self-report psychiatric measures to account for the anatomical variance was compared with multiple regressions. Internalizing and externalizing factors were identified in these brain-injured patients. Damage to the left amygdala and bilateral basal ganglia was associated with lower internalizing factor scores, and damage to the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with higher, and bilateral hippocampi with lower, externalizing factor scores. Factor scores best predicted left amygdala and bilateral hippocampal involvement, whereas DSM-IV diagnoses best predicted bilateral basal ganglia and left OFC involvement. Damage to the limbic areas involved in the processing of emotional and reward information, including structures involved in the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria Negative Valence Domain, influences the development of internalizing and externalizing psychiatric symptoms. Self-report measures underperformed DSM-IV and factor scores in predicting neuroanatomical findings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anxiety", "Brain", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Depression", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "From the Taub Institute and Gertrude H.

Fortunately, neurocognitive dysfunction in HF can be mitigated by physical activity (PA), though mechanisms for this phenomenon are unclear. PA is protective against age-related cognitive decline that may involve improved structural integrity to brain regions sensitive to aging (e.g., subcortical structures). Yet, no study has examined the benefits of PA on the brain in HF and we sought to do so and clarify related cognitive implications. Fifty older adults with HF completed a neuropsychological battery and wore an accelerometer for 7 days. All participants underwent brain MRI. This study targeted subcortical brain volume given subcortical alterations are often observed in HF and the sensitivity of PA to subcortical structures in other patient populations. Participants averaged 4348.49 (SD=2092.08) steps per day and greater daily steps predicted better attention/executive function, episodic memory, and language abilities, p's<.05. Medical and demographically adjusted regression analyses revealed higher daily steps per day predicted greater subcortical volume, with specific effects for the thalamus and ventral diencephalon, p's<.05. Greater subcortical volume was associated with better attention/executive function, p<.05.

A longitudinal application.", "Abstract": "Cognitive reserve describes the mismatch between brain integrity and cognitive performance. Older adults with high cognitive reserve are more resilient to age-related brain pathology. Traditionally, cognitive reserve is indexed indirectly via static proxy variables (e.g., years of education). More recently, cross-sectional studies have suggested that reserve can be expressed as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). The present study extends these methods to a longitudinal framework in a community-based cohort of 244 older adults who underwent two comprehensive neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging sessions over 4.6 years. On average, residual memory variance decreased over time, consistent with the idea that cognitive reserve is depleted over time. Individual differences in change in residual memory variance predicted incident dementia, independent of baseline residual memory variance.

These results suggest that changes in residual memory variance may capture a dynamic aspect of cognitive reserve and could be a useful way to summarize individual cognitive responses to brain changes.

As positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have limited spatial resolution, measured signals are distorted by partial volume effects. Various techniques have been proposed for correcting partial volume effects, but there is no consensus as to whether these techniques are necessary in amyloid imaging, and, if so, how they should be implemented. We evaluated a two-component partial volume correction technique and a regional spread function technique using both simulated and human Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging data. Both correction techniques compensated for partial volume effects and yielded improved detection of subtle changes in PiB retention. However, the regional spread function technique was more accurate in application to simulated data. Because PiB retention estimates depend on the correction technique, standardization is necessary to compare results across groups. Partial volume correction has sometimes been avoided because it increases the sensitivity to inaccuracy in image registration and segmentation.

Bootstrap algorithms have been introduced to provide a non-parametric method to estimate the uncertainty of the measured diffusion parameters. To quantify the variability of the principal diffusion direction, bootstrap-derived metrics such as the cone of uncertainty have been proposed. However, bootstrap-derived metrics are not independent of the underlying diffusion profile. A higher mean diffusivity causes a smaller signal-to-noise ratio and, thus, increases the measurement uncertainty. Moreover, the goodness of the tensor model, which relies strongly on the complexity of the underlying diffusion profile, influences bootstrap-derived metrics as well. The presented simulations clearly depict the cone of uncertainty as a function of the underlying diffusion profile. Since the relationship of the cone of uncertainty and common diffusion parameters, such as the mean diffusivity and the fractional anisotropy, is not linear, the cone of uncertainty has a different sensitivity. In vivo analysis of the fornix reveals the cone of uncertainty to be a predictor of memory function among older adults. No significant correlation occurs with the common diffusion parameters. The present work not only demonstrates the cone of uncertainty as a function of the actual diffusion profile, but also discloses the cone of uncertainty as a sensitive predictor of memory function.

Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD.

In addition to grey matter pathology, white matter changes are now recognized as an important pathological feature in the emergence of the disease. Despite growing recognition of the importance of white matter abnormalities in the pathogenesis of AD, the causes of white matter degeneration are still unknown. While multiple studies propose Wallerian-like degeneration as the source of white matter change, others suggest that primary white matter pathology may be due, at least in part, to other mechanisms, including local effects of toxic A\u03b2 peptides. In the current study, we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in white matter of AD patients (n=12) compared with controls (n=10). Fresh frozen white matter samples were obtained from anterior (Brodmann area 9) and posterior (Brodmann area 1, 2 and 3) areas of post-mortem AD and control brains. ELISA was used to examine levels of soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. Total cortical neuritic plaque severity rating was derived from individual ratings in the following areas of cortex: mid-frontal, superior temporal, pre-central, inferior parietal, hippocampus (CA1), subiculum, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, amygdala and basal forebrain. Compared with controls, AD samples had higher white matter levels of both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. While no regional white matter differences were found in A\u03b2 -40, A\u03b2 -42 levels were higher in anterior regions than in posterior regions across both groups. After statistically controlling for total cortical neuritic plaque severity, differences in both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40 between the groups remained, suggesting that white matter A\u03b2 peptides accumulate independent of overall grey matter fibrillar amyloid pathology and are not simply a reflection of overall amyloid burden. These results shed light on one potential mechanism through which white matter degeneration may occur in AD. Given that white matter degeneration may be an early marker of disease, preceding grey matter atrophy, understanding the mechanisms and risk factors that may lead to white matter loss could help to identify those at high risk and to intervene earlier in the pathogenic process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Plaque, Amyloid", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lyndsey E", "Last Name": "Collins-Praino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yitshak I", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erica Y", "Last Name": "Griffith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne F", "Last Name": "Wiegman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Urbach", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arlene", "Last Name": "Lawton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence S", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Etty", "Last Name": "Cortes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul G", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York 10032, NY, USA. amb2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2014Aug17"}, {"PMID": "25091451", "Title": "Cerebral microbleeds in a multiethnic elderly community: demographic and clinical correlates.", "Abstract": "Microbleeds, small perivascular collections of hemosiderin manifested radiologically as hypointensities on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are important markers of small vessel pathology.

Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carrier individuals have elevated PiB levels in nearly every cortical region 15 y before the estimated age of onset. Reduced cortical glucose metabolism and cortical thinning in the medial and lateral parietal lobe appeared 10 and 5 y, respectively, before estimated age of onset. Importantly, however, a divergent pattern was observed subcortically. All subcortical gray-matter regions exhibited elevated PiB uptake, but despite this, only the hippocampus showed reduced glucose metabolism. Similarly, atrophy was not observed in the caudate and pallidum despite marked amyloid accumulation. Finally, before hypometabolism, a hypermetabolic phase was identified for some cortical regions, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate.

Over the past 3 decades, advances in the understanding of the biology of AD have led to a somewhat unified hypothesis of disease pathogenesis that emphasizes the precipitating role of beta amyloid protein. However, several lines of evidence suggest that multiple pathologies are necessary for clinical manifestation of the disease. Our focus over the past several years has been on the contribution of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging, to AD. White matter hyperintensity volume, particularly in parietal regions, is elevated among individuals with and at risk for AD, predicts future diagnosis of AD, predicts the rate of progression of cognitive symptoms among individuals with AD, and increases over time among individuals destined to develop AD.

Late adolescence provides a unique opportunity to study how the attainment of socioeconomic status (in the form of years of education) relates to cognitive and neural development, during a time when age-related cognitive and neural development is ongoing. During late adolescence it is possible to disambiguate age- and education-related effects on the development of these processes. Here we assessed the degree to which higher educational attainment was related to performance on a cognitive control task, controlling for age. We then used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the degree to which white matter microstructure might mediate this relationship. When covarying age, significant associations were found between educational attainment and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle (CB). Further, when covarying age, FA in these regions was associated with cognitive control. Finally, mediation analyses revealed that the age-independent association between educational attainment and cognitive control was completely accounted for by FA in these regions.

This residual variance represents the discrepancy between an individual\u2019s predicted and actual memory performance. The goals of the present study were to extend these methods to a larger, community-based sample and to investigate whether the residual reserve variable is explained by age, predicts longitudinal changes in language, and predicts dementia conversion independent of age. Results support this operational measure of reserve. The residual reserve variable was associated with higher reading ability, lower likelihood of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment, lower odds of dementia conversion in dependent of age, and less decline in language abilities over 3 years. Finally, the residual reserve variable moderated the negative impact of memory variance explained by brain pathology on language decline.

Under a dominant genetic model, the language subgroup had smaller odds of carrying at least one APOE\u03b54 allele relative to the memory subgroup.

We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to (1) confirm whether entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume are associated with memory among individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD; and (2) determine whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, a radiological marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, is associated with entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume independent of putative AD biomarkers in this group.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Tau", "White matter hyperintensities", "\u03b2-amyloid"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Models, Statistical", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vanessa A", "Last Name": "Guzman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen T", "Last Name": "Carmichael", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Schwarz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Molly E", "Last Name": "Zimmerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23220414", "Title": "Regional vulnerability in Huntington's disease: fMRI-guided molecular analysis in patients and a mouse model of disease.", "Abstract": "Although the huntingtin gene is expressed in brain throughout life, phenotypically Huntington's disease (HD) begins only in midlife and affects specific brain regions. Here, to investigate regional vulnerability in the disease, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to translationally link studies in patients with a mouse model of disease. Using fMRI, we mapped cerebral blood volume (CBV) in three groups: HD patients, symptom-free carriers of the huntingtin genetic mutation, and age-matched controls. In contrast to a region in the anterior caudate, in which dysfunction was linked to genotype independent of phenotype, a region in the posterior body of the caudate was differentially associated with disease phenotype. Guided by these observations, we harvested regions from the anterior and posterior body of the caudate in postmortem control and HD human brain tissue. Gene-expression profiling identified two molecules whose expression levels were most strongly correlated with regional vulnerability - protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7 (PPP1R7) and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1). To verify and potentially extend these findings, we turned to the YAC128 (C57BL/6J) HD transgenic mice. By fMRI we longitudinally mapped CBV in transgenic and wildtype (WT) mice, and over time, abnormally low fMRI signal emerged selectively in the dorsal striatum. A relatively unaffected brain region, primary somatosensory cortex (S1), was used as a control. Both dorsal striatum and S1 were harvested from transgenic and WT mice and molecular analysis confirmed that PPP1R7 deficiency was strongly correlated with the phenotype. Together, converging findings in human HD patients and this HD mouse model suggest a functional pattern of caudate vulnerability and that variation in expression levels of herein identified molecules correlate with this pattern of vulnerability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Corpus Striatum", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phenotype", "Protein Phosphatase 1", "Repressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole M", "Last Name": "Lewandowski", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvette", "Last Name": "Bordelon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Angulo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Usman", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan", "Last Name": "Muraskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erica Y", "Last Name": "Griffith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Wasserman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liliana", "Last Name": "Menalled", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Marder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Herman", "Last Name": "Moreno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23128969", "Title": "White matter hyperintensity volume and impaired mobility among older adults.", "Abstract": "Gait speed is associated with multiple adverse outcomes of aging. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been associated with gait speed, though few studies have examined changes in gait speed over time in population-based studies comprising participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between a decline in gait speed and total and regional WMH volumes in a community-based study of aging. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0701) underwent gait-speed measurement via a 4-m walk test at the time of initial enrollment and MRI at a second time interval (mean 4.7 [SD\u00a0=\u00a00.5] years apart). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between large WMH volume and regional WMH volume with gait speed <0.5\u00a0m/s (abnormal speed), and a transition to abnormal gait speed. Analyses were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Large WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and a transition to abnormal gait speed between the two visits, but not after adjustment for modifiable vascular disease risk factors. Increased frontal lobe WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and transition to abnormal gait speed, but not in adjusted models. WMH are associated with slowing of gait over time.

Whether cognitive changes are the result of variations in brain measures remains unclear and relating the two across the lifespan poses a unique set of problems. It must be determined whether statistical associations between cognitive and brain measures truly exist and are not epiphenomenal due solely to their shared relationships with age. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) and gray matter volume (GMV) measures make unique and better predictions of cognition than age alone. Multivariate analyses identified brain-wide covariance patterns from 35 healthy young and 23 healthy older adults using MRI-derived measures of CBF and GMV related to three cognitive composite scores (i.e., memory, fluid ability, and speed/attention). These brain-cognitive relationships were consistent across the age range, and not the result of epiphenomenal associations with age and each imaging modality provided its own unique information. The CBF and GMV patterns each accounted for unique aspects of cognition and accounted for nearly all the age-related variance in the cognitive composite scores. The findings suggest that measures derived from multiple imaging modalities explain larger amounts of variance in cognition providing a more complete understanding of the aging brain.", "Keywords": ["aging", "cerebral blood flow", "cognitive decline", "gray matter volume", "multiple modality imaging", "multivariate analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Attention", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cognition", "Cyclic N-Oxides", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Problem Solving", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Steffener", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Department of Neurology, Columbia University of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian G", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy A", "Last Name": "Salthouse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human brain mapping", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}]
