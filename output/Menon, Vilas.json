Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence. These results provide important insights into transcriptional dysregulation in xenografted APPV717I neurons linked to synaptic function, and they indicate that LINGO2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Disease modeling", "Grafts", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "Transplantation", "iPSCs", "snRNA-seq"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "Animals", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Mutation", "Membrane Proteins", "Synapses", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Mares", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed A", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. vm2545@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38889126", "Title": "Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these \"mind-mitochondria\" associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes.", "Keywords": ["mitochondria", "proteome", "psychosocial factors", "single cell RNA-seq",

Much of our understanding of senescent cell biology still originates from tissue culture studies, where each cell in the culture is driven to an irreversible cell cycle arrest. By contrast, in tissues, these cells are relatively rare and difficult to characterize, and it is now established that fully differentiated, postmitotic cells can also acquire a senescence phenotype. The SenNet Biomarkers Working Group was formed to provide recommendations for the use of cellular senescence markers to identify and characterize senescent cells in tissues. Here, we provide recommendations for detecting senescent cells in different tissues based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature reporting senescence markers in 14 tissues in mice and humans. We discuss some of the recent advances in detecting and characterizing cellular senescence, including molecular senescence signatures and morphological features, and the use of circulating markers.

In this study, we utilized a single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset from Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLFPC) of 424 donors from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) to investigate the effect of 10 VEGF genes ( VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, PGF, FLT1, FLT4, KDR, NRP1 , and NRP2 ) on AD endophenotypes. Mean age of death was 89 years, among which 68% were females, and 52% has AD dementia. Negative binomial mixed models were used for differential expression analysis and for association analysis with \u03b2-amyloid load, PHF tau tangle density, and both cross-sectional and longitudinal global cognitive function. Intercellular VEGF-associated signaling was profiled using CellChat. We discovered prefrontal cortical FLT1 expression was upregulated in AD brains in both endothelial and microglial cells. Higher FLT1 expression was also associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and \u03b2-amyloid load. Similarly, higher endothelial FLT4 expression was associated with more \u03b2-amyloid load. In contrast to the receptors, VEGFB showed opposing effects on \u03b2-amyloid load whereby higher levels in oligodendrocytes was associated with high amyloid burden, while higher levels in inhibitory neurons was associated with lower amyloid burden. Finally, AD cells showed significant reduction in overall VEGF signaling comparing to those from cognitive normal participants. Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yiyang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia B", "Last Name": "Libby", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Logan", "Last Name": "Dumitrescu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Hohman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May22"}, {"PMID": "38750228", "Title": "G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1, amyloid-\u03b2, and tau tangles in older adults.", "Abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 is extracellular while tau tangles are typically intracellular, and it is unknown how these two proteinopathies are connected. Here, we use data of 1206 elders and test that RNA expression levels of GPER1, a transmembrane protein, modify the association of A\u03b2 with tau tangles. GPER1 RNA expression is related to more tau tangles (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Moreover, GPER1 expression modifies the association of immunohistochemistry-derived A\u03b2 load with tau tangles (p\u2009=\u20090.044). Similarly, GPER1 expression modifies the association between A\u03b2 proteoforms and tau tangles: total A\u03b2 protein (p\u2009=\u20090.030) and A\u03b238 peptide (p\u2009=\u20090.002).

A major goal in AD research is to identify new therapeutic pathways by studying the molecular and cellular changes in the disease, either downstream or upstream of the pathological hallmarks. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of cellular heterogeneity from the temporal cortex region of 40 individuals, comprising healthy donors and individuals with differing tau and amyloid burden. Using single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of 430,271 nuclei from both gray and white matter of these individuals, we identified cell type-specific subclusters in both neuronal and glial cell types with varying degrees of association with AD pathology. In particular, these associations are present in layer specific glutamatergic (excitatory) neuronal types, along with GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons and glial subtypes. These associations were observed in early as well as late pathological progression. We extended this analysis by performing multiplexed in situ hybridization using the CARTANA platform, capturing 155 genes in 13 individuals with varying levels of tau pathology. By modeling the spatial distribution of these genes and their associations with the pathology, we not only replicated key findings from our snRNA data analysis, but also identified a set of cell type-specific genes that show selective enrichment or depletion near pathological inclusions.

However, little is known about the extent of synaptic diversity because of the lack of unbiased methods to extract synaptic features among interneuron subtypes. Here, we develop an approach to aggregate image features from fluorescent confocal images of interneuron synapses and their post-synaptic targets, in order to characterize the heterogeneity of synapses at fine scale. We started by training a model that recognizes pre- and post-synaptic compartments and then determines the target of each genetically-identified interneuron synapse in vitro and in vivo. Our model extracts hundreds of spatial and intensity features from each analyzed synapse, constructing a multidimensional data set, consisting of millions of synapses, which allowed us to perform an unsupervised analysis on this dataset, uncovering novel synaptic subgroups. The subgroups were spatially distributed in a highly structured manner that revealed the local underlying topology of the postsynaptic environment. Dendrite-targeting subgroups were clustered onto subdomains of the dendrite along the proximal to distal axis. Soma-targeting subgroups were enriched onto different postsynaptic cell types. We also find that the two main subclasses of interneurons, basket cells and somatostatin interneurons, utilize distinct strategies to enact inhibitory coverage. Thus, our analysis of multidimensional synaptic features establishes a conceptual framework for studying interneuron synaptic diversity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick D", "Last Name": "Dummer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Dylan I", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sakib", "Last Name": "Hossain", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Runsheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andre", "Last Name": "Evard", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Newman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Casey M", "Last Name": "Schneider-Mizell", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle WA, 98109."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Edmund", "Last Name": "Au", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Irving Medical Center, New York NY, 10032."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr17"}, {"PMID": "38626772", "Title": "Osteopontin drives neuroinflammation and cell loss in MAPT-N279K frontotemporal dementia patient neurons.", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains.

Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts.

This new approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain functions, relating it to neuroimaging data, and defining the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.", "Keywords": ["MRI", "OxPhos", "anatomical mapping", "brain voxelization", "mitochondria", "neuroimaging", "phenotyping", "single-cell RNA sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eugene V", "Last Name": "Mosharov", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ayelet M", "Last Name": "Rosenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Monzel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Corey A", "Last Name": "Osto", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "Linsey", "Last Name": "Stiles", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "Gorazd B", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Snehal", "Last Name": "Bindra", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ya", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Madeline B", "Last Name": "Mariani", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mihran", "Last Name": "Bakalian", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Orian S", "Last Name": "Shirihai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "J John", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Underwood", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michel Thiebaut", "Last Name": "de Schotten", "Affiliation": "Brain Connectivity and Behavior Laboratory, Paris, France;

Here, we characterize a set of pharmacological compounds that have been proposed to polarize human microglia towards two distinct states - one enriched for AD and MS genes and another characterized by increased expression of antigen presentation genes. Using different model systems including HMC3 cells, iPSC-derived microglia and cerebral organoids, we characterize the effect of these compounds in mimicking human microglial subtypes in vitro. We show that the Topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin induces a CD74high/MHChigh microglial subtype which is specialized in amyloid beta phagocytosis. Camptothecin suppressed amyloid toxicity and restored microglia back to their homeostatic state in a zebrafish amyloid model.

Heritable factors account for 58-79% of variation in late-onset AD, but substantial variation remains in age-of- onset, disease severity, and whether those with high-risk genotypes acquire AD. To emulate the diversity of human populations, we utilized the AD-BXD mouse panel. This genetically diverse resource combines AD genotypes with multiple BXD strains to discover new genetic drivers of AD resilience. Comparing AD-BXD carriers to noncarrier littermates, we computed a novel quantitative metric for resilience to cognitive decline in the AD-BXDs. Our quantitative AD resilience trait was heritable and genetic mapping identified a locus on chr8 associated with resilience to AD mutations that resulted in amyloid brain pathology. Using a hippocampus proteomics dataset, we nominated the mitochondrial glutathione S reductase protein (GR or GSHR) as a resilience factor, finding that the DBA/2J genotype was associated with substantially higher GR abundance. By mapping protein QTLs (pQTLs), we identified synaptic organization and mitochondrial proteins coregulated in trans with a cis-pQTL for GR. We found four coexpression modules correlated with the quantitative resilience score in aged 5XFAD mice using paracliques, which were related to cell structure, protein folding, and postsynaptic densities. Finally, we found significant positive associations between human GSR transcript abundance in the brain and better outcomes on AD-related cognitive and pathology traits in the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging project (ROSMAP).

However, an important question is the extent to which so-called \"normal-appearing\" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Dylan", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ivy", "Last Name": "Kosater", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Khairallah", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ya", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Sukriti", "Last Name": "Nag", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Dec20"}, {"PMID": "38180982", "Title": "Distinct microglial transcriptomic signatures within the hippocampus.", "Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are crucial in the development of the nervous system. Recent evidence demonstrates that microglia modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation of neural precursors and survival both in vitro and in vivo, thus maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death in the neural stem cell pool. There are increasing reports suggesting these microglia found in neurogenic niches differ from their counterparts in non-neurogenic areas. Here, we present evidence that hippocampal microglia exhibit transcriptomic heterogeneity, with some cells expressing genes associated with neurogenesis. By comprehensively profiling myeloid lineage cells in the hippocampus using single cell RNA-sequencing, we have uncovered a small, yet distinct population of microglia which exhibit depletion in genes associated with homeostatic microglia and enrichment of genes associated with phagocytosis. Intriguingly, this population also expresses a gene signature with substantial overlap with previously characterized phenotypes, including disease associated microglia (DAM), a particularly unique and compelling microglial state.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Microglia", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Transcriptome", "Hippocampus", "Neurogenesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sana", "Last Name": "Chintamen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pallavi", "Last Name": "Gaur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Vo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38141910", "Title": "A Single-Nucleus Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Implicates Novel Genes in Depression Pathogenesis.", "Abstract": "Depression, a common psychiatric illness and global public health problem, remains poorly understood across different life stages, which hampers the development of novel treatments.", "Keywords": ["Depressive symptoms", "Genome-wide association study", "Major depressive disorder", "ROSMAP", "Single-nucleus RNA-seq", "Transcriptome-wide association study"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Male", "Transcriptome", "Female", "Aged", "Depression", "Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Middle Aged", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zongmei", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gilad S", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "Habib", "Affiliation": "Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Boyle", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.

One hallmark of HD is the selective neuronal vulnerability of striatal medium spiny neurons. To date, the underlying mechanisms of this selective vulnerability have not been fully defined. Here, we employed a multi-omic approach including single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq), bulk RNAseq, lipidomics, HTT gene CAG repeat length measurements, and multiplexed immunofluorescence on post-mortem brain tissue from multiple brain regions of HD and control donors. We defined a signature of genes that is driven by CAG repeat length and found it enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. Moreover, weighted gene correlation network analysis showed loss of connectivity of astrocytic and microglial modules in HD and identified modules that correlated with CAG-repeat length which further implicated inflammatory pathways and metabolism. We performed lipidomic analysis of HD and control brains and identified several lipid species that correlate with HD grade, including ceramides and very long chain fatty acids. Integration of lipidomics and bulk transcriptomics identified a consensus gene signature that correlates with HD grade and HD lipidomic abnormalities and implicated the unfolded protein response pathway. Because astrocytes are critical for brain lipid metabolism and play important roles in regulating inflammation, we analyzed our snRNAseq dataset with an emphasis on astrocyte pathology. We found two main astrocyte types that spanned multiple brain regions; these types correspond to protoplasmic astrocytes, and fibrous-like - CD44-positive, astrocytes. HD pathology was differentially associated with these cell types in a region-specific manner. One protoplasmic astrocyte cluster showed high expression of metallothionein genes, the depletion of this cluster positively correlated with the depletion of vulnerable medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus. We confirmed that metallothioneins were increased in cingulate HD astrocytes but were unchanged or even decreased in caudate astrocytes. We combined existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a GWA study conducted on HD patients from the original Venezuelan cohort and identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the metallothionein gene locus associated with delayed age of onset. Functional studies found that metallothionein overexpressing astrocytes are better able to buffer glutamate and were neuroprotective of patient-derived directly reprogrammed HD MSNs as well as against rotenone-induced neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we found that metallothionein-overexpressing astrocytes increased the phagocytic activity of microglia in vitro and increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid binding.

We associated glial, vascular and neuronal subpopulations with AD-related traits for 424 aging individuals, and aligned them along the disease cascade using causal modeling. We identified two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, one contributed to amyloid-\u03b2 proteinopathy while the other mediated the effect of amyloid-\u03b2 in accelerating tau proteinopathy, as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediated the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the coordinated dynamics of the entire cellular environment we devised the BEYOND methodology which uncovered two distinct trajectories of brain aging that are defined by distinct sequences of changes in cellular communities. Older individuals are engaged in one of two possible trajectories, each associated with progressive changes in specific cellular communities that end with: (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain aging.

We found that compared with other spinal neurons, human motoneurons are defined by genes related to cell size, cytoskeletal structure, and ALS, suggesting a specialized molecular repertoire underlying their selective vulnerability.

St18 functions by influencing cell fate in MGE lineages as we observe a large expansion of nascent cortical interneurons at the expense of putative GPe neurons in St18 null embryos.

However, many APOE-\u03b54 carriers remain cognitively normal throughout life, suggesting that neuroprotective factors may be present in these individuals. In this study, we leverage whole-blood RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from 324 older adults to identify genetic modifiers of APOE-\u03b54 effects on cognition. Expression of RNASE6 interacted with APOE-\u03b54 status (p\u00a0=\u00a04.35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) whereby higher RNASE6 expression was associated with worse memory at baseline among APOE-\u03b54 carriers.

Replication in three AD case-control single-nucleus RNAseq datasets most strongly supported the bulk tissue association of fewer SST neurons in AD. In depth analyses of cell type proportions with specific AD-related neuropathological and cognitive phenotypes revealed fewer SST neurons with greater brain-wide post-mortem tau and beta amyloid, as well as a faster rate of antemortem cognitive decline. In contrast, greater IT neuron proportions were associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline as well as greater residual cognition-a measure of cognitive resilience-but not canonical AD neuropathology.

To compare the AD-related molecular pathways between humans and zebrafish, we compared single cell or nuclear transcriptomic data from a zebrafish amyloid toxicity model and its controls (N = 12) with the datasets of two human adult brains (N = 10 and N = 48 (Microglia)), and one fetal brain (N = 10). Approximately 95.4% of the human and zebrafish cells co-clustered. Within each cell type, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched KEGG pathways, and gene ontology terms. We studied synergistic and non-synergistic DEGs to point at either common or uniquely altered mechanisms across species. Using the top DEGs, a high concordance in gene expression changes between species was observed in neuronal clusters. On the other hand, the molecular pathways affected by AD in zebrafish astroglia differed from humans in favor of the neurogenic pathways.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

This decline in homeostatic immune responses was associated with a striking disappearance of circadian gene transcription in aged compared to young tissue macrophages. Chromatin accessibility was significantly greater in young macrophages than in aged macrophages; however, this difference did not explain the loss of rhythmic gene transcription in aged macrophages. Rather, diurnal expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor (TF) well established in regulating cell differentiation and reprogramming, was selectively diminished in aged macrophages. Ablation of Klf4 expression abolished diurnal rhythms in phagocytic activity, recapitulating the effect of aging on macrophage phagocytosis. Examination of individuals harboring genetic variants of KLF4 revealed an association with age-dependent susceptibility to death caused by bacterial infection.

Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.", "Keywords": ["human", "lateral geniculate nucleus", "macaca fascicularis", "maccaca nemestrina", "mouse", "neuroscience", "single-cell RNA-seq", "species comparison"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Nucleus", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Geniculate Bodies", "Humans", "Macaca", "Mice", "Neurons", "RNA-Seq", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Thalamus", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Trygve E", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cindy Tj", "Last Name": "van Velthoven", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca D", "Last Name": "Hodge", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zizhen", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Thuc Nghi", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lucas T", "Last Name": "Graybuck", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gregory D", "Last Name": "Horwitz", "Affiliation": "Washington National Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Darren", "Last Name": "Bertagnolli", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Goldy", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anna Marie", "Last Name": "Yanny", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Garren", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sheana", "Last Name": "Parry", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tamara", "Last Name": "Casper", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Soraya I", "Last Name": "Shehata", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eliza R", "Last Name": "Barkan", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Szafer", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Boaz P", "Last Name": "Levi", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Dee", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kimberly A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susan M", "Last Name": "Sunkin", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Bernard", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Hawrylycz", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christof", "Last Name": "Koch", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gabe J", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ed", "Last Name": "Lein", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hongkui", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bosiljka", "Last Name": "Tasic", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2021Sep02"}, {"PMID": "34393677", "Title": "EPIGENOMIC FEATURES RELATED TO MICROGLIA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENUATED EFFECT OF APOE \u03b54 ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RISK IN HUMANS.", "Abstract": "Not all APOE \u03b54 carriers who survive to advanced age develop Alzheimer's disease (AD); factors attenuating the risk of \u03b54 on AD may exist.

Although prevalent in the brain, the contribution of alternative splicing (AS) to the molecular diversity across neuronal cell types is just starting to emerge. Here, we systematically investigated AS regulation across over 100 transcriptomically defined neuronal types of the adult mouse cortex using deep single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We found distinct splicing programs between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and between subclasses within each neuronal class. These programs consist of overlapping sets of alternative exons showing differential splicing at multiple hierarchical levels. Using an integrative approach, our analysis suggests that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Celf1/2, Mbnl2, and Khdrbs3 are preferentially expressed and more active in glutamatergic neurons, while Elavl2 and Qk are preferentially expressed and more active in GABAergic neurons. Importantly, these and additional RBPs also contribute to differential splicing between neuronal subclasses at multiple hierarchical levels, and some RBPs contribute to splicing dynamics that do not conform to the hierarchical structure defined by the transcriptional profiles. Thus, our results suggest graded regulation of AS across neuronal cell types, which may provide a molecular mechanism to specify neuronal identity and function that are orthogonal to established classifications based on transcriptional regulation.", "Keywords": ["RNA-binding proteins", "alternative splicing", "graded regulation", "neuronal cell type diversity", "single-cell RNA-sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "GABAergic Neurons", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "RNA Splicing", "RNA-Seq", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huijuan", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Daniel F", "Last Name": "Moakley", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shuonan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Melissa G", "Last Name": "McKenzie", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Chaolin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; cz2294@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Mar09"}, {"PMID": "33649316", "Title": "Molecular correlates of muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ afferents.", "Abstract": "Proprioceptive feedback mainly derives from groups Ia and II muscle spindle (MS) afferents and group Ib Golgi tendon organ (GTO) afferents, but the molecular correlates of these three afferent subtypes remain unknown.

This preparatory activity has been observed across cortical layers, including in descending pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5. A key question is how preparatory activity is maintained without causing movement, and is ultimately converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. Here, using single-cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions, we identify two types of pyramidal tract neuron. Both types project to several targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem.

The more complex models have an increased capacity to predict spiking behavior of hold-out stimuli. We use unsupervised methods to classify cell types, and find that high level GLIF model parameters are able to differentiate transgenic lines comparable to electrophysiological features. The more complex model parameters also have an increased ability to differentiate between transgenic lines.

There are multiple experimental approaches to isolate and profile single cells, which provide different levels of cellular and tissue coverage. In addition, multiple computational strategies have been proposed to identify putative cell types from single-cell data. From a data generation perspective, recent single-cell studies can be classified into two groups: those that distribute reads shallowly over large numbers of cells and those that distribute reads more deeply over a smaller cell population. Although there are advantages to both approaches in terms of cellular and tissue coverage, it is unclear whether different computational cell type identification methods are better suited to one or the other experimental paradigm. This study reviews three cell type clustering algorithms, each representing one of three broad approaches, and finds that PCA-based algorithms appear most suited to low read depth data sets, whereas gene clustering-based and biclustering algorithms perform better on high read depth data sets. In addition, highly related cell classes are better distinguished by higher-depth data, given the same total number of reads; however, simultaneous discovery of distinct and similar types is better served by lower-depth, higher cell number data. Overall, this study suggests that the depth of profiling should be determined by initial assumptions about the diversity of cells in the population, and that the selection of clustering algorithm(s) subsequently based on the depth of profiling will allow for better identification of putative transcriptomic cell types.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Cluster Analysis", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus, 19700 Helix Drive, Ashburn, VA, USA."}], "Journal": "Briefings in functional genomics", "PubDate": "2018Jul01"}, {"PMID": "29144976", "Title": "Single-Cell Profiling of an In\u00a0Vitro Model of Human Interneuron Development Reveals Temporal Dynamics of Cell Type Production and Maturation.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennie L", "Last Name": "Close", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhen", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Boaz P", "Last Name": "Levi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy A", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Trygve E", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan T", "Last Name": "Ting", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abigail", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne-Rachel", "Last Name": "Krostag", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elliot R", "Last Name": "Thomsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angel M", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John K", "Last Name": "Mich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca D", "Last Name": "Hodge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Soraya I", "Last Name": "Shehata", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian A", "Last Name": "Glass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Bort", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nadiya V", "Last Name": "Shapovalova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N Kiet", "Last Name": "Ngo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua S", "Last Name": "Grimley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol L", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharad", "Last Name": "Ramanathan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ed", "Last Name": "Lein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuron", "PubDate": "2017Nov15"}, {"PMID": "28296636", "Title": "Discovering sparse transcription factor codes for cell states and state transitions during development.", "Abstract": "Computational analysis of gene expression to determine both the sequence of lineage choices made by multipotent cells and to identify the genes influencing these decisions is challenging.

In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, such mechanisms have indeed been reported, which normalize either the ability of distributed synapses to drive action potential initiation in the axon or their ability to drive dendritic spiking locally. Here we report that these mechanisms can coexist, through an elegant combination of distance-dependent regulation of synapse number and synaptic expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors.

To characterize a homogeneous neuronal population, we use the master equation for generalized leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with shot-noise synapses. We develop fast semi-analytic numerical methods to solve this equation for either current or conductance synapses, with and without synaptic depression. We show that its solutions match simulations of equivalent neuronal networks better than those of the Fokker-Planck equation and we compute bounds on the network response to non-instantaneous synapses. We apply these methods to study different synaptic weight distributions in feed-forward networks. We characterize the synaptic amplitude distributions using a set of measures, called tail weight numbers, designed to quantify the preponderance of very strong synapses. Even if synaptic amplitude distributions are equated for both the total current and average synaptic weight, distributions with sparse but strong synapses produce higher responses for small inputs, leading to a larger operating range. Furthermore, despite their small number, such synapses enable the network to respond faster and with more stability in the face of external fluctuations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Computer Simulation", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ramakrishnan", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Buice", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christof", "Last Name": "Koch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Mihalas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "24131050", "Title": "Dynamic Bayesian clustering.", "Abstract": "Clusters of time series data may change location and memberships over time; in gene expression data, this occurs as groups of genes or samples respond differently to stimuli or experimental conditions at different times.

The current study describes a systematic approach to identify molecular correlates of specific projection neuron classes in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1), using a combination of in situ hybridization (ISH) data mining, marker gene colocalization, and combined retrograde labeling with ISH for layer-specific marker genes. First, we identified a large set of genes with specificity for each cortical layer, and that display heterogeneous patterns within those layers. Using these genes as markers, we find extensive evidence for the covariation of gene expression and projection target specificity in layer 2/3, 5, and 6, with individual genes labeling neurons projecting to specific subsets of target structures. The combination of gene expression and target specificity imply a great diversity of projection neuron classes that is similar to or greater than that of GABAergic interneurons.
