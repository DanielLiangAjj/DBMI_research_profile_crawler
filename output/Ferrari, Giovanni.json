[{"PMID": "38851973", "Title": "Translating knowledge into policy: Organizational model and minimum requirements for the implementation of a regional pancreas unit network.", "Abstract": "Pancreatic and periampullary cancers pose significant challenges in oncological care due to their complexity and diagnostic difficulties. Global experiences underscore the crucial role of multidisciplinary collaboration and centralized care in improving patient outcomes in this context. Recognizing these challenges, Lombardy, Italy's most populous region, embarked on establishing pancreas units across its territory to enhance clinical outcomes and organizational efficiency. This initiative, driven by a multistakeholder approach involving the Lombardy Welfare Directorate, clinicians, and a patient association, emphasizes the centralization of complex care in high-volume hospitals, adopting a hub-and-spoke model and a multidisciplinary approach. This article outlines the process and criteria set forth for pancreas unit implementation, aiming to provide a structured framework for enhancing pancreatic cancer care. Central to this initiative is the establishment of structured criteria and minimal requirements, not only for surgery but also for other essential components of care, ensuring a comprehensive approach to pancreatic cancer management. The Lombardy model offers a structured framework for enhancing pancreatic cancer care, with potential applicability to other regions and countries seeking to improve their cancer care infrastructure.", "Keywords": ["Centralization", "Health policy", "Multidisciplinary team", "Pancreas unit", "Pancreatic cancer"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gianpaolo", "Last Name": "Balzano", "Affiliation": "Division of Pancreatic Surgery, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy.

In recent years there has been a growing trend towards ejaculation preservation. Although the results of TURP (3), and most laser enucleation techniques are undoubted in the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) management, they often lack in the preservation of ejaculation. All the alternative recently proposed interventions (Rezum, AquaBeam, Urolift, TPLA, i-TIND, LEST) are procedures considered by some authors to be promising in both managing BPO and preserving sexual functions.

Various valved conduit options currently exist including homografts, xenograft pulmonary valved conduits (Contegra\u2122), and porcine valved conduits. The major limitation for all conduits is implant durability, which requires reoperation. Currently, cryopreserved homografts are often used given their superiority shown in long-term data. Significant limitations remain in the cost and availability of the graft, particularly for smaller sizes. Contegra conduits are available in a variety of sizes. Nonetheless, the data regarding long-term durability are less robust and studies comparing durability with homografts have been conflicting. Additionally, there is concern for increased rates of late endocarditis in this conduit. Porcine valved conduits offer a reliable option but are limited by structural valve degeneration associated with all types of bioprosthetic heart valve replacements. New developments in the field of tissue engineering have produced promising bio-restorative valved conduits that may overcome many of the limitations of previous conduit technologies. These remain in the early stages of clinical testing.

Spleen-preserving DP was performed in 109 patients (16.3%). Overall incidence of severe complications (Clavien-Dindo\u2009\u2265\u20093) was 17.6% with a 90-day mortality of 1.9%. This registry analysis provided some important information. First, robotic assistance was preferred for all MIPR but DP with splenectomy. Second, robotic assistance reduced conversion to open surgery and blood loss in comparison to laparoscopy. Robotic PD was also associated with lower incidence of severe postoperative complications and a trend toward lower mortality. Fourth, the annual cut-off of\u2009\u2265\u200920 MIPR and\u2009\u2265\u200920 MIPD improved selected outcome measures. Fifth, most MIPR were performed by a single surgeon. Sixth, only two-thirds of the centers performed spleen-preserving DP. Seventh, DP with splenectomy was associated with higher conversion rate when compared to spleen-preserving DP. Eighth, the use of pancreatojejunostomy was the prevalent reconstruction in PD. Ninth, final histology was similar for MIPR performed at high- and low-volume centers, but neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used more frequently at high-volume centers.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital defect in which the AV has two leaflets rather than three, with BAV patients developing CAVD decades years earlier than in the general population. Current treatment for CAVD remains surgical replacement with its continued durability problems, as there are no pharmaceutical therapies or other alternative treatments available. Before such therapeutic approaches can be developed, a deeper understanding of CAVD disease mechanisms is clearly required. It is known that AV interstitial cells (AVICs) maintain the AV extracellular matrix and are typically quiescent in the normal state, transitioning into an activated, myofibroblast-like state during periods of growth or disease. One proposed mechanism of CAVD is the subsequent transition of AVICs into an osteoblast-like phenotype. A sensitive indicator of AVIC phenotypic state is enhanced basal contractility (tonus), so that AVICs from diseased AV will exhibit a higher basal tonus level. The goals of the present study were thus to assess the hypothesis that different human CAVD states lead to different biophysical AVIC states. To accomplish this, we characterized AVIC basal tonus behaviors from diseased human AV tissues embedded in 3D hydrogels. Established methods were utilized to track AVIC-induced gel displacements and shape changes after the application of Cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor) to depolymerize the AVIC stress fibers. Results indicated that human diseased AVICs from the non-calcified region of TAVs were significantly more activated than AVICs from the corresponding calcified region. In addition, AVICs from the raphe region of BAVs were more activated than from the non-raphe region. Interestingly, we observed significantly greater basal tonus levels in females compared to males. Furthermore, the overall AVIC shape changes after Cytochalasin suggested that AVICs from TAVs and BAVs develop different stress fiber architectures. These findings are the first evidence of sex-specific differences in basal tonus state in human AVICs in varying disease states. Future studies are underway to quantify stress fiber mechanical behaviors to further elucidate CAVD disease mechanisms.", "Keywords": ["aortic valve", "aortic valve interstitial cells", "basal tonus", "bicuspid aortic valve", "calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD)", "contractility", "stress fibers"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Tuscher", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, James T.

This study demonstrates the in vitro proof of concept of a biostable polymeric trileaflet valved conduit designed for surgical implantation and subsequent expansion via transcatheter balloon dilation to accommodate the growth of pediatric patients and delay or avoid repeated open-heart surgeries. The valved conduit is formed via dip molding using a polydimethylsiloxane-based polyurethane, a biocompatible material shown here to be capable of permanent stretching under mechanical loading. The valve leaflets are designed with an increased coaptation area to preserve valve competence at expanded diameters. Four 22\u00a0mm diameter valved conduits are tested in vitro for hydrodynamics, balloon dilated to new permanent diameters of 23.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0mm, and then tested again. Upon further dilation, two valved conduits sustain leaflet tears, while the two surviving devices reach final diameters of 24.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0mm. After each successful dilation, the valved conduits show increased effective orifice areas and decreased transvalvular pressure differentials while maintaining low regurgitation. These results demonstrate concept feasibility and motivate further development of a polymeric balloon-expandable device to replace valves in children and avoid reoperations.", "Keywords": ["congenital heart disease", "growth accommodation", "polymeric valves", "right ventricular outflow tract", "valved conduit"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Heart Valve Diseases", "Biocompatible Materials", "Catheters", "Prosthesis Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, New-York Presbyterian -

In particular, we prove that monotones displaying lower semicontinuity and strong superadditivity can be used to bound asymptotic transformation rates in these settings. This removes the need for asymptotic continuity, which cannot be defined in the traditional sense for infinite-dimensional systems. We consider three applications, to the resource theories of (I)\u00a0optical nonclassicality, (II)\u00a0entanglement, and (III)\u00a0quantum thermodynamics. In cases\u00a0(II) and\u00a0(III), the employed monotones are the (infinite-dimensional) squashed entanglement and the free energy, respectively. For case\u00a0(I), we consider the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality and prove it to be lower semicontinuous and strongly superadditive. One of our main technical contributions, and a key tool to establish these results, is a handy variational expression for the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality. Our technique then yields computable upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates, including those achievable under linear optical elements. We also prove a number of results which guarantee that the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality is bounded on any physically meaningful state and easily computable for some classes of states of interest, e.g., Fock diagonal states. We conclude by applying our findings to the problem of cat state manipulation and noisy Fock state purification.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia Galileo Galilei, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Padova, Via Marzolo 8, 35131 Padua, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Ludovico", "Last Name": "Lami", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und IQST, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89069 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Theurer", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und IQST, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89069 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martin B", "Last Name": "Plenio", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und IQST, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89069 Ulm, Germany."}], "Journal": "Communications in mathematical physics", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "36750544", "Title": "Sarcopenia and Patient's Body Composition: New Morphometric Tools to Predict Clinical Outcome After Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy: a Multicenter Study.", "Abstract": "The impact of preoperative body composition as independent predictor of prognosis for esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy is still unclear.

Here, we show that a decrease in the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) accelerates MV remodeling and progression to MR. Through studies of a population of patients with MR, we show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and SERT promoter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR LL genotype were associated with MV surgery at younger age. Functional characterization of 122 human MV samples, in conjunction with in vivo studies in SERT-/- mice and wild-type mice treated with the SSRI fluoxetine, showed that diminished SERT activity in MV interstitial cells (MVICs) contributed to the pathophysiology of MR through enhanced serotonin receptor (HTR) signaling. SERT activity was decreased in LL MVICs partially because of diminished membrane localization of SERT. In mice, fluoxetine treatment or SERT knockdown resulted in thickened MV leaflets. Similarly, silencing of SERT in normal human MVICs led to up-regulation of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) and collagen (COL1A1) in the presence of serotonin. In addition, treatment of MVICs with fluoxetine not only directly inhibited SERT activity but also decreased SERT expression and increased HTR2B expression. Fluoxetine treatment and LL genotype were also associated with increased COL1A1 expression in the presence of serotonin in MVICs, and these effects were attenuated by HTR2B inhibition. These results suggest that assessment of both 5-HTTLPR genotype and SERT-inhibiting treatments may be useful tools to risk-stratify patients with MV disease to estimate the likelihood of rapid disease progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Mitral Valve", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Fluoxetine", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Serotonin", "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Estibaliz", "Last Name": "Castillero", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emmett", "Last Name": "Fitzpatrick", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel J", "Last Name": "Keeney", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex M", "Last Name": "D'Angelo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin B", "Last Name": "Pressly", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mangesh", "Last Name": "Kurade", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Clinton", "Last Name": "Erwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivian", "Last Name": "Moreno", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Camillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Halley J", "Last Name": "Shukla", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vaishali V", "Last Name": "Inamdar", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arbi", "Last Name": "Aghali", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan B", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "Valley Hospital Heart Institute, Ridgewood, NJ 07450, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Salvati", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Itzhak", "Last Name": "Nissim", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics and Metabolic Disease, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lubica", "Last Name": "Rauova", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Oyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley J", "Last Name": "Stachelek", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chase", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania, Smilow Center for Translational Research, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abba M", "Last Name": "Krieger", "Affiliation": "Statistics Department, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Heart Valve Center and the Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2023Jan04"}, {"PMID": "36574676", "Title": "Bioprosthetic heart valve structural degeneration associated with metabolic syndrome: Mitigation with polyoxazoline modification.", "Abstract": "Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are widely used for surgical and transcatheter valve interventions but suffer from limited durability due to structural valve degeneration (SVD).

The aim of our study is to give a snapshot of current surgical propensity of expert Italian upper gastrointestinal surgeons in performing minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of gastric cancer in order to answer to the question if clinical practice overcome the recommendation.

Percentage of surgeons choosing a minimally invasive approach to treat early and advanced gastric cancer was similar. Additionally analyzing data from the centers involved, we obtained that the percentage of minimally invasive total and partial gastrectomies in advanced cases augmented with the increase of surgical procedures performed per year (p\u2009=\u20090.02 and p\u2009=\u20090.04 respectively).

Materials and Methods: We prospectively followed all patients with symptomatic BPH who underwent Rezum therapy at eight institutions and analyzed the functional results. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who matched the 5-year RCT inclusion criteria (Group A) and patients who did not (Group B). The pre- and postoperative data, complications, presence of antegrade ejaculation, and urinary and sexual outcomes were periodically recorded. Results: A total of 426 patients were eligible for the study (232 in Group A and 194 in Group B). Patients in Group B had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score, prostate volume, and postvoid residual measurement. No difference was found in terms of preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function, maximum urinary flow, and prostate-specific antigen.

In vitro, each of these agents significantly inhibited AGE-serum protein infiltration in BP. However, in 28-day rat subdermal BP implants only orally administered PYR demonstrated significant inhibition of AGE and serum protein uptake. Furthermore, BP PYR preincubation of BP mitigated AGE-serum protein SVD mechanisms in vitro, and demonstrated mitigation of both AGE-serum protein uptake and reduced calcification in vivo in 28-day rat subdermal BP explants. Inhibition of BP calcification as well as inhibition of AGE-serum protein infiltration was observed in 28-day rat subdermal BP explants pretreated with ethanol followed by PYR preincubation.

With the development of genome sequencing technologies, new opportunities are opening up for more accurate identification of areas associated with these traits. This article aims to develop a novel approach to the lifetime evaluation of cattle by 3-D visualization of economic-biological and genetic features. The purpose of this study was to identify significant variants underlying differences in the qualitative characteristics of meat, using imputed data on the sequence of the entire genome. Samples of biomaterial of young Aberdeen-Angus breed cattle (n = 96) were the material for carrying out genome-wide SNP genotyping. Genotyping was performed using a high-density DNA chip Bovine GPU HD BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), containing ~150 thousand SNPs.

"Biomethane plays a key role in achieving decarbonization and sustainable development goals. According to the objectives that arise, choosing the most suitable production system allows optimization of production, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. In this study, three biomethane production scenario life cycle assessments were compared to determine which would maintain the lowest CO2 emissions. Conventional anaerobic digestion and an innovative process called two-stage high pressure anaerobic digestion were considered. These methods were combined with two upgrading processes: water scrubbing and biological upgrading. Cattle manure and sugar beets were used as substrates for the process. Emissions were 805.6 gCO2eq/m3CH4 for the traditional biogas production process combined with water scrubbing and 450.3 gCO2eq/m3CH4 for the two-stage anaerobic digestion process combined with biological upgrading. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that these values would be reduced by 29.5\u00a0% and 48.0\u00a0% if electrical energy were produced using only renewable energy sources.", "Keywords": ["Biological upgrading", "Biomethane", "Life cycle assessment", "Two-stage anaerobic digestion", "Water scrubbing"], "MeSH terms": ["Anaerobiosis", "Animals", "Biofuels", "Carbon Dioxide", "Cattle", "Methane", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, University of Padova, 35020, Legnaro, PD, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Holl", "Affiliation": "State Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Bioenergy, University of Hohenheim, Garbenstra\u00dfe 9, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}, {"First Name": "J\u00f6rg", "Last Name": "Steinbrenner", "Affiliation": "State Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Bioenergy, University of Hohenheim, Garbenstra\u00dfe 9, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Pezzuolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, University of Padova, 35020, Legnaro, PD, Italy.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of MRI based restaging after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in predicting pathologic response. This multicenter cohort study included adult patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by curative intent elective surgery between January 2014 and December 2019 at four academic high-volume institutions. Magnetic resonance tumor regression grade (mrTRG) and pathologic tumor regression grade (pTRG) were reviewed and compared for all the patients. The agreement between radiologist and pathologist was assessed with the weighted k test. Risk factors for poor agreement were investigated using logistic regression. A total of 309 patients were included. Modest agreement was found between mrTRG and pTRG when regression was classified according to standard five-tier systems (k\u00a0=\u00a00.386). When only two categories were considered for each regression system, (pTRG 0-3 vs pTRG 4; mrTRG 2-5 vs mrTRG 1) an accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.83) was found between radiologic and pathologic assessment with a k value of 0.185.

Structural valve degeneration (SVD) of BHV due to both calcification and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) with associated serum proteins limits durability. We hypothesized that BP modified with poly-2-methyl-2-oxazoline (POZ) to inhibit protein entry would demonstrate reduced accumulation of AGE and serum proteins, mitigating SVD. In vitro studies of POZ-modified BP demonstrated reduced accumulation of serum albumin and AGE. BP-POZ in\u00a0vitro maintained collagen microarchitecture per two-photon microscopy despite AGE incubation, and in cell culture studies was associated with no change in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 after exposure to AGE and activated macrophages. Comparing POZ and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified BP in\u00a0vitro, BP-POZ was minimally affected by oxidative conditions, whereas BP-PEG was susceptible to oxidative deterioration. In juvenile rat subdermal implants, BP-POZ demonstrated reduced AGE formation and serum albumin infiltration, while calcification was not inhibited. However, BP-POZ rat subdermal implants with ethanol pretreatment demonstrated inhibition of both AGE accumulation and calcification. Ex vivo laminar flow studies with human blood demonstrated BP-POZ enhanced thromboresistance with reduced white blood cell accumulation.

The aim of the study is to compare recurrence and survival after Laparoscopic vs. Open Radical Nephroureterectomy (RNU) for Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Cancer (UTUC). Method: A retrospective evaluation of UTUC consecutive surgeries from 2008 to 2019 was conducted, including pT \u2265 2, High Grade UTUC who underwent RNU with bladder cuff excision without concomitant lymphadenectomy in three urological tertiary centers. Statistical analyses compared recurrence and cancer specific survival, based on surgical approach, while logistic multivariate analyses and Kaplan Meyer survival curve analyzed possible risk factors for recurrence and survival. Results: One hundred seven cases of RNU, 47 (43.9%) laparoscopic and 60 (56.1%) open, were included in this report. Preoperative characteristics were comparable between groups. However, tumor stage was higher in the Open arm [T3-T4 in 44 (73.3%) vs. 20 (43.4%) in Laparoscopic]. Mean follow-up was 91.6 months in laparoscopy RNU vs. 93.5 months in open RNU. Recurrence rate (RR) was comparable between groups (p = 0.594), and so was the site, although 3 (6.3%) peritoneal recurrences were found only in laparoscopic group (p = 0.057). At multivariate logistic regression, tumor stage and surgical approach were independent predictors of recurrence (p < 0.05), while only tumor stage was predictor of cancer specific death (p = 0.029). Conclusion: Surgical approach has no impact on recurrence site, overall survival, and RR. Still, according to our data peritoneal carcinomatosis was present only in laparoscopic arm, despite how it didn't reach statistical significance.", "Keywords": ["UTUC", "laparoscopy", "nephroureretectomy", "recurrence rate (RR)", "seeding"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Morselli", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Ferdinando Daniele", "Last Name": "Vitelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Cure Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giorgio", "Last Name": "Verrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, AUSL Modena, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Arcangelo", "Last Name": "Sebastianelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Campi", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Liaci", "Affiliation": "Unit of Urological Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery and Renal Transplantation, Careggi Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Spatafora", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Barzaghi", "Affiliation": "Unit of Urological Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery and Renal Transplantation, Careggi Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Cure Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "Gacci", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Serni", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Maurizio", "Last Name": "Brausi", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Cure Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34944982", "Title": "Blood Bacterial DNA Load and Profiling Differ in Colorectal Cancer Patients Compared to Tumor-Free Controls.", "Abstract": "Inflammation and immunity are linked to intestinal adenoma (IA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) development.

We performed 16S rRNA gene analysis of blood and applied conditional logistic regression. Further analyses were based on negative binomial distribution normalization and Random Forest algorithm. We found an overrepresentation of blood 16S rRNA gene copies in colon cancer as compared to tumor-free controls. For high levels of gene copies, community diversity was higher in colon cancer cases than controls. Bacterial taxa and operational taxonomic unit abundances were different between groups and were able to predict CRC with an accuracy of 0.70. Our data support the hypothesis of a higher passage of bacteria from gastrointestinal tract to bloodstream in colon cancer.

Aim of this study is to evaluate how COVID-19 influenced the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of surgical pancreatic diseases. A comparative analysis of surgical volumes and clinical, surgical and perioperative outcomes in ten Italian referral centers was conducted between the first semester 2020 and 2019. One thousand four hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the analysis: 638 from 2020 and 785 from 2019. Surgical volume in 2020 decreased by 18.7% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Benign/precursors diseases (-\u200943.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and neuroendocrine tumors (-\u200933.6%; p\u2009=\u20090.008) were the less treated diseases. No difference was reported in terms of discussed cases at the multidisciplinary tumor board (p\u2009=\u20090.43), mean time between diagnosis and neoadjuvant treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.91), indication to surgery and surgical resection (p\u2009=\u20090.35). Laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures dropped by 45.4% and 61.9%, respectively, during the lockdown weeks of 2020. No difference was documented for post-operative intensive care unit accesses (p\u2009=\u20090.23) and post-operative mortality (p\u2009=\u20090.06).

The concordance of MRI staging with final pathologic exam, albeit improved, has not yet reached perfection. The aim of this study is to analyze the agreement between MRI and pathologic exam in patients operated on for mid-low rectal cancer. Material and Method: Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) or upfront surgery were analyzed. Between January 2019 to December 2019, 140 patients enrolled in the AIMS Academy rectal cancer registry were analyzed. Sixty-two patients received nCRT and 78 underwent upfront surgery. Results: Overall, the agreement between MRI and pathologic exam on T stage and N stage were 64.7% and 69.2%, respectively. The agreement between MRI and pathologic exam on T stage was 62.7% for patients who did not receive nCRT and 67.4% for patients who received nCRT (p = 0.62). The agreement on N stage was 76.3% for patients who did not receive nCRT and 60.0% for patients who received nCRT (p = 0.075).

Bronchoscopy is a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure with a potential for direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure and hospital-acquired infection. Current guidelines about personal protective equipment and environment considerations represent key competencies to minimize droplets dispersion and reduce the risk of transmission. Different measures should be put in field based on setting, patient's clinical characteristics, urgency and indications of bronchoscopy. The use of this technique in SARS-CoV-2 patients is reported primarily for removal of airway plugs and for obtaining microbiological culture samples. In mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2, bronchoscopy is commonly used to manage complications such as hemoptysis, atelectasis or lung collapse when prone positioning, physiotherapy or recruitment maneuvers have failed. Further indications are represented by assistance during percutaneous tracheostomy. Continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive ventilation support and high flow nasal cannula oxygen are frequently used in patient affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): management of patients' airways and ventilation strategies differs from bronchoscopy indications, patient's clinical status and in course or required ventilatory support. Sedation is usually administered by the pulmonologist (performing the bronchoscopy) or by the anesthetist depending on the complexity of the procedure and the level of sedation required. Lastly, elective bronchoscopy for diagnostic indications during COVID-19 pandemic should be carried on respecting rigid standards which allow to minimize potential viral transmission, independently from patient's COVID-19 status.

of hepatic vascular anomalies may add challenges to an already difficult surgery such as pancreatoduodenectomy, particularly when performed laparoscopically. Thus, our aim was to assess the impact of an aberrant right hepatic artery (aRHA) on postoperative outcomes during laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) . Data of patients who underwent LPD were prospectively gathered and retrospectively analyzed. Patients with types III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX anomalies according to Michels' classification were included in the aRHA group and were compared with the remaining patients (nRHA group). 72 patients underwent LPD; 14 of these had an aRHA (19.4%). Except for BMI (p\u2009=\u20090.021), the two groups did not differ in terms of clinico-pathological characteristics. The two groups had similar postoperative complications (p\u2009=\u20090.123), pancreatic fistula (p\u2009=\u20090.790), biliary leakage (p\u2009=\u20090.209), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (p\u2009=\u20090.790), reoperations (p\u2009=\u20090.416), and mortality (p\u2009=\u20090.312). The median number of lymph nodes harvested was higher in aRHA group (p\u2009=\u20090.032), while R0 resection rate was similar between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.635). At the multivariate analysis, only moderate/high FRS (OR 3.95, p\u2009=\u20090.039) was an independent predictor of postoperative complications.

Seventy-three patients were included. Among these, 75.3% completed the EP, with a median number of items accomplished per patient of 21. Items with critical adherence were restrictive intraoperative fluid infusion (37%), avoidance of abdominal drain (14%), first clear liquid intake (67%), first solid food intake (48%).

However, very little is known about how progerin affects SMC contractility. Here, we studied the LaminAG609G/G609G mouse model of HGPS and found reduced arterial contractility at an early age that correlates with a decrease in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) mRNA and protein expression. Traction force microscopy on isolated SMCs from these mice revealed reduced force generation compared to wild-type controls; this effect was phenocopied by depletion of SM-MHC in WT SMCs and overcome by ectopic expression of SM-MHC in HGPS SMCs.

However, many of such approaches were hitherto limited to the finite-dimensional setting or were not connected with operational tasks. We overcome this by introducing a general method of quantifying resources for continuous-variable quantum systems based on the robustness measure, applicable to a plethora of physically relevant resources such as optical nonclassicality, entanglement, genuine non-Gaussianity, and coherence. We demonstrate in particular that the measure has a direct operational interpretation as the advantage enabled by a given state in a class of channel discrimination tasks. We show that the robustness constitutes a well-behaved, bona fide resource quantifier in any convex resource theory, contrary to a related negativity-based measure known as the standard robustness. Furthermore, we show the robustness to be directly observable-it can be computed as the expectation value of a single witness operator-and establish general methods for evaluating the measure. Explicitly applying our results to the relevant resources, we demonstrate the exact computability of the robustness for several classes of states.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bartosz", "Last Name": "Regula", "Affiliation": "School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 637371, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Ludovico", "Last Name": "Lami", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und IQST, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89069 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und IQST, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89069 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ryuji", "Last Name": "Takagi", "Affiliation": "School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 637371, Singapore."}], "Journal": "Physical review letters", "PubDate": "2021Mar19"}, {"PMID": "33785403", "Title": "Environmental Safety of the 180-W GreenLight Laser: A Pilot Study On Plume And Irrigating Fluids.", "Abstract": "To analyze the chemical composition of the surgical smoke and the outflow irrigation fluid produced during a common endourological surgical procedure to treat benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Air Pollution, Indoor", "Humans", "Lasers", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Prostatectomy", "Prostatic Hyperplasia", "Smoke", "Therapeutic Irrigation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Hesperia Hospital, CURE Group, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Anna Maria", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Campobasso", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ospedale Civile di Guastalla ed Ospedale Ercole Franchini di Montecchio Emilia, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Modenese", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Enrique", "Last Name": "Rijo", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Hospital Quiron Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Misrai", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Pasteur Clinic, Toulouse, France."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Rosa", "Affiliation": "Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Cindolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Hesperia Hospital, CURE Group, Modena, Italy."}], "Journal": "Urology", "PubDate": "2021Aug"}, {"PMID": "33781028", "Title": "Rezum procedure with Exime\u00ae stent: a step forward to micro-invasiveness.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Prostatic Hyperplasia", "Stents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Cindolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Casa di Cura Villa Stuart, Rome, Italy - lucacindolo@virgilio.it."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Rabito", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giampaolo", "Last Name": "Siena", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Spatafora", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy."}], "Journal": "Minerva urology and nephrology", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33781016", "Title": "Green light laser enucleation of the prostate with early apical release is safe and effective: single center experience and revision of the literature.", "Abstract": "Green Light laser enucleation of the prostate (GreenLEP) is an endoscopic treatment to treat bladder outlet obstruction in men with large prostate (>100 cc).

Reasons reported for not initiating or completing AC include onset of postoperative complications, drug toxicity, disease progression and/or patient preferences. Little is known regarding the impact of obesity on the compliance to AC in this setting. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective study analyzed compliance to AC and treatment-related morbidity in 511 patients having undergone surgery with curative intent for rectal cancer in six Italian colorectal centers between January 2013 and December 2017. Results: 70 patients were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2). The proportion of open procedures (22.9% vs. 13.4%) and conversions (14.3% vs. 4.8%) was greater in obese compared to non-obese patients (p 0.001). Median hospital stay was one day longer for obese patients (9 days vs. 10 days, p=0.038) while there was no statistically significant difference in the complication rate, whether overall (58.6% in obese vs. 52.3% in non-obese) or with a Clavien-Dindo score 3 (17.1% vs 10.9%). AC was offered to 49/70 (70%) patients in the obese group and 306/441 (69.4%) in the non-obese group (p=0.43). There was no statistically significant difference in AC compliance: 18.4% and 22.9% did not start AC, while 36.7% and 34.6%, started AC but did not complete the scheduled treatment (p=0.79) in the obese and non-obese group, respectively. Overall, 55% of patients who started AC successfully completed their adjuvant treatment. Conclusions: Obesity did not impact compliance to AC for locally advanced rectal cancer: compliance was poor in obese and non-obese patients with no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

BHV fail due to structural valve degeneration (SVD), often with calcification. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are post-translational, non-enzymatic reaction products from sugars reducing proteins. AGE are present in SVD-BHV clinical explants and are not detectable in un-implanted BHV. Prior studies modeled BP-AGE formation in vitro with glyoxal, a glucose breakdown product, and serum albumin. However, glucose is the most abundant AGE precursor. Thus, the present studies investigated the hypothesis that BHV susceptibility to glucose related AGE, together with serum proteins, results in deterioration of collagen structure and mechanical properties. In vitro experiments studied AGE formation in BP and porcine collagen sponges (CS) comparing\u00a014C-glucose and\u00a014C-glyoxal with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA). Glucose incorporation occurred at a significantly lower level than glyoxal (p<0.02). BSA co-incubations demonstrated reduced glyoxal and glucose uptake by both BP and CS. BSA incubation caused a significant increase in BP mass, enhanced by glyoxal co-incubation. Two-photon microscopy of BP showed BSA induced disruption of collagen structure that was more severe with glucose or glyoxal co-incubation. Uniaxial testing of CS demonstrated that glucose or glyoxal together with BSA compared to controls, caused accelerated deterioration of viscoelastic relaxation, and increased stiffness over a 28-day time course. In conclusion, glucose, glyoxal and BSA uniquely contribute to AGE-mediated disruption of heterograft collagen structure and deterioration of mechanical properties.", "Keywords": ["Biomechanics", "Collagen structure", "Glucose", "Glyoxal", "Structural valve degeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cattle", "Collagen", "Glucose", "Glycation End Products, Advanced", "Glyoxal", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Heterografts", "Serum Albumin", "Serum Albumin, Bovine", "Swine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Rock", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Keeney", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrey", "Last Name": "Zakharchenko", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hajime", "Last Name": "Takano", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Spiegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States."}, {"First Name": "Abba M", "Last Name": "Krieger", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Departments of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States.

A web-based questionnaire (26 items) was sent to 12 SISME units. Short-term outcomes of esophageal resections performed during the lockdown were compared with those achieved in the same period of 2019. Six (50%) centers had significant restrictions in their activity. However, overall number of resections did not decrease compared to 2019, while a higher rate of open esophageal resections was observed (40 vs. 21.7%; P\u2009=\u20090.034). Surgery was delayed in 24 (36.9%) patients in 6 (50%) centers, mostly due to shortage of anesthesiologists, and occupation of intensive care unit beds from intubated COVID-19 patients. Indications for neoadjuvant chemo (radio) therapy were extended in 14% of patients. Separate COVID-19 hospital pathways were active in 11 (91.7%) units. COVID-19 screening protocols included nasopharyngeal swab in 91.7%, chest computed tomography scan in 8.3% and selective use of lung ultrasound in 75% of units. Postoperative interstitial pneumonia occurred in 1 (1.5%) patient. Recovery from COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by screening of patients in all units, and follow-up outpatient visits in only 33% of units.

terephthalate; PET). In this study, the dynamic response of these synthetic arterial substitutes to physiological pulsatile conditions is investigated in depth. Experiments were performed on a mock circulatory loop developed to replicate physiological pulsatile pressure and flow. Two different models of Dacron grafts (branched and straight) were tested at various heart rate conditions. Results are presented in terms of cyclic axisymmetric diameter changes, hysteretic loops of the pressure-diameter change, and viscoelastic parameters, such as loss factor and storage modulus that are identified from the hysteresis loop. The amplitude of cyclic diameter change of the Dacron graft was found to be always below 0.2% for all the heart rates considered (from 57 to 187 bpm). The loss factor of the Dacron graft slightly increased with the heart rate; almost no effect of the pulse rate was observed on the storage modulus, which was identified to be around 100\u00a0MPa. Both glycerol-water mixture (i.e. the blood analogue fluid) and saline solution were used in the circulatory loop and results did not present significant differences between the two cases. This shows that the effect of the shear load on the dynamic response of Dacron grafts is negligible.

A Multi-Center Comparative Study and Cost Analysis.", "Abstract": "Background: The Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Italy has slowed down the clinical surgical activity. A system of hub and spoke hospitals was set up to take care of oncological patients with the consequent almost complete abolition of the elective surgical activity for non-oncological pathologies. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the surgical volumes of 4 different non academic general hospitals in Lombardy belonging to 4 different provinces. The quarter March April May 2019 was compared with the same period of 2020. All different procedures were listed. The cost analysis was performed using the DRG system. Results: In the four hospitals involved the surgical procedures reduced from 1903 to 350 with a drop of the 81.6%. Procedures for cancer from 403 to 161 with a drop of 60.1%. Procedures for benign disease from 1310 to 118 with a drop of the 91%. Emergencies from 190 to 71 with a drop of the 62.6%. State refund for the procedures performed from 6.708.023 to 1.678.154 with a drop of 75%. Conclusions: Elective surgery was dramatically impaired by the Covid-19 pandemic. Above all procedures for non oncological and non urgent patients were particularly affected. In view of a possible second wave of the pandemic, the surgical planning must select patients not only on onco logical criteria but rather on clinical ones. An ad hoc hub and spoke hospitals pathway has to be implemented for benign surgical diseases by whoever is facing the Covid pandemic at its spike.", "Keywords": ["Covid19pandemic", "costanalysis", "surgery"], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "General Surgery", "Humans", "Italy", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Retrospective Studies", "SARS-CoV-2", "Surgical Procedures, Operative", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giulio", "Last Name": "Mari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosario", "Last Name": "Giordano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Uccelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Cesana", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Olmi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giovanni Carlo", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Origi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dario", "Last Name": "Maggioni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gaia", "Last Name": "Colletti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Costanzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "On behalf of AIMS Academy Clinical Research Network", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)", "PubDate": "2020Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "32875167", "Title": "Glycation and Serum Albumin Infiltration Contribute to the Structural Degeneration of Bioprosthetic Heart Valves.", "Abstract": "Valvular heart diseases are associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and often require surgical and/or percutaneous repair or replacement.

We hereby present our experience of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy focused on technical notes. Technical description: A 5 trocars technique is used. Vision is provided by a 30 degree scope with 4K technology for the demolitive phase and 3D for the reconstructive phase. The right colic flexure is mobilized and an extensive Kocher maneuver is carried out exposing the inferior vena cava and left renal vein. The gastric antrum is resected with a mechanical stapler. The common hepatic artery is identified behind the superior pancreatic margin; lymphadenectomy of stations 7, 8, 9, 12 a and b is performed, until the gastroduodenal artery is cleared from the lymphatic tissue; a bull-dog clamp is placed to interrupt the arterial flow through the gastroduodenal artery, in order to exclude aberrant vascularization of the liver from the SMA. The common hepatic duct is transected just above the cystic duct. The pancreas is sectioned with monopolar energy, dividing the main pancreatic duct 2-3 mm distal to the parenchymal transection line with cold scissors, as to leave a stump that will facilitate the duct-to-mucosa anastomosis then the first jejunal loop is sectioned. A complete dissection of the mesopancreas is performed, moving from a caudal to cephalad fashion. Prior to perform the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis, a fistula risk score based on pancreatic parenchymal texture, tumor type, Wirsung diameter, intraoperative blood loss is assessed. The pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis is carried out using prolene and pds sutures. The end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy is performed about 10 cm distant from the pancreaticojejunostomy. The side to- side gastrojejunostomy is performed using a 60 mm linear stapler. Conclusion: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is a demanding procedure affected by high morbidity rates.

There is a clinical need for a precise noninvasive method to detect iron for risk stratification of patients and therapy evaluation. Here, we report that magnetic susceptibility imaging in a large animal model shows an infarct paramagnetic shift associated with duration of coronary artery occlusion and the presence of iron. Iron validation techniques used include histology, immunohistochemistry, spectrometry and spectroscopy. Further mRNA analysis shows upregulation of ferritin and heme oxygenase. While conventional imaging corroborates the findings of iron deposition, magnetic susceptibility imaging has improved sensitivity to iron and mitigates confounding factors such as edema and fibrosis.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies suggesting that AI is an active disease process caused by a combination of factors including but not limited to alteration of specific molecular pathways, genetic predisposition, and changes in the mechanotransductive properties of the AV apparatus. As the surgical management of AV disease continues to evolve, increasingly sophisticated surgical and percutaneous techniques for AV repair and replacement, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), have become more commonplace and will likely continue to expand as new devices are introduced. However, these techniques necessitate frequent reappraisal of the biological and mechanobiological mechanisms underlying AV regurgitation to better understand the risk factors for AI development and recurrence following surgical intervention as well as expand our limited knowledge on patient selection for such procedures. The aim of this review is to describe some of the putative mechanisms implicated in the development of AI, dissect some of the cross-talk among known and possible signaling pathways leading to valve remodeling, identify association between these pathways and pharmacological approaches, and discuss the implications for surgical and percutaneous approaches to AV repair in replacement in the TAVR era.", "Keywords": ["Cardiac and Cardiothoracic Surgery", "Clinical Cardiology", "Non-invasive and minimally invasive Cardiology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Filippo", "Last Name": "Ravalli", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, NY - USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander P", "Last Name": "Kossar", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, NY - USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroo", "Last Name": "Takayama", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, NY - USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan B", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Heart Institute - Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, NY - USA."}], "Journal": "Structural heart : the journal of the Heart Team", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32468424", "Title": "The Italian National Registry for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery: an initiative of the Italian Group of Minimally Invasive Pancreas Surgery (IGoMIPS).", "Abstract": "The value of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery (MIPS) is still uncertain, despite the growing number of publications, including reviews and meta-analyses, and the quick diffusion of these procedures worldwide.

During this meeting IGoMIPS members approved that the Italian Registry will provide data to the European Registry, while retaining the right to analyze and publish Italian data. An audience survey was also conducted to obtain information on perceived value and current implementation of MIPS in founding Institutions.

Accumulating evidence suggests that mitral valve (MV) leaflets actively remodel post MI, and this remodelling increases both the severity of IMR and the occurrence of MV repair failures. However, the mechanisms of extracellular matrix maintenance and modulation by MV interstitial cells (MVICs) and their impact on MV leaflet tissue integrity and repair failure remain largely unknown. Herein, we sought to elucidate the multiscale behaviour of IMR-induced MV remodelling using an established ovine model. Leaflet tissue at eight weeks post MI exhibited significant permanent plastic radial deformation, eliminating mechanical anisotropy, accompanied by altered leaflet composition. Interestingly, no changes in effective collagen fibre modulus were observed, with MVICs slightly rounder, at eight weeks post MI. RNA sequencing indicated that YAP-induced genes were elevated at four weeks post MI, indicating elevated mechanotransduction. Genes related to extracellular matrix organization were downregulated at four weeks post MI when IMR occurred. Transcriptomic changes returned to baseline by eight weeks post MI. This multiscale study suggests that IMR induces plastic deformation of the MV with no functional damage to the collagen fibres, providing crucial information for computational simulations of the MV in IMR.", "Keywords": ["RNA sequencing", "ischaemic mitral regurgitation", "mitral valve", "tissue remodelling", "valve interstitial cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Gene Expression", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mitral Valve", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Myocardial Infarction", "Sheep"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel P", "Last Name": "Howsmon", "Affiliation": "James T.

The pathophysiology of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is complex and incompletely understood, but key features include activation and transformation of mitral valve (MV) valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into an active phenotype leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and compromise of the structural components of the mitral valve leaflets. Uncovering the mechanisms behind these events offers the potential for therapies to prevent, delay, or reverse myxomatous mitral valve degeneration. One such mechanism involves the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT), which has been linked to development of valvulopathy in a variety of settings, including valvulopathy induced by serotonergic drugs, Serotonin-producing carcinoid tumors, and development of valvulopathy in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of serotonin. Similar to humans, the domestic dog also experiences naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve degeneration, and in some breeds of dogs, the lifetime prevalence of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration reaches 100%. In dogs, myxomatous mitral valve degeneration has been associated with high serum serotonin, increased expression of serotonin-receptors, autocrine production of serotonin within the mitral valve leaflets, and downregulation of serotonin clearance mechanisms. One pathway closely associated with serotonin involves transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and the two pathways share a common ability to activate mitral valve valvular interstitial cells in both humans and dogs. Understanding the role of serotonin and transforming growth factor beta in myxomatous mitral valve degeneration gives rise to potential therapies, such as 5HT receptor (5HT-R) antagonists. The main purposes of this review are to highlight the commonalities between myxomatous mitral valve degeneration in humans and dogs, with specific regards to serotonin and transforming growth factor beta, and to champion the dog as a relevant and particularly valuable model of human disease that can accelerate development of novel therapies.", "Keywords": ["Mitral valve disease", "Mitral valve repair", "Mitral valve replacement", "Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration", "Serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dog Diseases", "Dogs", "Humans", "Mitral Valve", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Mitral Valve Prolapse", "Serotonin", "Signal Transduction", "Species Specificity", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Oyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chad", "Last Name": "Elliott", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia Cardiovascular Institute and College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kerry A", "Last Name": "Loughran", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander P", "Last Name": "Kossar", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia Cardiovascular Institute and College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estibaliz", "Last Name": "Castillero", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia Cardiovascular Institute and College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia Cardiovascular Institute and College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We hypothesized that inhibition of activin type II receptors (ACTRII) to reduce MSTN signaling would reduce pathological cardiac remodeling in experimental heart failure (HF). C57BL/6J mice underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation under anesthesia to induce myocardial infarction (MI) or no ligation (sham). MI and sham animals were each randomly divided into groups (n \u2265 10 mice/group) receiving an ACTRII or ACTRII/TGF\u03b2 receptor-signaling inhibiting strategy: 1) myo-Fc group (weekly 10 mg/kg Myo-Fc) or 2) Fol + TGFi group (daily 12 \u00b5g/kg follistatin plus 2 mg/kg TGF\u03b2 receptor inhibitor), versus controls. ACTRII/TGFBR signaling inhibition preserved cardiac function by echocardiography and prevented an increase in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). ACTRII/TGFBR inhibition resulted in increased phosphorylation (P) of Akt and decreased P-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in MI mice. In vitro, Akt contributed to P-SMAD2,3, P-p38, and BNP regulation in cardiomyocytes. ACTRII/TGFBR inhibition increased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) levels and decreased unfolded protein response (UPR) markers in MI mice. ACTRII/TGFBR inhibition was associated with a decrease in cardiac fibrosis and fibrosis markers, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), type I collagen, fibronectin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 in MI mice. MSTN exerted a direct regulation on the UPR marker eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2\u03b1 (eIf2\u03b1) in cardiomyocytes. Our study suggests that ACTRII ligand inhibition has beneficial effects on cardiac signaling and fibrosis after ischemic HF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Activin type II receptor ligand inhibition resulted in preserved cardiac function, a decrease in cardiac fibrosis, improved SERCA2a levels, and a prevention of the unfolded protein response in mice with myocardial infarction.", "Keywords": ["cardiac fibrosis", "cardiac remodeling", "heart failure", "myocardial infarction", "myostatin"], "MeSH terms": ["Activin Receptors, Type II", "Animals", "Echocardiography", "Fibrosis", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Myocardium", "Myostatin", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Phosphorylation", "Physical Endurance", "Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I", "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases", "Signal Transduction", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Estibaliz", "Last Name": "Castillero", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hirokazu", "Last Name": "Akashi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Najjar", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ruiping", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lea Maria", "Last Name": "Brandstetter", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xianghai", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xiaokan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Sperry", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marcia", "Last Name": "Gailes", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Karina", "Last Name": "Guaman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Recht", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Schlosberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "H Lee", "Last Name": "Sweeney", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Ziad A", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shunichi", "Last Name": "Homma", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paolo C", "Last Name": "Colombo", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Division of Surgical Science, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "P Christian", "Last Name": "Schulze", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Isaac", "Last Name": "George", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

The Advanced International Mini-Invasive Surgery (AIMS) academy clinical research network aims to create a rectal cancer registry. This will prospectively collect the data of patients operated on for non-metastatic rectal cancer in high volume colorectal surgical units through a well design pre-fashioned database for non-metastatic rectal cancer, in order to take all multidisciplinary aspects into consideration. Methods/Design: The protocol describes a multicenter prospective observational cohort study, investigating demographics, frailty, cancer-related features, surgical and radiological parameters, and oncological outcomes among patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer who are candidates for surgery with curative intent. Patients enrolled in the present registry will be followed up for 5 years after surgery. Discussion: Standardization and centralization of data collection for neoplastic diseases is a virtuous process for patient care.

Here, we review the various experimental methods that have been employed to probe this intricate microstructure and which attempt to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the leaflet's mechanical properties. These methods include uniaxial, biaxial, and flexural tests, coupled with microstructural characterization techniques such as small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), small angle light scattering (SALS), and polarized light microscopy. These experiments have revealed complex elastic and viscoelastic mechanisms that are highly directional and dependent upon loading conditions and biochemistry. Of all engineering materials, polymers and polymer-based composites are best able to mimic the tissue-level mechanical behavior of the native leaflet. This similarity to native tissue permits the fabrication of polymeric valves with physiological flow patterns, reducing the risk of thrombosis compared to mechanical valves and in some cases surpassing the in vivo durability of bioprosthetic valves. Earlier work on polymeric valves simply assumed the mechanical properties of the polymer material to be linear elastic, while more recent studies have considered the full hyperelastic stress-strain response. These material models have been incorporated into computational models for the optimization of valve geometry, with the goal of minimizing internal stresses and improving durability.

Healthy aortas from twelve beating heart donors with an average age of 49.4 years, were received from Transplant Qu\u00e9bec. Axial and circumferential strips were prepared from the specimens. They were dissected into intima, media and adventitia layers. Measurements of the opening angles were used to identify the circumferential residual stresses. Uniaxial tensile tests on axial and circumferential strips, together with the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel material model, were used to characterize the hyperelastic behaviour of the three aortic layers for each donor. Uniaxial harmonic excitations at different frequency, superimposed to initial stretch values, were used to characterize the viscoelastic behaviour. The storage modulus and the loss tangent were obtained for each layer in both directions; comparison to intact aortic wall was also performed. The generalized Maxwell model, within the framework of nonlinear viscoelasticity with internal variables, was used to obtain the constitutive material parameters. Results showed a positive correlation (p\u202f<\u202f0.05 for circumferential media and adventitia) between stiffness and donor age for the three layers of the aorta in both axial and circumferential directions. A significant increase (around 50%) of the storage modulus (i.e. dynamic stiffness) was observed between the quasi-static value and loading at 1\u202fHz frequency, while further increase in frequency marginally affected its value. The loss tangent was only slightly influenced by the stretch value, which justified the use of the viscoelastic model adopted. Finally, similar loss tangent values were found for the three aortic layers.", "Keywords": ["Experiments", "Human aorta", "Layer-specific hyperelasticity", "Modelling", "Residual stresses", "Viscoelasticity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Adventitia", "Aged", "Aorta, Thoracic", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Elasticity", "Female", "Heart", "Humans", "Male", "Materials Testing", "Middle Aged", "Pressure", "Stress, Mechanical", "Tensile Strength", "Viscosity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Amabili", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, McGill University, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, H3A 0C3, Canada; Department of Biomedical Engineering, McGill University, 817 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, H3A 0C3, Canada.

In vitro and ex\u00a0vivo experiments with antioxidant strategies and antagonists of osteogenic differentiation revealed that AVS c is reversible. In this study, we characterized the underlying changes in the extracellular matrix architecture and valve interstitial cell activation in AVSc and tested in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo the activity of a clinically approved SOD (superoxide dismutase) mimic and redox-active drug MnTnBu OE -2-PyP5+ ( BMX -001). Methods and Results After receiving informed consent, samples from patients with AVS c, AV stenosis, and controls were collected. Uniaxial mechanical stimulation and in\u00a0vitro studies on human valve interstitial cells were performed. An angiotensin II chronic infusion model was used to impose AV thickening and remodeling. We characterized extracellular matrix structures by small-angle light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, histology, and mass spectrometry. Diseased human valves showed altered collagen fiber alignment and ultrastructural changes in AVS c, accumulation of oxidized cross-linking products in AV stenosis, and reversible expression of extracellular matrix regulators ex\u00a0vivo. We demonstrated that MnTnBu OE -2-PyP5+ inhibits human valve interstitial cell activation and extracellular matrix remodeling in a murine model (C57 BL /6J) of AVS c by electron microscopy and histology. Conclusions AVS c is associated with architectural remodeling despite marginal effects on the mechanical properties in both human and mice. MnTnBu OE -2-PyP5+ controls AV thickening in a murine model of AVS c. Because this compound has been approved recently for clinical use, this work could shift the focus for the treatment of calcific AV disease, moving from AV stenosis to an earlier presentation ( AVS c) that could be more responsive to medical therapies.", "Keywords": ["aortic valve stenosis", "extracellular matrix", "reactive oxygen species", "valve", "valve interstitial cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Animals", "Aortic Valve", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Calcinosis", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Case-Control Studies", "Collagen", "Disease Models, Animal", "Extracellular Matrix", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Metalloporphyrins", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Middle Aged", "Sclerosis", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Vascular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wanda", "Last Name": "Anselmo", "Affiliation": "1 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuela", "Last Name": "Branchetti", "Affiliation": "1 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA."}, {"First Name": "Juan B", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "2 Ottawa Heart Institute Ottawa Ontario Canada."}, {"First Name": "Gen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "3 Columbia University New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Salma", "Last Name": "Ayoub", "Affiliation": "4 Texas University at Austin TX."}, {"First Name": "Eric K", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "1 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Rioux", "Affiliation": "5 The Valley Hospital Ridgewood NJ."}, {"First Name": "Artak", "Last Name": "Tovmasyan", "Affiliation": "6 Duke University School of Medicine Durham NC."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline H", "Last Name": "Fortier", "Affiliation": "2 Ottawa Heart Institute Ottawa Ontario Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Sacks", "Affiliation": "4 Texas University at Austin TX."}, {"First Name": "Ines", "Last Name": "Batinic-Haberle", "Affiliation": "6 Duke University School of Medicine Durham NC."}, {"First Name": "Stanley L", "Last Name": "Hazen", "Affiliation": "7 Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "8 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia PA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "3 Columbia University New York NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2018Oct16"}, {"PMID": "30141122", "Title": "Perioperative major acute cardiovascular events after 180-W GreenLight laser photoselective vaporization of the prostate.", "Abstract": "Major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) prevalence after 180-W GreenLight (180-W GL) laser photoselective vaporization (PVP) have never been explored.

For PCI, relatively small differences in clinical outcomes have been reported between bare metal and drug-eluting stents, and the latter seems to have inconsistent and somewhat unpredictable effects on the vascular biology of the coronary arteries.

It has been hypothesized that altered MV tissue stress states lead to deviations from cellular homeostasis, resulting in subsequent cellular activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. However, a quantitative link between alterations in the organ-level in vivo state and in vitro-based mechanobiology studies has yet to be made. We thus developed an integrated experimental-computational approach to elucidate MV tissue and interstitial cell responses to varying tissue strain levels. Comprehensive results at different length scales revealed that normal responses are observed only within a defined range of tissue deformations, whereas deformations outside of this range lead to hypo- and hyper-synthetic responses, evidenced by changes in \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen, and other ECM and cell adhesion molecule regulation. We identified MV interstitial cell deformation as a key player in leaflet tissue homeostatic regulation and, as such, used it as the metric that makes the critical link between in vitro responses to simulated equivalent in vivo behaviour. Results indicated that cell responses have a delimited range of in vivo deformations that maintain a homeostatic response, suggesting that deviations from this range may lead to deleterious tissue remodelling and failure.", "Keywords": ["collagen", "myofibroblast", "valve interstitial cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Survival", "Collagen", "Extracellular Matrix", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Homeostasis", "Mitral Valve", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Swine", "Tissue Culture Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Salma", "Last Name": "Ayoub", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Simulation, Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES), Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chung-Hao", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn H", "Last Name": "Driesbaugh", "Affiliation": "Gorman Cardiovascular Research Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanda", "Last Name": "Anselmo", "Affiliation": "Gorman Cardiovascular Research Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Connor T", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Simulation, Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES), Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Gorman Cardiovascular Research Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Gorman Cardiovascular Research Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Gorman Cardiovascular Research Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Sacks", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Simulation, Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES), Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA msacks@ices.utexas.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28863437", "Title": "Serotonin and catecholamines in the development and progression of heart valve diseases.", "Abstract": "Heart valve diseases (HVDs) arise from a number of different processes that affect both the structure and function of the valve apparatus. Despite diverse aetiologies, treatments for HVDs are limited to percutaneous or surgical interventions. The search for medical therapies to prevent or slow the progression of HVDs has been hampered by our poor understanding of the progression from subclinical to symptomatic phases, and our limited knowledge of the molecular signals that control the susceptibility of valve interstitial cells to pathological remodeling. Clinical evidence has suggested a link between certain neurotransmitters and valvular diseases of the heart. The fenfluramine-phentermine appetite suppressants popular in the 1980s were linked to mitral valve dysfunction, and ergot-derived dopamine agonists for Parkinson's disease have been associated with an increased risk of mitral and aortic valve regurgitation. The effect does not appear to be limited to medications, as valvular pathologies have also been observed in patients with carcinoid tumours of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells.

Long-term follow-up of population-based randomized trials has demonstrated that ultrasound (US) screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) measuring 3\u00a0cm or greater decreases AAA-related mortality rates and is cost-effective. We though to prospectively perform during a 26-month period a limited US examination of the infrarenal aorta in volunteers of both gender aged 60-85\u00a0years without history of AAA living in the area of Como, Italy. From September 2010 to November 2013 ComoCuore, a no-profit nongovernmental association, enrolled 1555 people (aged 68.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8\u00a0years; 48.6\u2009% males). Clinical data and a US imaging of the aorta were collected for each participant. AAA was found in 22 volunteers (1.4\u2009%) mainly males (2.5\u2009% in males vs. 0.4\u2009% in females p\u2009=\u20090.005). Overall, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was higher in patients with vs. without AAA (mean 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0 vs. 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Independent predictors of AAA on multivariate analysis were age (OR 1.14, 1.06-1.22; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), male gender (OR 8.23, 1.79-37.91; p\u2009=\u20090.007), and both current (OR 4.98, 1.57-15.79; p\u2009=\u20090.007) and previous smoking (OR 2.76, 1.12-8.94; p\u2009=\u20090.03). Our study confirms the feasibility of one time US screening for AAA in a large cohort of asymptomatic people. Independent predictors of AAA were male sex, older age and a history of smoking.

Here we use mouse modeling to show that matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12), a potent elastase, is essential for acute and chronic arterial stiffening. MMP12 was induced in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) after acute vascular injury. As determined by genome-wide analysis, the magnitude of its gene induction exceeded that of all other MMPs as well as those of the fibrillar collagens and lysyl oxidases, other common regulators of tissue stiffness. A preferential induction of SMC MMP12, without comparable effect on collagen abundance or structure, was also seen during chronic arterial stiffening with age. In both settings, deletion of MMP12 reduced elastin degradation and blocked arterial stiffening as assessed by atomic force microscopy and immunostaining for stiffness-regulated molecular markers. Isolated MMP12-null SMCs sense extracellular stiffness normally, indicating that MMP12 causes arterial stiffening by remodeling the SMC microenvironment rather than affecting the mechanoresponsiveness of the cells themselves. In human aortic samples, MMP12 levels strongly correlate with markers of SMC stiffness. We conclude that MMP12 causes arterial stiffening in mice and suggest that it functions similarly in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Aging", "Animals", "Chronic Disease",

The objectives of this randomized-controlled trial are to compare the short-term outcomes (bowel function, return to oral nutrition, day of discharge, fatigue, time to resume normal activities, functional capabilities, and readmission rate) of patients undergoing elective laparoscopic high anterior resection (HAR) following either a FT or a standard program. The prospective randomized-controlled trial included 52 consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic HAR. Group 1 was treated with a FT rehabilitation program, and group 2 was treated with a standard care (SC) program. Patients were interviewed 14 and 30 days postoperatively. One patient in each group was excluded from the study. Mean hospital stay, time of first bowel movement, and bowel function resumption were significantly shorter in the FT group (P<0.05). Patients in the FT group referred more pain in day 0 versus patients in the SC group (P<0.05) even though the difference disappeared from day 1. Fatigue was significantly reduced at day 14 in the FT group compared with the SC group (P<0.01). Similarly, ability to resume the normal preoperative attitude (walking stairs, cooking, housekeeping, shopping, and walking outdoors) was significantly better at day 14 in the FT group (P<0.005). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at day 30 for the same parameters. There were no readmissions in both the groups and no need for consultations from general practitioners. FT multimodal program is a safe approach effective on postoperative short-term outcome significantly reducing hospital stay. Early postoperative pain control needs to be optimized.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Colectomy", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain, Postoperative", "Prospective Studies", "Rectum", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giulio M", "Last Name": "Mari", "Affiliation": "Chirurgia Generale e Videolaparoscopica.

Latex-allergic patients undergoing diagnostic and operative medical procedures are at risk of potentially life-threatening reactions. Accurate diagnostic methods are therefore crucial.

In 14 patients with clinical symptoms and 27 controls, latex skin prick tests (SPT), IgE against latex (CAP) and serological component resolved specific latex-allergen determination (Hev b1, b3, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11) based on ImmunoCAP ISAC were performed.
