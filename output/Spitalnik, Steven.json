[{"PMID": "38929156", "Title": "The Role of Ergothioneine in Red Blood Cell Biology: A Review and Perspective.", "Abstract": "Oxidative stress can damage tissues and cells, and their resilience or susceptibility depends on the robustness of their antioxidant mechanisms. The latter include small molecules, proteins, and enzymes, which are linked together in metabolic pathways. Red blood cells are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to their large number of hemoglobin molecules, which can undergo auto-oxidation. This yields reactive oxygen species that participate in Fenton chemistry, ultimately damaging their membranes and cytosolic constituents. Fortunately, red blood cells contain robust antioxidant systems to enable them to circulate and perform their physiological functions, particularly delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Nonetheless, if red blood cells have insufficient antioxidant reserves (e.g., due to genetics, diet, disease, or toxin exposure), this can induce hemolysis in vivo or enhance susceptibility to a \"storage lesion\" in vitro, when blood donations are refrigerator-stored for transfusion purposes. Ergothioneine, a small molecule not synthesized by mammals, is obtained only through the diet. It is absorbed from the gut and enters cells using a highly specific transporter (i.e., SLC22A4). Certain cells and tissues, particularly red blood cells, contain high ergothioneine levels. Although no deficiency-related disease has been identified, evidence suggests ergothioneine may be a beneficial \"nutraceutical.\" Given the requirements of red blood cells to resist oxidative stress and their high ergothioneine content, this review discusses ergothioneine's potential importance in protecting these cells and identifies knowledge gaps regarding its relevance in enhancing red blood cell circulatory, storage, and transfusion quality.", "Keywords": ["RBC", "ROS", "antioxidant", "ergothioneine", "erythrocyte", "nutraceutical", "supplement"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany A", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph P", "Last Name": "Kao", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering, Department of Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver, CO 80203, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Jun13"}, {"PMID": "38915523", "Title": "Ferroptosis regulates hemolysis in stored murine and human red blood cells.", "Abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) metabolism regulates hemolysis during aging in vivo and in the blood bank.

To examine this concept, we performed metabolomics analyses of 643 blood units from volunteers who donated units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) on 2 separate occasions. These analyses identified carnitine metabolism as the most reproducible pathway across multiple donations from the same donor. We also measured l-carnitine and acyl-carnitines in 13\u2009091 packed RBC units from donors in the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation study. Genome-wide association studies against 879\u2009000 polymorphisms identified critical genetic factors contributing to interdonor heterogeneity in end-of-storage carnitine levels, including common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in genes encoding carnitine transporters (SLC22A16, SLC22A5, and SLC16A9); carnitine synthesis (FLVCR1 and MTDH) and metabolism (CPT1A, CPT2, CRAT, and ACSS2), and carnitine-dependent repair of lipids oxidized by ALOX5. Significant associations between genetic polymorphisms on SLC22 transporters and carnitine pools in stored RBCs were validated in 525 Diversity Outbred mice. Donors carrying 2 alleles of the rs12210538 SLC22A16 single-nucleotide polymorphism exhibited the lowest l-carnitine levels, significant elevations of in\u00a0vitro hemolysis, and the highest degree of vesiculation, accompanied by increases in lipid peroxidation markers. Separation of RBCs by age, via in\u00a0vivo biotinylation in mice, and Percoll density gradients of human RBCs, showed age-dependent depletions of l-carnitine and acyl-carnitine pools, accompanied by progressive failure of the reacylation process after chemically induced membrane lipid damage.

Few effective measures exist to prevent RBC alloimmunization and/or eliminate alloantibodies in sensitized patients. Donor-related factors may influence alloimmunization; thus, there is an unmet clinical need to identify which RBC units are immunogenic. Repeat volunteer blood donors and donors on iron supplements have elevated reticulocyte counts compared to healthy non-donors. Early reticulocytes retain mitochondria and other components, which may act as danger signals in immune responses. Herein, we tested whether reticulocytes in donor RBC units could enhance RBC alloimmunization. Using a murine model, we demonstrate that transfusing donor RBC units with increased reticulocyte frequencies dose-dependently increased RBC alloimmunization rates and alloantibody levels.

Few effective measures exist to prevent RBC alloimmunization and/or eliminate alloantibodies in sensitized patients. Donor-related factors may influence alloimmunization; thus, there is an unmet clinical need to identify which RBC units are immunogenic. Repeat volunteer blood donors and donors on iron supplements have elevated reticulocyte counts compared to healthy non-donors. Early reticulocytes retain mitochondria and other components, which may act as danger signals in immune responses.

A first standard blood donation was followed by the gold-standard measure for red cell storage quality: a 51-chromium posttransfusion red cell recovery study. Donors were then randomized to intravenous iron repletion (1 g low-molecular-weight iron dextran) or placebo. A second donation \u223c5 months later was followed by another recovery study. Primary outcome was the within-subject change in posttransfusion recovery. The primary outcome measure of an ancillary study reported here was the National Institutes of Health Toolbox-derived uncorrected standard Cognition Fluid Composite Score. Overall, 983\u00a0donors were screened; 110 were iron-deficient, and of these, 39 were randomized to iron repletion and 40 to placebo. Red cell storage quality was unchanged by iron repletion: mean change in posttransfusion recovery was 1.6% (95% confidence interval\u00a0-0.5 to 3.8) and\u00a0-0.4% (-2.0 to 1.2) with and without iron, respectively. Iron repletion did not affect any cognition or well-being measures. These data provide evidence that current criteria for blood donation preserve red cell transfusion quality for the recipient and protect adult donors from measurable effects of blood donation-induced iron deficiency on cognition.

Dietary PUFAs are readily incorporated into the RBC membrane, improving RBC deformability, fluidity, and hydration. However, enriching the lipid membrane with PUFAs increases the potential for peroxidation in oxidative environments (e.g., refrigerated storage), resulting in membrane damage. Substitution of bis-allylic hydrogens with deuterium ions in PUFAs decreases hydrogen abstraction, thereby inhibiting peroxidation. If lipid peroxidation is a causal factor in the RBC storage lesion, incorporation of deuterated linoleic acid (DLA) into the RBC membrane should decrease lipid peroxidation, thereby improving RBC lifespan, deformability, filterability, and post-transfusion recovery (PTR) after cold storage. Study Design and Methods: Mice associated with good (C57BL/6J) and poor (FVB) RBC storage quality received diets containing 11,11-D2-LA Ethyl Ester (1.0\u00a0g/100\u00a0g diet; deuterated linoleic acid) or non-deuterated LA Ethyl Ester (control) for 8\u00a0weeks.

Compared to the other species, guinea pig red blood cells showed aberrant glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway end product metabolites, purine breakdown products, methylation, glutaminolysis, and markers of membrane lipid remodeling. Consistently, guinea pig red blood cells demonstrated higher end storage hemolysis, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed a higher degree of morphological alterations of their red blood cells, as compared to the other species. Despite a genetic inability to produce ascorbate that is common to the species evaluated, guinea pig red blood cells demonstrate accelerated oxidant stress under standard storage conditions. These data may offer relevant insights into the basal and cold storage metabolism of red blood cells from species that cannot synthesize endogenous ascorbate.", "Keywords": ["ascorbate", "comparative biology", "erythrocyte", "hemolysis", "metabolomics", "rodent"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Bertolone", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hye Kyung H", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jin Hyen", "Last Name": "Baek", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yamei", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35087853", "Title": "The Impact of Age and BMI on the VWF/ADAMTS13 Axis and Simultaneous Thrombin and Plasmin Generation in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients.", "Abstract": "Aging and obesity independently contribute toward an endothelial dysfunction that results in an imbalanced VWF to ADAMTS13 ratio. In addition, plasma thrombin and plasmin generation are elevated and reduced, respectively, with increasing age and also with increasing body mass index (BMI). The severity risk of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases in adults older than 65 and in individuals with certain pre-existing health conditions, including obesity (>30 kg/m2). The present cross-sectional study focused on an analysis of the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, including measurements of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (VWF:AG), VWF collagen binding activity (VWF:CBA), Factor VIII antigen, ADAMTS13 antigen, and ADAMTS13 activity, in addition to thrombin and plasmin generation potential, in a demographically diverse population of COVID-19 negative (-) (n = 288) and COVID-19 positive (+) (n = 543) patient plasmas collected at the time of hospital presentation. Data were analyzed as a whole, and then after dividing patients by age (<65 and \u226565) and independently by BMI [<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, >30 (kg/m2)]. These analyses suggest that VWF parameters (i.e., the VWF/ADAMTS13 activity ratio) and thrombin and plasmin generation differed in COVID-19 (+), as compared to COVID-19 (-) patient plasma. Further, age (\u226565) more than BMI contributed to aberrant plasma indicators of endothelial coagulopathy. Based on these findings, evaluating both the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, along with thrombin and plasmin generation, could provide insight into the extent of endothelial dysfunction as well as the plasmatic imbalance in coagulation and fibrinolysis potential, particularly for at-risk patient populations.", "Keywords": ["ADAMTS13", "COVID-19", "plasmin", "thrombin", "von Willebrand factor"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kiruphagaran", "Last Name": "Thangaraju", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Katneni", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Imo J", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Saini", "Last Name": "Setua", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Cendali", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fabia", "Last Name": "Gamboni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stacie", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexander Z", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jacob E", "Last Name": "Valk", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Blood Oxygen Transport and Hemostasis, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in medicine", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34793330", "Title": "Donor genetic and nongenetic factors affecting red blood cell transfusion effectiveness.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDRBC transfusion effectiveness varies due to donor, component, and recipient factors. Prior studies identified characteristics associated with variation in hemoglobin increments following transfusion. We extended these observations, examining donor genetic and nongenetic factors affecting transfusion effectiveness.METHODSThis is a multicenter retrospective study of 46,705 patients and 102,043 evaluable RBC transfusions from 2013 to 2016 across 12 hospitals. Transfusion effectiveness was defined as hemoglobin, bilirubin, or creatinine increments following single RBC unit transfusion. Models incorporated a subset of donors with data on single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with osmotic and oxidative hemolysis in vitro. Mixed modeling accounting for repeated transfusion episodes identified predictors of transfusion effectiveness.RESULTSBlood donor (sex, Rh status, fingerstick hemoglobin, smoking), component (storage duration, \u03b3 irradiation, leukoreduction, apheresis collection, storage solution), and recipient (sex, BMI, race and ethnicity, age) characteristics were associated with hemoglobin and bilirubin, but not creatinine, increments following RBC transfusions. Increased storage duration was associated with increased bilirubin and decreased hemoglobin increments, suggestive of in vivo hemolysis following transfusion. Donor G6PD deficiency and polymorphisms in SEC14L4, HBA2, and MYO9B genes were associated with decreased hemoglobin increments. Donor G6PD deficiency and polymorphisms in SEC14L4 were associated with increased transfusion requirements in the subsequent 48 hours.CONCLUSIONDonor genetic and other factors, such as RBC storage duration, affect transfusion effectiveness as defined by decreased hemoglobin or increased bilirubin increments. Addressing these factors will provide a precision medicine approach to improve patient outcomes, particularly for chronically transfused RBC recipients, who would most benefit from more effective transfusion products.FUNDINGFunding was provided by HHSN 75N92019D00032, HHSN 75N92019D00034, 75N92019D00035, HHSN 75N92019D00036, and HHSN 75N92019D00037; R01HL126130; and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).", "Keywords": ["Clinical practice", "Genetic variation", "Hematology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Donors", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Female", "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency", "Hemoglobins", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nareg H", "Last Name": "Roubinian", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Reese", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Plimier", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, RTI International, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Grier P", "Last Name": "Page", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, RTI International, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ritchard G", "Last Name": "Cable", "Affiliation": "American Red Cross, Farmington, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Custer", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark T", "Last Name": "Gladwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruchika", "Last Name": "Goel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bob", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamir", "Last Name": "Kanias", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Kleinman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Victoria, British Colombia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Mast", "Affiliation": "Versiti Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven R", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan R", "Last Name": "Spencer", "Affiliation": "American Red Cross, Dedham, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Busch", "Affiliation": "Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study IV Pediatrics (REDS-IV-P)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2022Jan11"}, {"PMID": "34571942", "Title": "Biological and Clinical Factors Contributing to the Metabolic Heterogeneity of Hospitalized Patients with and without COVID-19.", "Abstract": "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an ongoing worldwide challenge.

Moreover, G6PD deficiency is associated with kidney disease, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, immunological defects, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the only available mouse models have decreased levels of WT stable G6PD caused by promoter mutations. However, human G6PD mutations are missense mutations that result in decreased enzymatic stability. As such, this results in very low activity in red blood cells (RBCs) that cannot synthesize new protein. To generate a more accurate model, the human sequence for a severe form of G6PD deficiency, Med(-), was knocked into the murine G6PD locus. As predicted, G6PD levels were extremely low in RBCs, and deficient mice had increased hemolytic sequelae to oxidant stress. Nonerythroid organs had metabolic changes consistent with mild G6PD deficiency, consistent with what has been observed in humans.

Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Imo", "Last Name": "Akpan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Cendali", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Fabia", "Last Name": "Gamboni", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver."}, {"First Name": "Kiruphagaran", "Last Name": "Thangaraju", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Katneni", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Stacie", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Valk", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Moriconi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Eldad", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2021May10"}, {"PMID": "34013020", "Title": "The New York State SARS-CoV-2 Testing Consortium: Regional Communication in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, created an unprecedented need for comprehensive laboratory testing of populations, in order to meet the needs of medical practice and to guide the management and functioning of our society. With the greater New York metropolitan area as an epicenter of this pandemic beginning in March 2020, a consortium of laboratory leaders from the assembled New York academic medical institutions was formed to help identify and solve the challenges of deploying testing. This report brings forward the experience of this consortium, based on the real-world challenges which we encountered in testing patients and in supporting the recovery effort to reestablish the health care workplace. In coordination with the Greater New York Hospital Association and with the public health laboratory of New York State, this consortium communicated with state leadership to help inform public decision-making addressing the crisis. Through the length of the pandemic, the consortium has been a critical mechanism for sharing experience and best practices in dealing with issues including the following: instrument platforms, sample sources, test performance, pre- and post-analytical issues, supply chain, institutional testing capacity, pooled testing, biospecimen science, and research. The consortium also has been a mechanism for staying abreast of state and municipal policies and initiatives, and their impact on institutional and laboratory operations. The experience of this consortium may be of value to current and future laboratory professionals and policy-makers alike, in dealing with major events that impact regional laboratory services.",

data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are limited.METHODSWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19 at 5 sites in New York City (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival. A possible explanation is that survivors remained hospitalized at their baseline clinical status.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04359810.FUNDINGAmazon Foundation, Skoll Foundation.",

Among these, a subpopulation of small RBCs, comprising type III echinocytes, spheroechinocytes, and spherocytes and defined as storage-induced microerythrocytes (SMEs), could be rapidly cleared from circulation posttransfusion. We quantified the proportion of SMEs in RBC concentrates from healthy human volunteers and assessed correlation with transfusion recovery, investigated the fate of SMEs upon perfusion through human spleen ex vivo, and explored where and how SMEs are cleared in a mouse model of blood storage and transfusion. In healthy human volunteers, high proportion of SMEs in long-stored RBC concentrates correlated with poor transfusion recovery. When perfused through human spleen, 15% and 61% of long-stored RBCs and SMEs were cleared in 70 minutes, respectively. High initial proportion of SMEs also correlated with high retention of RBCs by perfused human spleen. In the mouse model, SMEs accumulated during storage. Transfusion of long-stored RBCs resulted in reduced posttransfusion recovery, mostly due to SME clearance. After transfusion in mice, long-stored RBCs accumulated predominantly in spleen and were ingested mainly by splenic and hepatic macrophages. In macrophage-depleted mice, splenic accumulation and SME clearance were delayed, and transfusion recovery was improved. In healthy hosts, SMEs were cleared predominantly by macrophages in spleen and liver. When this well-demarcated subpopulation of altered RBCs was abundant in RBC concentrates, transfusion recovery was diminished.

The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome-wide-association-analyses and country-level meta-regression analyses. ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection by ABO type. For example, anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies (e.g. present in group O individuals) could bind to corresponding antigens on the viral envelope and contribute to viral neutralization, thereby preventing target cell infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV spike (S) proteins may be bound by anti-A isoagglutinins (e.g. present in group O and group B individuals), which may block interactions between virus and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-receptor, thereby preventing entry into lung epithelial cells. ABO type-associated variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels. In conclusion, group O may be associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and group A may be associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with severe disease. However, prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to verify several of the proposed associations.

The results indicated similarities and differences across species, which ultimately resulted in a differential propensity to undergo morphological alterations and lyse as a function of the duration of refrigerated storage. Focusing on purine oxidation, carboxylic acid, fatty acid, and arginine metabolism further highlighted species-specific metabolic wiring. For example, through a combination of steady state measurements and 13C6 15N4-arginine tracing experiments, we report an increase in arginine catabolism into ornithine in humans, suggestive of species-specific arginase 1 activity and nitric oxide synthesis-an observation that may impact the translatability of cardiovascular disease studies carried out in non-human primates (NHPs).

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading and metabolic rewiring toward the hexose monophosphate shunt, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be less capable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation/oxidant stress when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and vice versa.", "Keywords": ["AE1", "SARS-CoV-2", "band 3", "erythrocyte", "lipidomics", "metabolomics", "proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Erythrocytes", "Humans", "Lipidomics", "Membrane Lipids", "Membrane Proteins", "Metabolome", "Models, Molecular", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Proteome", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Issaian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ryan C", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of proteome research", "PubDate": "2020Nov06"}, {"PMID": "32786691", "Title": "Serum Proteomics in COVID-19 Patients: Altered Coagulation and Complement Status as a Function of IL-6 Level.", "Abstract": "Over 5 million people around the world have tested positive for the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as of May 29, 2020, a third of which are in the United States alone. These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs).

However, with the regulatory approval, in 1968, of IgG anti-Rh(D) immunoprophylaxis to prevent maternal sensitization, the prospect of eradicating Rh disease was at hand. Indeed, the combination of antenatal and post-partum immunoprophylaxis is ~99% effective at preventing maternal sensitization to Rh(D). To investigate global compliance with this therapeutic intervention, we used an epidemiological approach to estimate the current annual number of pregnancies worldwide involving an Rh(D)-negative mother and an Rh(D)-positive fetus. The annual number of doses of anti-Rh(D) IgG required for successful immunoprophylaxis for these cases was then calculated and compared with an estimate of the annual number of doses of anti-Rh(D) produced and provided worldwide. Our results suggest that ~50% of the women around the world who require this type of immunoprophylaxis do not receive it, presumably due to a lack of awareness, availability, and/or affordability, thereby putting hundreds of thousands of fetuses and neonates at risk for Rh disease each year.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Issaian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryan C", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2020Jun30"}, {"PMID": "32559180", "Title": "COVID-19 infection alters kynurenine and fatty acid metabolism, correlating with IL-6 levels and renal status.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDReprogramming of host metabolism supports viral pathogenesis by fueling viral proliferation, by providing, for example, free amino acids and fatty acids as building blocks.METHODSTo investigate metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum metabolites of patients with COVID-19 (n = 33; diagnosed by nucleic acid testing), as compared with COVID-19-negative controls (n = 16).RESULTSTargeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses identified altered tryptophan metabolism into the kynurenine pathway, which regulates inflammation and immunity.

suggest a role for systemic reprogramming of host metabolism during viral pathogenesis to fuel rapidly expanding viral proliferation, for example by providing free amino acids and fatty acids as building blocks. In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Bertolone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2020May16"}, {"PMID": "32425810", "Title": "Metabolic Reprogramming of Mouse Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages Following Erythrophagocytosis.", "Abstract": "Reticuloendothelial macrophages engulf \u223c0.2 trillion senescent erythrocytes daily in a process called erythrophagocytosis (EP). This critical mechanism preserves systemic heme-iron homeostasis by regulating red blood cell (RBC) catabolism and iron recycling. Although extensive work has demonstrated the various effects on macrophage metabolic reprogramming by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines, little is known about the impact of EP on the macrophage metabolome and proteome. Thus, we performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics analyses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) before and after EP of IgG-coated RBCs. Further, metabolomics was performed on BMDMs incubated with free IgG to ensure that changes to macrophage metabolism were due to opsonized RBCs and not to free IgG binding. Uniformly labeled tracing experiments were conducted on BMDMs in the presence and absence of IgG-coated RBCs to assess the flux of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In this study, we demonstrate that EP significantly alters amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, the Krebs cycle, OXPHOS, and arachidonate-linoleate metabolism. Increases in levels of amino acids, lipids and oxylipins, heme products, and RBC-derived proteins are noted in BMDMs following EP. Tracing experiments with U-13C6 glucose indicated a slower flux through glycolysis and enhanced PPP activation. Notably, we show that it is fueled by glucose derived from the macrophages themselves or from the extracellular media prior to EP, but not from opsonized RBCs. The PPP-derived NADPH can then fuel the oxidative burst, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species necessary to promote digestion of phagocytosed RBC proteins via radical attack. Results were confirmed by redox proteomics experiments, demonstrating the oxidation of Cys152 and Cys94 of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hemoglobin-\u03b2, respectively. Significant increases in early Krebs cycle and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolites (\u03b1-ketoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate, respectively) indicate that EP promotes the dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Lastly, EP stimulated aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase and arginase activity as indicated by significant accumulations of ALA and ornithine after IgG-mediated RBC ingestion. Importantly, EP-mediated metabolic reprogramming of BMDMs does not occur following exposure to IgG alone. In conclusion, we show that EP reprograms macrophage metabolism and modifies macrophage polarization.", "Keywords": ["OXPHOS", "blood", "lipid accumulation", "macrophage metabolism", "mitochondrial dysregulation", "omics technologies", "pentose phosphate pathway"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexis", "Last Name": "Catala", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lyla A", "Last Name": "Youssef", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika", "Last Name": "Dzieciatkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine - Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Marchetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine - Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Karafin", "Affiliation": "Medical Sciences Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin (Versiti), Milwaukee, WI, United States."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krystalyn E", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kirk C", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32254064", "Title": "Deployment of convalescent plasma for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., \"convalescent\") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).

blood quality for transfusion.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency decreases the ability of red blood cells (RBCs) to withstand oxidative stress. Refrigerated storage of RBCs induces oxidative stress. We hypothesized that G6PD-deficient donor RBCs would have inferior storage quality for transfusion as compared with G6PD-normal RBCs.METHODSMale volunteers were screened for G6PD deficiency; 27 control and 10 G6PD-deficient volunteers each donated 1 RBC unit. After 42 days of refrigerated storage, autologous 51-chromium 24-hour posttransfusion RBC recovery (PTR) studies were performed. Metabolomics analyses of these RBC units were also performed.RESULTSThe mean 24-hour PTR for G6PD-deficient subjects was 78.5% \u00b1 8.4% (mean \u00b1 SD), which was significantly lower than that for G6PD-normal RBCs (85.3% \u00b1 3.2%; P = 0.0009). None of the G6PD-normal volunteers (0/27) and 3 G6PD-deficient volunteers (3/10) had PTR results below 75%, a key FDA acceptability criterion for stored donor RBCs. As expected, fresh G6PD-deficient RBCs demonstrated defects in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. During refrigerated storage, G6PD-deficient RBCs demonstrated increased glycolysis, impaired glutathione homeostasis, and increased purine oxidation, as compared with G6PD-normal RBCs. In addition, there were significant correlations between PTR and specific metabolites in these pathways.CONCLUSIONBased on current FDA criteria, RBCs from G6PD-deficient donors would not meet the requirements for storage quality. Metabolomics assessment identified markers of PTR and G6PD deficiency (e.g., pyruvate/lactate ratios), along with potential compensatory pathways that could be leveraged to ameliorate the metabolic needs of G6PD-deficient RBCs.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04081272.FUNDINGThe Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development Program, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant 71590, the National Blood

translational science. However, little is known about the metabolism of Rhesus macaque red blood cells (RBC) and how this compares to human RBC metabolism under standard blood banking conditions. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses, and tracing experiments with [1,2,3-13C3]glucose, were performed using fresh and stored RBC (sampled weekly until storage day 42) obtained from Rhesus macaques (n=20) and healthy human volunteers (n=21). These results were further validated with targeted quantification against stable isotope-labeled internal standards. Metabolomic analyses demonstrated inter-species differences in RBC metabolism independent of refrigerated storage. Although similar trends were observed throughout storage for several metabolic pathways, species- and sex-specific differences were also observed. The most notable differences were in glutathione and sulfur metabolites, purine and lipid oxidation metabolites, acylcarnitines, fatty acyl composition of several classes of lipids (including phosphatidylserines), glyoxylate pathway intermediates, and arginine and carboxylic acid metabolites. Species-specific dietary and environmental compounds were also detected. Overall, the results suggest an increased basal and refrigerator-storage-induced propensity for oxidant stress and lipid remodeling in Rhesus macaque RBC cells, as compared to human red cells. The overlap between Rhesus macaque and human RBC metabolic phenotypes suggests the potential utility of a translational model for simple RBC transfusions, although inter-species storage-dependent differences need to be considered when modeling complex disease states, such as transfusion in trauma/hemorrhagic shock models.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Banks", "Blood Preservation", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Humans", "Macaca mulatta", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Stefanoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO."}, {"First Name": "Hye Kyung H", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD."}, {"First Name": "Jin Hyen", "Last Name": "Baek", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD."}, {"First Name": "Devin P", "Last Name": "Champagne", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO."}, {"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Richard O", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "BloodWorks Northwest, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Tatsuro", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Hemanext Inc, Lexington, MA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Reisz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Buehler", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD Paul.Buehler@fda.hhs.gov."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "D'Alessandro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO angelo.dalessandro@ucdenver.edu."}], "Journal": "Haematologica", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "31558553", "Title": "A rose is a rose is a rose, or not.", "Abstract": "In this issue of Blood, Roubinian et al provide important evidence to confirm, and refute, a long-standing maxim in clinical medicine that a 1-unit transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) should yield a posttransfusion hemoglobin increment of 1 g/dL.

They are also a critically important component of host defense, protecting against invading pathogens. However, the effects on macrophage biology of acutely ingesting large numbers of RBCs are not completely understood. To investigate this issue, we used a mouse model of RBC transfusion and clearance, which mimics the clinical setting. In this model, transfusions of refrigerator storage-damaged (ie, \"old\") RBCs led to increased erythrophagocytosis by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). This robust erythrophagocytosis induced ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, in RPMs. This was accompanied by increases in reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in vivo, which were reduced by treatment in vitro with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Old RBC transfusions also induced RPM-dependent chemokine expression by splenic Ly6Chi monocytes, which signaled Ly6Chi monocyte migration from bone marrow to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of cell division among remaining splenic RPMs, along with the influx of bone marrow-derived Ly6Chi monocytes, suggests that, following RPM depletion induced by robust erythrophagocytosis, there is a coordinated effort to restore homeostasis of the RPM population by local self-maintenance and contributions from circulating monocytes.

However, it is unclear whether accumulation of intracellular and supernatant hypoxanthine in stored red blood cell units is clinically relevant for transfused recipients. Leukoreduced red blood cells from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-normal or -deficient human volunteers were stored in AS-3 under normoxic, hyperoxic, or hypoxic conditions (with oxygen saturation ranging from <3% to >95%). Red blood cells from healthy human volunteers were also collected at sea level or after 1-7 days at high altitude (>5000 m). Finally, C57BL/6J mouse red blood cells were incubated in vitro with 13C1-aspartate or 13C5-adenosine under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, with or without deoxycoformycin, a purine deaminase inhibitor. Metabolomics analyses were performed on human and mouse red blood cells stored for up to 42 or 14 days, respectively, and correlated with 24 h post-transfusion red blood cell recovery. Hypoxanthine increased in stored red blood cell units as a function of oxygen levels. Stored red blood cells from human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient donors had higher levels of deaminated purines. Hypoxia in vitro and in vivo decreased purine oxidation and enhanced purine salvage reactions in human and mouse red blood cells, which was partly explained by decreased adenosine monophosphate deaminase activity. In addition, hypoxanthine levels negatively correlated with post-transfusion red blood cell recovery in mice and - preliminarily albeit significantly - in humans. In conclusion, hypoxanthine is an in vitro metabolic marker of the red blood cell storage lesion that negatively correlates with post-transfusion recovery in vivo Storage-dependent hypoxanthine accumulation is ameliorated by hypoxia-induced decreases in purine deamination reaction rates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Preservation", "Deamination", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Humans", "Hypoxanthine", "Hypoxia", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Purines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Travis", "Last Name": "Nemkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver -

Because K3Cys maintains recognition of its cognate ligand, the iron siderophore enterochelin, this protein can capture and transport iron even in the acidic conditions of urine.

Despite ABO matching, RBC transfusions can lead to production of alloantibodies against \"minor\" blood group antigens. Non-ABO alloimmunization is a leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality in the U.S. Despite its clinical importance, little is known about the immunological factors that promote alloimmunization. Prior studies indicate that inflammatory conditions place patients at higher risk for alloimmunization. Additionally, co-exposure to pro-inflammatory pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) promotes alloimmunization in animal models, suggesting that RBC alloimmunization depends on innate immune cell activation. However, the specific innate immune stimuli and sensors that induce a T cell-dependent alloantibody response to transfused RBCs have not been identified. The NLRP3 inflammasome senses chemically diverse PAMPs and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including extracellular ATP and iron-containing heme. We hypothesized that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by endogenous DAMPs from RBCs promotes the alloimmune response to a sterile RBC transfusion. Using genetically modified mice lacking either NLRP3 or multiple downstream inflammasome response elements, we ruled out a role for the NLRP3 inflammasome or any Caspase-1 or -11 dependent inflammasome in regulating RBC alloantibody production to a model antigen.", "Keywords": ["Alloimmunization", "Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)", "Inflammasome", "NLRP3", "Red blood cell (RBC) storage"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Group Antigens", "Cytokines", "Dendritic Cells", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Immunomodulation", "Immunophenotyping", "Inflammasomes", "Inflammation", "Isoantibodies", "Isoantigens", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Animal", "Models, Biological", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Gibb", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuele", "Last Name": "Calabro", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Tormey", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital, NY, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Bloodworks NW Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98102, USA; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98102, USA; Department of Internal Medicine-Division of Hematology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98102, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanne E", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital, NY, New York 10032, USA.

Long-lived antibody responses typically require CD4(+) T cell help and, in murine transfusion models, alloimmunization requires a spleen. Yet, it is not known how RBC-derived antigens are presented to naive T cells in the spleen. We sought to answer whether splenic dendritic cells (DCs) were essential for T cell priming to RBC alloantigens. Transient deletion of conventional DCs at the time of transfusion or splenic DC preactivation before RBC transfusion abrogated T and B cell responses to allogeneic RBCs, even though transfused RBCs persisted in the circulation for weeks. Although all splenic DCs phagocytosed RBCs and activated RBC-specific CD4(+) T cells in vitro, only bridging channel 33D1(+) DCs were required for alloimmunization in vivo. In contrast, deletion of XCR1(+)CD8(+) DCs did not alter the immune response to RBCs.

The meeting's goal was to identify important research questions that could be answered in the next 5 to 10 years and which would have the potential to transform the clinical practice of transfusion medicine. These questions could be addressed by basic, translational, and/or clinical research studies and were focused on four areas: the three \"classical\" transfusion products (i.e., red blood cells, platelets, and plasma) and blood donor issues. Before the meeting, four working groups, one for each area, prepared five major questions for discussion along with a list of five to 10 additional questions for consideration. At the meeting itself, all of these questions, and others, were discussed in keynote lectures, small-group breakout sessions, and large-group sessions with open discourse involving all meeting attendees. In addition to the final lists of questions, provided herein, the meeting attendees identified multiple overarching, cross-cutting themes that addressed issues common to all four areas; the latter are also provided.

The consequences and potential selective advantages of such PFT host limitation have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, PFT ligation of hCD59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing hCD59. Because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, RBCs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. RBC programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on Fas/FasL signaling and RIP1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. Death due to programmed necrosis in RBCs is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, NADPH oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products.

RBC programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature RBCs.

Children and pregnant women are at highest risk for developing iron deficiency because of their increased iron requirements. Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects on fetal development, including low birth weight, growth retardation, hypertension, intrauterine fetal death, neurologic impairment, and premature birth. We hypothesized that pregnant mice fed an iron-deficient diet would have a similar outcome regarding fetal growth to that of humans. To this end, we randomly assigned female C57BL/6 mice to consume 1 of 4 diets (high-iron-low-bioavailability, high-iron-high-bioavailability, iron-replete, and iron-deficient) for 4 wk before breeding, followed by euthanasia on day 17 to 18 of gestation. Compared with all other groups, dams fed the high-iron-high-bioavailability diet had significantly higher liver iron. Hct and Hgb levels in dams fed the iron-deficient diet were decreased by at least 2.5 g/dL as compared with those of all other groups. In addition, the percentage of viable pups among dams fed the iron-deficient diet was lower than that of all other groups. Finally, compared with all other groups, fetuses from dams fed the iron-deficient diet had lower fetal brain iron levels, shorter crown-rump lengths, and lower weights. In summary, mice fed an iron-deficient diet had similar hematologic values and fetal outcomes as those of iron-deficient humans, making this a useful model for studying iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Body Weight", "Female", "Fertility", "Fetal Development", "Hematocrit", "Hemoglobins", "Iron Deficiencies", "Iron, Dietary", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea C", "Last Name": "Hubbard", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Institute of Comparative Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA. ah2911@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Bandyopadhyay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Boguslaw S", "Last Name": "Wojczyk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin A", "Last Name": "Prestia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Comparative medicine", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23441757", "Title": "On the appropriate use and interpretation of animal models in transfusion medicine research.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Models, Animal", "Research", "Transfusion Medicine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Zimring", "Affiliation": "Puget Sound Blood Center Research Institute, Seattle, Washington; Laboratory of Transfusion Biology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transfusion", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23321203", "Title": "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 and mortality in a multi-ethnic cohort: the Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "to study the association between soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) levels and mortality in the population-based Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcohol Drinking", "Biomarkers", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Insurance, Health", "Likelihood Functions", "Male", "Medicaid", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "New York City", "Odds Ratio", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Social Class", "Time Factors", "United States", "Urban Health", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jorge M", "Last Name": "Luna", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. jl2708@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Yeseon", "Last Name": "Moon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Khin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Spitalnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myunghee", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ralph", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Age and ageing", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23033973", "Title": "Resistance of a subset of red blood cells to clearance by antibodies in a mouse model of incompatible transfusion.", "Abstract": "Alloimmunization to antigens on transfused red blood cells (RBCs) represents a major barrier to chronic transfusion.
