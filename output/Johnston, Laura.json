However, a significant number of patients will experience post-AHCT disease relapse. Here, we report a retrospective study of consecutive 124 patients with PTCLs who underwent AHCT from 2008 to 2020. With a median follow-up of 6.01\u2009years following AHCT, 49 patients (40%) experienced disease relapse. As expected, more patients who were not in first complete remission experienced post-AHCT relapse. Following relapse, majority of the patients (70%) receiving systemic therapies intended as bridging to curative allogeneic HCT. However, only 18 (53%) patients eventually underwent allogeneic HCT. The estimated 3-year OS among patients proceeding to allogeneic HCT was 72% (95% CI 46%-87%).

major complication. The use of donor T-regulatory cells (Tregs) to prevent GVHD appears promising, including in our previous evaluation of an engineered graft product (T-reg graft) consisting of the timed, sequential infusion of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and high-purity Tregs followed by conventional T cells. However, whether immunosuppressive prophylaxis can be removed from this protocol remains unclear. We report the results of the first stage of an open-label single-center phase 2 study (NCT01660607) investigating T-reg graft in myeloablative HCT of HLA-matched and 9/10-matched recipients. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive T-reg graft alone (n\u00a0= 12) or T-reg graft plus single-agent GVHD prophylaxis (n\u00a0= 12) to determine whether T-reg graft alone was noninferior in preventing acute GVHD. All patients developed full-donor myeloid chimerism. Patients with T-reg graft alone vs with prophylaxis had incidences of grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD of 58% vs 8% (P\u00a0= .005) and grade 3 to 4 of 17% vs 0% (P\u00a0= .149), respectively. The incidence of moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD was 28% in the T-reg graft alone arm vs 0% with prophylaxis (P\u00a0= .056). Among patients with T-reg graft and prophylaxis, CD4+ T-cell-to-Treg ratios were reduced after transplantation, gene expression profiles showed reduced CD4+ proliferation, and the achievement of full-donor T-cell chimerism was delayed. This study indicates that T-reg graft with single-agent tacrolimus is preferred over T-reg graft alone for the prevention of acute GVHD.

Mechanistically, Axin2 suppresses the p53 signaling pathway at the post-transcriptional level to maintain cell fitness, and Axin2-deficient cell elimination requires p53-dependent signaling. Furthermore, mosaic Trp53 deletion confers a \"winner\" status to p53-deficient cells that outcompete their neighbors.

We evaluated how outcomes and practice patterns have changed for patients with R/R cHL who underwent autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) at our institution from 2011 to 2020 (N\u00a0= 183) compared with those from 2001 to 2010 (N\u00a0= 159) and evaluated prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both eras. OS was superior in the modern era with a trend toward lower nonrelapse mortality beyond 2 years after transplant. Among patients who progressed after AHCT, 4-year postprogression survival increased from 43.3% to 71.4% in the modern era, reflecting increasing use of BV and the PD-1 inhibitors. In multivariable analysis for patients that underwent transplant in the modern era, age \u226545 years, primary refractory disease, and lack of complete remission pre-AHCT were associated with inferior PFS, whereas receipt of a PD-1 inhibitor-based regimen pre-AHCT was associated with superior PFS.

We hypothesized that advances in ALL and transplantation have resulted in improved HCT outcomes in recent years. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of adult ALL patients undergoing allogeneic HCT over the last decade. Patients with ALL aged 18 years and older who underwent allogeneic HCT at Stanford University between 2008 and 2019 were included in this study. Patients were divided into 2 eras based on year of HCT: 2008 to 2013 (earlier era) and 2014 to 2019 (later era). A total of 285 patients were included: 119 patients underwent HCT in the earlier era and 166 in the later era. Patients who underwent transplantation in the later era were more likely to be Hispanic (38% versus 21%) and to have an HCT-comorbidity index \u22653 (31% versus 18%). Donor source for HCT also differed with an increase in the use of HLA-mismatched donor sources (38% versus 24%), notably umbilical cord blood in the later era (16% versus 0%). Patients in the later era were less likely to undergo transplantation with active disease (4% versus 16%); pre-HCT rates of measurable residual disease were similar across the eras (38% versus 40%).

Multivariable analysis confirmed the association between later era and OS (hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.34-0.78). Finally, among patients relapsing after HCT (25% in later era and 33% in earlier era), the use of novel immunotherapies increased in the later era (44% versus 3%), as did the median OS after post-HCT relapse (16 months versus 8 months, P< .001).

Although logistically beneficial, the impact of cryopreservation on clinical outcomes and graft composition remains unclear. In this study, we compared outcomes and graft composition with cryopreserved versus fresh allografts in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 30 consecutive patients who received cryopreserved allografts between March and August 2020 and 60 consecutive patients who received fresh allografts before the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary endpoints were hematopoietic engraftment and graft failure (GF), and secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). In addition, extended immunophenotype analysis was performed on cryopreserved and prospectively collected fresh apheresis samples. Compared with recipients of fresh allografts, both neutrophil and platelet recovery were delayed in recipients of cryopreserved reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT, with a median time to engraftment of 24 days versus 18 days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) for neutrophils and 27 days versus 18 days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.069) for platelets. We observed primary GF in 4 of 30 patients in the cryopreserved cohort (13.3%) versus only 1 of 60 patients (1.7 %) in the fresh cohort (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Cryopreserved RIC allo-HCT was associated with significantly lower median total, myeloid, and T cell donor chimerism at 1 month. OS and RFS were inferior for cryopreserved graft recipients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 4.67) and HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.95 to 3.79, respectively. Using an extended immunophenotype analysis, we compared 14 samples from the cryopreserved cohort to 6 prospectively collected fresh apheresis donor samples. These analyses showed both a decrease in total cell viability and a significantly reduced absolute number of natural killer cells (CD3-CD56+) in the cryopreserved apheresis samples.

This behavior is also observed in Myc super-competition, where healthy wild type cells in growing wing discs of Drosophila are outcompeted by nearby cells that express higher levels of the Myc oncogene. Most work on Myc super-competition has examined it in mixed populations of male and female larvae. However, as physiological and genetic differences between Drosophila males and females could affect the competitive behavior of cells, we have investigated whether sex differences affect the process. Here we show that both male and female wing disc cells are subject to Myc super-competition. Female disc cells appear to be more sensitive to competitive elimination than male cells, potentially due to differences in baseline cellular Myc levels between the sexes. We also report sexual dimorphism of cell size and number between male and female growing wing discs that is independent of competition; wing discs and wing pouches from females are larger than males' due to larger cell size and cell number. We suggest that separately examining male and female tissues in cell competition assays could enhance our understanding of the effects of sex-specific pathways on cell and super-competition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abigail J", "Last Name": "Svoysky", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey L", "Last Name": "Bellah", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center."}], "Journal": "microPublication biology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34605187", "Title": "Comparison of polynomial fitting versus single time point analysis of ECIS data for barrier assessment.", "Abstract": "Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an in vitro methodology for measuring the barrier integrity of a variety of cell types, including pulmonary endothelial cells. These experiments are frequently used for in vitro assessment of lung injury. The data derived from ECIS experiments consists of repeated measures of resistance across an endothelial monolayer. As such, these data reflect the dynamic changes in electrical resistance that occur over time. Currently methodologies for assessing ECIS data rely on single point assessments of barrier function, such as the maximal drop in trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TERMax ). However, this approach ignores the myriad of changes in resistance that occur before and after the TERMax data point. Herein, we utilize polynomial curve fitting on experimentally generated ECIS data, thus allowing for comparing ECIS experiments by examining the mean polynomial coefficients between groups. We show that polynomial curves accurately fit a variety of ECIS data, and that concordance between TERMax and coefficient analysis varies by type of stimulus, suggesting that TERMax differences may not always correlate with a significant difference in the overall shape of the ECIS profile. Lastly, we identify factors that impact coefficient values obtained in our analyses, including the length of time devoted to baseline measurements before addition of stimuli. Polynomial coefficient analysis is another tool that can be used for more comprehensive interrogation of ECIS data to better understand the biological underpinnings that lead to changes in barrier dysfunction in vitro.", "Keywords": ["barrier function", "electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biosensing Techniques", "Cell Membrane", "Electric Impedance", "Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Lung", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karthik", "Last Name": "Suresh", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Servinsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naresh M", "Last Name": "Punjabi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven M", "Last Name": "Dudek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahendra", "Last Name": "Damarla", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}], "Journal": "Physiological reports", "PubDate": "2021Oct"}, {"PMID": "34569183", "Title": "PDE9A deficiency does not prevent chronic-hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in mice.", "Abstract": "Inhibition of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is a cornerstone of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapy. PDE9A, expressed in the heart and lung tissue, has the highest affinity for cGMP of all known PDEs. PDE9A deficiency protects mice against chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload via increased natriuretic peptide (NP)-dependent cGMP signaling. Chronic-hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CH-PH) is a model of chronic right ventricular (RV) pressure overload, and previous studies have demonstrated a protective role for NPs in the murine model. Therefore, we hypothesized that PDE9A deficiency would promote NP-dependent cGMP signaling and prevent RV remodeling in the CH-PH model, analogous to findings in the LV. We exposed wild-type and PDE9A-deficient (Pde9a-/- ) C57BL/6\u00a0mice to CH-PH for 3\u00a0weeks. We measured RV pressure, hypertrophy, and levels of lung and RV cGMP, PDE9A, PDE5A, and phosphorylation of the protein kinase G substrate VASP (vasodilatory-stimulated phosphoprotein) after CH-PH. In wild-type mice, CH-PH was associated with increased circulating ANP and lung PDE5A, but no increase in cGMP, PDE9A, or VASP phosphorylation. Downstream effectors of cGMP were not increased in Pde9a-/- mice exposed to CH-PH compared with Pde9a+/+ littermates, and CH-PH induced increases in RV pressure and hypertrophy were not attenuated in knockout mice.

However, as panel size and complexity increase, so too does the detail involved in designing and optimizing successful high-quality panels fit for downstream high-dimensional data analysis. In contrast to conventional flow cytometers, full-spectrum flow cytometers measure the entire emission spectrum of each fluorophore across all lasers. This allows for fluorophores with very similar emission maxima but unique overall spectral fingerprints to be used in conjunction, enabling relatively straightforward design of larger panels. Although a protocol for best practices in full-spectrum flow cytometry panel design has been published, there is still a knowledge gap in going from the theoretically designed panel to the necessary steps required for panel optimization. Here, we aim to guide users through the theory of optimizing a high-dimensional full-spectrum flow cytometry panel for immunophenotyping using comprehensive step-by-step protocols.

Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Report on Behalf of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.", "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is potentially curative for certain hematologic malignancies and nonmalignant diseases. The field of allo-HCT has witnessed significant advances, including broadening indications for transplantation, availability of alternative donor sources, less toxic preparative regimens, new cell manipulation techniques, and novel GVHD prevention methods, all of which have expanded the applicability of the procedure. These advances have led to clinical practice conundrums when applying traditional definitions of hematopoietic recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, because these may vary based on donor type, cell source, cell dose, primary disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and conditioning intensity, among other variables. To address these contemporary challenges, we surveyed a panel of allo-HCT experts in an attempt to standardize these definitions. We analyzed survey responses from adult and pediatric transplantation physicians separately. Consensus was achieved for definitions of neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, but not for delayed engraftment. Here we highlight the complexities associated with the management of mixed donor chimerism in malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, which remains an area for future research. We recognize that there are multiple other specific, and at times complex, clinical scenarios for which clinical management must be individualized.", "Keywords": ["Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation", "Donor chimerism", "Graft failure", "Graft rejection", "Hematopoietic recovery"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Child", "Chimerism", "Graft Rejection", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohamed A", "Last Name": "Kharfan-Dabaja", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.

Consensus guidelines recommend collecting sufficient stem cells in case there is a need for stem cell boost for delayed/poor engraftment or for future second ASCT. However, collecting and storing backup stem cells in all patients requires significant resources and cost, and the rates of backup stem cell utilization are not well studied. We sought to examine the utilization of backup stem cells (BSCs) in patients with MM undergoing ASCT. Patients with MM aged \u226518 years old who underwent first ASCT at our institution from January 2010 through December 2015 and collected sufficient stem cells for at least 2 transplants were included in this single-center retrospective study. This timeframe was selected to allow for adequate follow-up. A total of 393 patients were included. The median age was 58 years (range, 25-73). After a median follow-up of 6 years, the median progression-free survival (PFS) of the cohort was 3 years. Sixty-one percent (n\u00a0=\u00a0240) of patients progressed or relapsed. Chemotherapy-based mobilization was used in almost all patients (98%). The median total CD34+ cells collected was 18.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/kg (range, 3.4-112.4). A median of 5.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CD34+ cells/kg (range, 1.8-41.9) was infused during the first ASCT, and a median of 10.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CD34+ cells/kg (range, 1.5-104.5) was cryopreserved for future use. Of the patients, 6.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) used backup stem cells, with 2.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) using them for stem cell boost, 4.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a018) for a second salvage ASCT, including 1 patient for both stem cell boost and second ASCT. Rates of backup stem cell use among patients aged <60, 60-69, and \u226570 years were 7.8%, 5.7%, and 5.9%, respectively. There was a trend toward higher rates of backup stem cell use for second ASCT in patients who were younger, had suboptimal disease control at time of first ASCT, and longer PFS.

Lower CD34+ dose and older age at time of ASCT predicted need for stem cell boost. With new salvage therapies for relapsed MM, the rates of second ASCT are very low.

Only 40% of patients had recovered detectable CD19+ B cells by 1 year, and 50% of patients had a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells per \u03bcL by 18 months postinfusion. Patients with durable responses to axi-cel had significantly longer durations of B-cell aplasia, and this duration correlated strongly with the recovery of CD4+ T-cell counts. There were significantly more infections within the first 28 days compared with any other period of follow-up, with the majority being mild-moderate in severity. Receipt of corticosteroids was the only factor that predicted risk of infection in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-16.5). Opportunistic infections due to Pneumocystis jirovecii and varicella-zoster virus occurred up to 18 months postinfusion in patients who prematurely discontinued prophylaxis.

Baseline characteristics of patients in the two groups were similar. Median PFS from treatment start amongst patients undergoing ASCT (n\u2009=\u200938) vs. not (n\u2009=\u200941) was 41 months vs. 33 months, p\u2009=\u20090.03. There was no difference in OS, with estimated 5-year OS of 73% vs. 83%, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.86). Day +100 transplant-related mortality\u00a0(TRM) was 0%. ASCT was an independent favorable prognostic factor for PFS in multivariate analysis, after accounting for HCT-CI score, performance status, hematologic response, and maintenance. Finally, patients \u226570 years undergoing ASCT had similar PFS compared to a contemporaneous institutional cohort of patients <70 years (n\u2009=\u2009631) (median PFS from transplant: 36 vs. 47 months, p\u2009=\u20090.25). In this retrospective analysis, ASCT was associated with low TRM and better PFS in fit older adults with MM compared to non-transplant therapy, with comparable benefits as seen in younger patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Disease-Free Survival", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Multiple Myeloma", "Retrospective Studies", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Autologous", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Lemieux", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori S", "Last Name": "Muffly", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Rezvani", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Lowsky", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Iberri", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juliana K", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura J", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michaela", "Last Name": "Liedtke", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Negrin", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen-Kai", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Everett", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Shizuru", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Parveen", "Last Name": "Shiraz", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Arai", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Miklos", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Surbhi", "Last Name": "Sidana", "Affiliation": "Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.

The pathogenesis of PAH is not fully understood, but multiple studies have demonstrated links between elevated angiostatic factors, disease severity, and adverse clinical outcomes. ES (endostatin), one such circulating angiostatic peptide, is the cleavage product of the proteoglycan COL18A1 (collagen \u03b11[XVIII] chain). Elevated serum ES is associated with increased mortality and disease severity in PAH. A nonsynonymous variant of ES (aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution at amino acid 104; p.D104N) is associated with differences in PAH survival. Although COL18A1/ES expression is markedly increased in remodeled pulmonary vessels in PAH, the impact of ES on pulmonary endothelial cell (PEC) biology and molecular contributions to PAH severity remain undetermined. In the present study, we characterized the effects of exogenous ES on human PEC biology and signaling. We demonstrated that ES inhibits PEC migration, proliferation, and cell survival, with significant differences between human variants, indicating that they are functional genetic variants. ES promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of the transcriptional repressor ID1, increasing expression and release of TSP-1 (thrombospondin 1). ES inhibits PEC migration via an ID1/TSP-1/CD36-dependent pathway, in contrast to proliferation and apoptosis, which require both CD36 and CD47. Collectively, the data implicate ES as a novel negative regulator of ID1 and an upstream propagator of an angiostatic signal cascade converging on CD36 and CD47, providing insight into the cellular and molecular effects of a functional genetic variant linked to altered outcomes in PAH.", "Keywords": ["apoptosis", "endostatin", "migration", "proliferation", "pulmonary arterial hypertension"], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Collagen Type VIII", "Collagen Type XVIII", "Endostatins", "Endothelial Cells", "Endothelium", "Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension", "Human Genetics", "Humans", "Lung", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alice M", "Last Name": "Goyanes", "Affiliation": "Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio; and."}, {"First Name": "Aigul", "Last Name": "Moldobaeva", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Mery", "Last Name": "Marimoutou", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lidenys C", "Last Name": "Varela", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Laura F", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Meena M", "Last Name": "Aladdin", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Grace L", "Last Name": "Peloquin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Bo S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Mahendra", "Last Name": "Damarla", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Karthik", "Last Name": "Suresh", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Takahiro", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Todd M", "Last Name": "Kolb", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Hassoun", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Damico", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "31446198", "Title": "Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in the Treatment of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Updated 2019 Evidence-Based Review from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.", "Abstract": "The role of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is reviewed and critically evaluated in this systematic evidence-based review.

Literature searches reveal that little is known about the population of people who own PADs, the types of dogs used or the functions they provide. One third (n = 199) of PAD owners in Australia registered with the charity \"mindDog\" participated in an online survey designed to better understand the person and dog team. Participants learned about PADs through the internet (37%), health care practitioners (32%), or family/friends (30%). The dogs in the sample were of varying age, gender and breed. The most common reasons for people to choose a dog to be a PAD were temperament (60%) and size/weight (48%). Just under half (48%) of the dogs had been acquired by the owner specifically to be trained as a PAD, and the rest were existing pets. All the dogs were trained by the owner or a combination of the owner and a qualified trainer; none were trained exclusively by assistance/service dog provider organizations.

The use of highly purified primary graft Tregs for direct cell infusion has potential advantages over impure immunomagnetic selection or culture expansion, but has not been tested clinically. We performed a phase I study of the timed addition of CD34-selected hematopoietic stem cells and Tregs, followed by Tcons for the treatment of patients with high-risk hematological malignancies.METHODSWe present interim evaluation of a single-center open phase I/II study of administration of human leukocyte-matched Tregs and CD34-selected hematopoietic cells, followed by infusion of an equal ratio of Tcons in adult patients undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) for high-risk or active hematological malignancies. Tregs were purified by immunomagnetic selection and high-speed cell sorting.RESULTSHere we report results for the first 12 patients who received Tregs of between 91% and 96% purity. Greater than grade II GVHD was noted in 2 patients in the first cohort of 5 patients, who received cryopreserved Tregs, but neither acute nor chronic GVHD was noted in the second cohort of 7 patients, who received fresh Tregs and single-agent GVHD prophylaxis. Patients in the second cohort appeared to have normal immune reconstitution compared with patients who underwent transplantation and did not develop GVHD.CONCLUSIONOur study shows that the use of highly purified fresh Tregs is clinically feasible and supports continued investigation of the strategy.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT01660607.FUNDINGNIH NHBLI R01 HL114591 and K08HL119590.", "Keywords": ["Bone marrow transplantation", "Cellular immune response", "Clinical Trials", "Transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tissue Donors", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Everett H", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ginna", "Last Name": "Laport", "Affiliation": "Tempest Therapeutics, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan J", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kate", "Last Name": "MacDonald", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kartoosh", "Last Name": "Heydari", "Affiliation": "Cell Therapy Facility, Stanford Health Care, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bita", "Last Name": "Sahaf", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sai-Wen", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeanette", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randall", "Last Name": "Armstrong", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keri", "Last Name": "Tate", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Cell and Gene Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Tadisco", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Cell and Gene Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Arai", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Lowsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Muffly", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Rezvani", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Shizuru", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen-Kai", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Sheehan", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Miklos", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Negrin", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019May16"}, {"PMID": "31024298", "Title": "Histamine and Delirium: Current Opinion.", "Abstract": "Delirium is a very common, but refractory clinical state, notably present in intensive care and in the growing aging community.

However, little is known of nonapoptotic functions of caspase-3 in most cell types. We have recently demonstrated a disassociation between caspase-3 activation and execution of apoptosis with accompanying cytoplasmic caspase-3 sequestration and preserved endothelial barrier function. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that nonapoptotic caspase-3 activation promotes endothelial barrier integrity. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to thrombin, a nonapoptotic stimulus, and endothelial barrier function was assessed using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and paracellular gap formation were assessed using phalloidin staining. Cell stiffness was evaluated using magnetic twisting cytometry. In addition, cell lysates were harvested for protein analyses. Caspase-3 was inhibited pharmacologically with pan-caspase and a caspase-3-specific inhibitor. Molecular inhibition of caspase-3 was achieved using RNA interference. Cells exposed to thrombin exhibited a cytoplasmic activation of caspase-3 with transient and nonapoptotic decrease in endothelial barrier function as measured by a drop in electrical resistance followed by a rapid recovery. Inhibition of caspases led to a more pronounced and rapid drop in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier function, accompanied by increased endothelial cell stiffness and paracellular gaps. Caspase-3-specific inhibition and caspase-3 knockdown both resulted in more pronounced thrombin-induced endothelial barrier disruption. Taken together, our results suggest cytoplasmic caspase-3 has nonapoptotic functions in human endothelium and can promote endothelial barrier integrity.", "Keywords": ["barrier function", "caspase-3", "cytoskeleton", "endothelium", "human lung microvascular endothelial cells", "nonapoptotic", "thrombin"], "MeSH terms": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Capillary Permeability", "Caspase 3", "Cells, Cultured", "Electric Impedance", "Endothelial Cells", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Humans", "Lung", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Thrombin", "Tight Junctions"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karthik", "Last Name": "Suresh", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen", "Last Name": "Carino", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Servinsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn E", "Last Name": "Machamer", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Todd M", "Last Name": "Kolb", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Steven M", "Last Name": "Dudek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago , Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Steven S", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Madhavi J", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Louisville , Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"First Name": "Larissa A", "Last Name": "Shimoda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Mahendra", "Last Name": "Damarla", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

In Drosophila, apoptotic elimination of the weaker \"loser\" cells from growing wing discs is induced by\u00a0a signaling module consisting of the Toll ligand Sp\u00e4tzle (Spz), several Toll-related receptors, and NF-\u03baB factors. How this module is activated and restricted to competing disc cells is unknown. Here, we use Myc-induced cell competition to demonstrate that loser cell elimination requires local wing disc synthesis of Spz. We identify Spz processing enzyme (SPE) and modular serine protease (ModSP) as activators of Spz-regulated competitive signaling and show that \"winner\" cells trigger elimination of nearby WT cells by boosting SPE production.

In a companion study we performed immunophenotypic analysis to determine the impact of ATLG on immune reconstitution (IR) and to correlate IR with clinical outcomes. The randomized study (n\u202f=\u202f254) included patients (aged 18 to 65 years) who underwent myeloablative transplants for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Ninety-one patients consented for the companion IR study (ATLG\u202f=\u202f44, placebo\u202f=\u202f47). Blood samples were collected on days 30, 100, 180, and 360 after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and multiparameter flow cytometry was performed in a blinded fashion. Reconstitution of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells was delayed up to 6 months post-HCT in the ATLG arm, whereas absolute regulatory T cell (Treg) (CD4+25+127-) numbers were lower only in the first 100 days. Analysis of the CD4+ Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv) (CD4+25-127+) compartments showed a profound absence of naive Tregs and Tconv in the first 100 days post-HCT, with very slow recovery for 1 year. B cell and natural killer cell recovery were similar in each arm. Higher absolute counts of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T, Tregs, and Tconv were associated with improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality but not moderate/severe cGVHD. Although ATLG delays CD3+ and CD4+ T cell recovery post-transplant, it has a relative Treg sparing effect after the early post-HCT period, with possible implications for protection from cGVHD.

Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the same receptors as imatinib but with different affinities. We tested the hypothesis that nilotinib is safe and has clinical activity in cGVHD. Thirty-three participants were enrolled in a phase I/II dose escalation and dose extension clinical trial of nilotinib for the treatment of steroid-refractory or- dependent cGVHD (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01155817). We assessed safety, clinical response, and pretreatment anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha chain (anti-PDGFRA) antibody levels. The 200-mg dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose and used for the phase II dose extension study. At 6 months the incidence of failure-free survival (FFS), cGVHD progression, and nilotinib intolerance resulting in its discontinuation was 50%, 23%, and 23%, respectively. cGVHD responses in skin, joints, and mouth were observed at 3 and 6 months based on improvement in respective National Institutes of Health organ severity scores. Pretreatment anti-PDGFRA antibody levels \u2265 .150 optical density as measured by ELISA correlated with longer FFS time (P\u2009<\u2009.0005) and trended with time until cGVHD progression (P\u2009<\u2009.06) but not drug intolerance. Nilotinib may be effective for corticosteroid-resistant or -refractory cGVHD in some patients, but its use is limited by intolerable side effects. Selection of patients with high pretreatment anti-PDGFRA antibody levels might improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of nilotinib and better justify its side effects.", "Keywords": ["Chronic graft-versus-host disease", "Clinical trial", "Nilotinib"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Selection", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pyrimidines", "Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George L", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Medicine/BMT Program and Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Raewyn", "Last Name": "Broady", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Leukemia BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Tara K", "Last Name": "Gregory", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology/Oncology, Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Laura J", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Barry E", "Last Name": "Storer", "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Jan H", "Last Name": "Beumer", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jingxin", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Medicine/BMT Program and Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kiara", "Last Name": "Cerda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Le", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Joanne M", "Last Name": "Otani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Buffalo Medical Group, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maureen A", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Medicine/BMT Program and Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Arai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Mary E D", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "McCarthy", "Affiliation": "Medicine/BMT Program and Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Miklos", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medicine/BMT Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.

We report a prospective, double-blind phase III trial to investigate the effect of ATLG (Neovii Biotech, Lexington, MA) on cGVHD-free survival. Patients and Methods Two hundred fifty-four patients 18 to 65 years of age with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were randomly assigned one to one to placebo (n =128 placebo) or ATLG (n = 126) treatment at 27 sites. Patients received either ATLG or placebo 20 mg/kg per day on days -3, -2, -1 in addition to tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The primary study end point was moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Results Despite a reduction in grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (23% v 40%; P = .004) and moderate-severe cGVHD (12% v 33%; P < .001) in ATLG recipients, no difference in moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival between ATLG and placebo was found (2-year estimate: 48% v 44%, respectively; P = .47). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower with ATLG (2-year estimate: 47% v 65% [ P = .04] and 59% v 74% [ P = .034], respectively). Multivariable analysis confirmed that ATLG was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.28; P = .026) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.71; P = .01). Conclusion In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of ATLG in unrelated myeloablative HCT, the incorporation of ATLG did not improve moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Moderate-severe cGVHD was significantly lower with ATLG, but PFS and OS also were lower. Additional analyses are needed to understand the appropriate role for ATLG in HCT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antilymphocyte Serum", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "HLA Antigens", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Middle Aged", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Prospective Studies", "Tacrolimus", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Soiffer", "Affiliation": "Robert J.

Activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing enzyme, is known to be elevated in nonsurvivors of sepsis compared to survivors. We have previously demonstrated that XOR is critical for ventilator-induced lung injury. Using febuxostat, a novel nonpurine inhibitor of XOR, we sought to determine the role of XOR inhibition in a murine model of sepsis-induced lung injury and mortality. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to intravenous (IV) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for various time points, and lungs were harvested for analyses. Subsets of mice were treated with febuxostat, pre or post LPS exposure, or vehicle. Separate groups of mice were followed up for mortality after LPS exposure. After 24\u00a0hr of IV LPS, mice exhibited an increase in XOR activity in lung tissue and a significant increase in pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption. Pretreatment of animals with febuxostat before exposure to LPS, or treatment 4\u00a0h after LPS, resulted in complete abrogation of XOR activity. Inhibition of XOR with febuxostat did not prevent LPS-induced pulmonary vascular permeability at 24\u00a0h, however, it accelerated recovery of the pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity in response to LPS exposure. Furthermore, treatment with febuxostat resulted in significant reduction in mortality. Inhibition of XOR with febuxostat accelerates recovery of the pulmonary endothelial barrier and prevents LPS-induced mortality, whether given before or after exposure to LPS.", "Keywords": ["Febuxostat", "lipopolysaccharide", "mortality", "organ dysfunction", "oxidative damage", "sepsis", "xanthine oxidoreductase"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endothelial Cells", "Febuxostat", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Lung Injury", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Sepsis", "Survival Analysis", "Xanthine Dehydrogenase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mahendra", "Last Name": "Damarla", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland mdamarl1@jhmi.edu."}, {"First Name": "Laura F", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Gigi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Lidenys", "Last Name": "Varela", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Todd M", "Last Name": "Kolb", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Bo S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Damico", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Hassoun", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}], "Journal": "Physiological reports", "PubDate": "2017Aug"}, {"PMID": "28727487", "Title": "Improving Care With a Portfolio of Physician-Led Cancer Quality Measures at an Academic Center.", "Abstract": "Development and implementation of robust reporting processes to systematically provide quality data to care teams in a timely manner is challenging.

We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the association between HCT-CI and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients receiving the total lymphoid irradiation and antithymocyte globulin (TLI/ATG) NMA transplantation preparative regimen. We abstracted demographic and clinical data from consecutive patients, who received allogeneic HCT with the TLI/ATG regimen between January 2008 and September 2014, from the Stanford blood and marrow transplantation database. We conducted univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the association between HCT-CI and NRM and ACM. In all, 287 patients were included for analysis. The median age of the patients was 61 (range, 22 to 77) years. The median overall survival was 844 (range, 374 to 1484) days. Most patients had Karnofsky performance score of 90 or above (85%). Fifty-two (18%) patients relapsed within 3 months and 108 (38%) patients relapsed within 1 year, with a median time to relapse of 163 (range, 83 to 366) days.

These cytokines have been strongly linked to the early events that occur during allergen exposures and how they contribute to the subsequent type 2 immune response. Of these three cytokines, IL-33 has proven particularly interesting because of the strong associations found between both it and its receptor, ST2, in several genome-wide association studies of allergic diseases. Further work has demonstrated clear mechanisms through which this cytokine might orchestrate allergic inflammation, including activation of several key effector cells that possess high ST2 levels, including mast cells, basophils, innate lymphoid cells, and eosinophils. Despite this, controversies surrounding IL-33 seem to suggest the biology of this cytokine might not be as simple as current dogmas suggest including: the relevant cellular sources of IL-33, with significant evidence for inducible expression in some hematopoietic cells; the mechanistic contributions of nuclear localization vs secretion; secretion and processing mechanisms; and the biological consequences of IL-33 exposure on different cell types. In this review, we will address the evidence for IL-33 and ST2 regulation over eosinophils and how this may contribute to allergic diseases. In particular, we focus on the accumulating evidence for a role of IL-33 in regulating hematopoiesis and how this relates to eosinophils as well as how this may provide new concepts for how the progression of allergy is regulated.", "Keywords": ["ST2/ST2L", "allergy and immunology", "asthma", "eosinophils", "interleukin 33", "stem cells"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura K", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Bryce", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in medicine", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28169564", "Title": "Demographics, lifestyle and veterinary care of cats in Australia and New Zealand.", "Abstract": "Objectives The aim of this survey was to provide up-to-date information on the demographics, lifestyle and veterinary care of cats in Australia and New Zealand. Methods An online survey consisting of 19 questions was created using SurveyMonkey. Cat owners were invited to participate through advertisements in veterinary clinics and social media. Results The average number of cats in a household was two. The majority of cats lived in free-standing houses (78%) in the suburbs (66%). The majority of cats were desexed (94% [49% female neutered; 45% male neutered]). A total of 57% of cats had been strays or came from an animal shelter. A total of 40% of owners had intended not to let the cats outside when they first acquired them. A total of 63% of cats were described as indoor-outdoor cats. Although owners described 34% of cats as 'indoor only', 58% of those cats had access to the outdoors. The majority of respondents' cats were vaccinated annually (63%) and visited a vet at least annually (79%). The most common reasons to take a cat to the vet were vaccinations or the cat being unwell. The most common reasons not to regularly take the cat to the vet were that the cat was never unwell, cost or stress for the cat.

Several studies have suggested that the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be ameliorated by increasing Tregs. We have developed an approach of in vivo expansion of Tregs with RGI-2001, a novel liposomal formulation of a synthetic derivative of alpha-galactosylceramide, a naturally occurring ligand that binds to CD1 and activates and expands invariant natural killer cells. In preclinical studies, a single intravenous infusion of RGI-2001 expanded Treg and could ameliorate GVHD in a mouse model of allogeneic HCT. To explore the role of RGI-2001 in clinical HCT, we initiated a phase 2A clinical trial (n\u2009=\u200929), testing 2 different doses of RGI-2001 administered as a single infusion on day 0 of allogeneic HCT. RGI-2001 was well tolerated and without infusion reactions or cytokine release syndrome. A subset of patients (8 of 29, 28%) responded to RGI-2001 by inducing a markedly increased number of cells with a Treg phenotype. The Treg had a high Ki-67 index and were almost exclusively Helios+ and Foxp3+, indicating that their accumulation was due to expansion of natural Treg. Notably, the incidence of grade 2 to 4 GVHD in the 8 patients who responded to RGI-2001 was 12.5%, compared with 52.4% in the 21 patients who did not respond. No grade 3 or 4 GVHD was observed in the responder group, compared with a 9.5% incidence among nonresponders.

Whereas IL-5 is crucial for supporting mature eosinophils (EoMs), the signals that support earlier eosinophil lineage events are less defined. The IL-33R, ST2, is expressed on several inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, and is best characterized for its role during the initiation of allergic responses in peripheral tissues. Recently, ST2 expression was described on hematopoietic progenitor subsets, where its function remains controversial. Our findings demonstrate that IL-33 is required for basal eosinophil homeostasis, because both IL-33- and ST2-deficient mice exhibited diminished peripheral blood eosinophil numbers at baseline. Exogenous IL-33 administration increased EoMs in both the bone marrow and the periphery in wild-type and IL-33-deficient, but not ST2-deficient, mice. Systemic IL-5 was also increased under this treatment, and blocking IL-5 with a neutralizing Ab ablated the IL-33-induced EoM expansion. The homeostatic hypereosinophilia seen in IL-5-transgenic mice was significantly lower with ST2 deficiency despite similar elevations in systemic IL-5. Finally, in vitro treatment of bone marrow cells with IL-33, but not IL-5, led to specific early expansion of IL-5R\u03b1-expressing precursor cells. In summary, our findings establish a basal defect in eosinophilopoiesis in IL-33- and ST2-deficient mice and a mechanism whereby IL-33 supports EoMs by driving both systemic IL-5 production and the expansion of IL-5R\u03b1-expressing precursor cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cells, Cultured", "Eosinophils", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hematopoiesis", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein", "Interleukin-33", "Interleukin-5", "Interleukin-5 Receptor alpha Subunit", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Neutrophils"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura K", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Lin", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Krier-Burris", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Krishan D", "Last Name": "Chhiba", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Karen B", "Last Name": "Chien", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "McKenzie", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 0QH, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Sergejs", "Last Name": "Berdnikovs", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Bryce", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60610; and p-bryce@northwestern.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2016Nov01"}, {"PMID": "27513368", "Title": "Lung Function Trajectory in Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant.", "Abstract": "The natural history of lung function in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is poorly characterized.

Lung tissue preparation for flow cytometry requires creation of a single-cell suspension, which often employs enzymatic and mechanical dissociation techniques. These practices may damage cells and cause cell death that is unrelated to the experimental conditions under study. We tested methods of lung tissue dissociation and sought to minimize cell death in the epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic lineage cellular compartments. A protocol that involved flushing the pulmonary circulation and inflating the lung with Dispase, a bacillus-derived neutral metalloprotease, at the time of tissue harvest followed by mincing, digestion in a DNase and collagenase solution, and filtration before staining with fluorescent reagents concurrently maximized viable yields of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic lineage cells compared with a standard method that did not use enzymes at the time of tissue harvest. Flow cytometry identified each population-epithelial (CD326(+)CD31(-)CD45(-)), endothelial (CD326(-)CD31(+)CD45(-)), and hematopoietic lineage (CD326(-)CD31(-)CD45(+))-and measured cellular viability by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. The Dispase method permitted discrimination of epithelial vs. endothelial cell death in a systemic lipopolysaccharide model of increased pulmonary vascular permeability. We conclude that application of a dissociative enzyme solution directly to the cellular compartments of interest at the time of tissue harvest maximized viable cellular yields of those compartments.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. LPS exposure induces the production of harmful reactive oxygen species, and the resultant oxidant injury has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both severe sepsis and ARDS. We previously showed that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib increases lung endothelial antioxidant enzymes and protects against pulmonary endothelial antioxidant injury. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that imatinib would protect against lung injury and systemic inflammation caused by intravenous LPS in an intact mouse model of endotoxemia mimicking early sepsis. We found that intravenous LPS induced a significant increase in the activity of lung xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme which is a major source of reactive oxygen species and implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Imatinib had no effect of LPS-induced XOR activity. However, pretreatment of mice with imatinib increased lung catalase activity and decreased intravenous LPS-induced lung oxidant injury as measured by \u03b3-H2AX, a marker of oxidant-induced DNA damage, lung apoptosis, and pulmonary edema. Imatinib also attenuated systemic cytokine expression after intravenous LPS exposure.

CS mediates pathologic emphysematous remodeling of the lung via apoptosis of lung parenchymal cells resulting in enlargement of the airspaces, loss of the capillary bed, and diminished surface area for gas exchange. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pleiotropic cytokine, is reduced both in a preclinical model of CS-induced emphysema and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly those with the most severe disease and emphysematous phenotype. MIF functions to antagonize CS-induced DNA damage, p53-dependent apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells (EndoCs) and resultant emphysematous tissue remodeling. Using primary alveolar EndoCs and a mouse model of CS-induced lung damage, we investigated the capacity and molecular mechanism(s) by which MIF modifies oxidant injury. Here, we demonstrate that both the activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), a superoxide-generating enzyme obligatory for CS-induced DNA damage and EndoC apoptosis, and superoxide concentrations are increased after CS exposure in the absence of MIF. Both XOR hyperactivation and apoptosis in the absence of MIF occurred via a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family member, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), was necessary for CS-induced p38 activation and EndoC apoptosis. MIF was sufficient to directly suppress ASK1 enzymatic activity.

The mechanistic definition of cell fitness is not understood, nor is it understood how fitness differences are recognized. Drosophila cells with extra Myc activity acquire \"supercompetitor\" status upon confrontation with wild-type (WT) cells, prompting the latter's elimination via apoptosis. Here we show that such confrontation enhances glycolytic flux in Myc cells and promotes their fitness and proliferation in a p53-dependent manner. Whereas p53 loss in noncompeting Myc cells is inconsequential, its loss impairs metabolism, reduces viability, and prevents the killing activity of Myc supercompetitor cells. We propose that p53 acts as a general sensor of competitive confrontation to enhance the fitness of the \"winner\" population. Our findings suggest that the initial confrontation between precancerous and WT cells could enhance cancer cell fitness and promote tumor progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Genomic Instability", "Glycolysis", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc", "RNA, Messenger", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "de la Cova", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nanami", "Last Name": "Senoo-Matsuda", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Life Science and Medical BioScience, School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, 2-2\u00a0Waskamatsu-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8480, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Marcello", "Last Name": "Ziosi", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Experimental Pathology, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy."}, {"First Name": "D Christine", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Bellosta", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catarina M", "Last Name": "Quinzii", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY\u00a010032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 701\u00a0West\u00a0168th\u00a0Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Animal studies have demonstrated that pathways regulating apoptosis are necessary in the development of acute lung injury, and that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is linked to the initiation of the apoptotic cascade. In this study, we assessed the role of the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 2, one of p38 MAPK's immediate downstream effectors, in the development of apoptosis in an animal model of LPS-induced pulmonary vascular permeability. Our results indicate that wild-type (WT) mice exposed to LPS demonstrate increased apoptosis, as evidenced by cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and increased deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling staining, which is accompanied by increases in markers of vascular permeability. In contrast, MK2(-/-) mice are protected from pulmonary vascular permeability and apoptosis in response to LPS. Although there was no difference in activation of caspase 3 in MK2(-/-) compared with WT mice, interestingly, cleaved caspase 3 translocated to the nucleus in WT mice while it remained in the cytosol of MK2(-/-) mice in response to LPS. In separate experiments, LPS-induced apoptosis in human lung microvascular endothelial cells was also associated with nuclear translocation of cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis, which were both prevented by MK2 silencing. In conclusion, our data suggest that MK2 plays a critical role in the development of apoptosis and pulmonary vascular permeability, and its effects on apoptosis are in part related to its ability to regulate nuclear translocation of cleaved caspase 3.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Capillary Permeability", "Caspase 3", "Cells, Cultured", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mahendra", "Last Name": "Damarla", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Ahmad R", "Last Name": "Parniani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasina", "Last Name": "Maredia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leonid", "Last Name": "Serebreni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Hamdan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Venkataramana K", "Last Name": "Sidhaye", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Larissa A", "Last Name": "Shimoda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Allen C", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Crow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric P", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carolyn E", "Last Name": "Machamer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Gaestel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Madhavi J", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd M", "Last Name": "Kolb", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bo S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Damico", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Hassoun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2014May"}, {"PMID": "23964118", "Title": "MMP28 promotes macrophage polarization toward M2 cells and augments pulmonary fibrosis.", "Abstract": "Members of the MMP family function in various processes of innate immunity, particularly in controlling important steps in leukocyte trafficking and activation. MMP28 (epilysin) is a member of this family of proteinases, and we have found that MMP28 is expressed by macrophages and regulates their recruitment to the lung. We hypothesized that MMP28 regulates other key macrophage responses, such as macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these MMP28-dependent changes in macrophage polarization would alter fibrotic responses in the lung. We examined the gene expression changes in WT and Mmp28-/- BMDMs, stimulated with LPS or IL-4/IL-13 to promote M1 and M2 cells, respectively. We also collected macrophages from the lungs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-exposed WT and Mmp28-/- mice to evaluate changes in macrophage polarization. Lastly, we evaluated the macrophage polarization phenotypes during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in WT and Mmp28-/- mice and assessed mice for differences in weight loss and total collagen levels. We found that MMP28 dampens proinflammatory macrophage function and promots M2 programming. In both in vivo models, we found deficits in M2 polarization in Mmp28-/- mice. In bleomycin-induced lung injury, these changes were associated with reduced fibrosis. MMP28 is an important regulator of macrophage polarization, promoting M2 function. Loss of MMP28 results in reduced M2 polarization and protection from bleomycin-induced fibrosis.

In response to intratracheal LPS, neutrophils migrate into the lung, and TGF-\u03b21 was suggested to protect against the ensuing injury. However, the mechanisms for this protective role remain unknown. Using a model of acute lung injury, we demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 decreases neutrophil numbers during the onset of injury. This was due to increased apoptosis rather than reduced migration. We demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 does not directly regulate neutrophil apoptosis but instead functions through IL-6 to promote neutrophil clearance. rIL-6 is sufficient to promote neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, while IL-6 increases rapidly following LPS-induced injury. Mast cells are a critical source of IL-6, because mast cell-deficient mice exhibit increased neutrophil numbers that are reduced by reconstitution with wild-type, but not IL-6(-/-), mast cells. Although IL-6 diminishes neutrophilia in mast cell-deficient mice, TGF-\u03b21 is ineffective, suggesting that these effects were mast cell dependent.
