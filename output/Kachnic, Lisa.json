This review describes different types of adaptive radiation therapy and their clinical implementation with a focus on CT-guided online adaptive radiation therapy. Depending on local anatomic changes and clinical context, different anatomic sites and/or disease stages and presentations benefit from different adaptation strategies. Online adaptive radiation therapy, where images acquired in-room before each fraction are used to adjust the treatment plan while the patient remains on the treatment table, has emerged to address unpredictable anatomic changes between treatment fractions. Online treatment adaptation places unique pressures on the radiation therapy workflow, requiring high-quality daily imaging and rapid recontouring, replanning, plan review, and quality assurance. Generating a new plan with every fraction is resource intensive and time sensitive, emphasizing the need for workflow efficiency and clinical resource allocation. Cone-beam CT is widely used for image-guided radiation therapy, so implementing cone-beam CT-guided online adaptive radiation therapy can be easily integrated into the radiation therapy workflow and potentially allow for rapid imaging and replanning. The major challenge of this approach is the reduced image quality due to poor resolution, scatter, and artifacts.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned coprimary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.The purpose of this update was to determine differences in patient-reported chronic toxicity and disease outcomes with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with conventional pelvic radiation. Patients with cervical and endometrial cancers who received postoperative pelvic radiation were randomly assigned to conventional radiation therapy (CRT) or IMRT. Toxicity and quality of life were assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) bowel and urinary domains, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Between 2012 and 2015, 279 eligible patients were enrolled to the study with a median follow-up of 37.8 months. There were no differences in overall survival (P = .53), disease-free survival (P = .21), or locoregional failure (P = .81). One year after RT, patients in the CRT arm experienced more high-level diarrhea frequency (5.8% IMRT v 15.1% CRT, P = .042) and a greater number had to take antidiarrheal medication two or more times a day (1.2% IMRT v 8.6% CRT, P = .036). At 3 years, women in the CRT arm reported a decline in urinary function, whereas the IMRT arm continued to improve (mean change in EPIC urinary score = 0.5, standard deviation = 13.0, IMRT v -6.0, standard deviation = 14.3, CRT, P = .005).

Most patients present with nonmetastatic disease and are curable with appropriate treatment, which has evolved significantly over the last several decades. Before the 1970s, SCCA was managed with radical surgery, resulting in a permanent colostomy. Researchers found that preoperative treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent radiation could achieve a pathologic complete response. After this observation, definitive therapy shifted from radical surgery to sphincter-preserving chemoradiation. Investigations into the necessity of chemotherapy and the optimal regimen found that chemotherapy with mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil is required for cure. Further studies evaluating the addition of induction or maintenance chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or higher radiation doses have demonstrated no significant benefit to disease control. Advanced radiation delivery with intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques is now considered the standard of care because of its prospectively determined, favorable acute toxicity profile compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiation. It is important to note that chemoradiation treatment response may be slow (up to 26 weeks) and should be assessed through serial clinical examinations. Today, surgical management of SCCA is reserved only for the lowest risk, early stage tumors or for recurrent/persistent disease. Current studies are evaluating radiation dose de-escalation in early stage disease and radiation dose escalation and the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors in locally advanced cancers. In reviewing how and why modern-day treatment of SCCA was established, the objective of this report is to reenforce adherence to current treatment paradigms to assure the best possible outcomes for patients.", "Keywords": ["anal cancer", "chemotherapy", "immunotherapy", "radiation", "surgery"], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Anus Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Fluorouracil", "Humans", "Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leila T", "Last Name": "Tchelebi", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Eng", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Oncology, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Messick", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Theodore S", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Ethan B", "Last Name": "Ludmir", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Lisa A", "Last Name": "Kachnic", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas G", "Last Name": "Zaorsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio."}], "Journal": "CA: a cancer journal for clinicians", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "34756496", "Title": "The association of age with acute toxicities in NRG oncology combined modality lower GI cancer trials.", "Abstract": "Expected toxicity from chemoradiation (CRT) is an important factor in treatment decisions but is poorly understood in older adults with lower gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies.

In addition to these currently recommended treatment paradigms, promising new strategies are available for treatment reduction. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone may allow for omission of RT in select patients with favorable LARC. For patients who have complete clinical responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RT, nonoperative management is being considered for sphincter preservation, with surgery used as salvage.

Methods Patients were randomly assigned to standard four-field radiation therapy (RT) or IMRT radiation treatment. The primary end point was change in patient-reported acute GI toxicity from baseline to the end of RT, measured with the bowel domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Secondary end points included change in patient-reported urinary toxicity, change in GI toxicity measured with the Patient-Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and quality of life measured with the Trial Outcome Index. Results From 2012 to 2015, 289 patients were enrolled, of whom 278 were eligible. Between baseline and end of RT, the mean EPIC bowel score declined 23.6 points in the standard RT group and 18.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .048), the mean EPIC urinary score declined 10.4 points in the standard RT group and 5.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .03), and the mean Trial Outcome Index score declined 12.8 points in the standard RT group and 8.8 points in the IMRT group ( P = .06). At the end of RT, 51.9% of women who received standard RT and 33.7% who received IMRT reported frequent or almost constant diarrhea ( P = .01), and more patients who received standard RT were taking antidiarrheal medications four or more times daily (20.4% v 7.8%; P = .04).

Participants in the 2017 Strategic Planning Workshop included leaders in cancer basic sciences, molecular theragnostics, pharmaceutical and technology industries, clinical trial design, oncology practice, and statistical analysis. The committee discussed high-priority research areas, such as optimization of combined modality therapy, radiation oncology-specific drug design, identification of molecular profiles predictive of radiation-induced local or distant tumor responses, and methods for normal tissue-specific mitigation of radiation toxicity. The following concepts emerged as dominant questions ready for national testing: (i) what is the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic, oligorecurrent, and oligoprogressive disease? (ii) How can combined modality therapy be used to enhance systemic and local response? (iii) Can we validate and optimize liquid biopsy and other biomarkers (such as novel imaging) to supplement current response criteria to guide therapy and clinical trial design endpoints? (iv) How can we overcome deficiencies of randomized survival endpoint trials in an era of increasing molecular stratification factors? And (v) how can we mitigate treatment-related side effects and maximize quality of life in cancer survivors? The committee concluded that many aspects of these questions are ready for clinical evaluation and example protocol concepts are provided that could improve rates of cancer cure and quality of survival.

Preoperative adjuvant chemoradiation treatment sequencing has allowed for decreased toxicity, more sphincter-sparing surgery, and improved local control rates as compared to delivering the chemoradiation postoperatively. Yet, given the heterogeneity of locally advanced disease, some patients may be over-treated with this approach, leading to unnecessary toxicity and costs, while others may have a propensity to develop distant metastases and may benefit from intensified therapy. Therefore, the trend in modern clinical trial design has been to individualize therapy.

Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided \u03b1, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed < 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 26%, and 4% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion HIV-associated SCCAC is potentially curable with definitive CRT. Although addition of cetuximab may result in less LRF, the 20% recurrence and 26% grade 4 toxicity rates indicate the continued need for more-effective and less-toxic therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Anus Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cetuximab", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Cisplatin", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Fluorouracil", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Sparano", "Affiliation": "Joseph A.

As part of NRG Oncology RTOG 0933, a phase II study of WBRT for brain metastases that conformally avoided the hippocampal stem cell compartment (HA-WBRT), memory was assessed pre- and post-HA-WBRT using both traditional and computerized memory tests. We examined whether the computerized tests yielded similar findings and might serve as possible alternatives for assessment of memory in multi-institution clinical trials. Adult patients with brain metastases received HA-WBRT to 30 Gy in ten fractions and completed Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), CogState International Shopping List Test (ISLT) and One Card Learning Test (OCLT), at baseline, 2 and 4 months. Tests' completion rates were 52-53 % at 2 months and 34-42 % at 4 months. All baseline correlations between HVLT-R and CogState tests were significant (p \u2264 0.003). At baseline, both CogState tests and one component of HVLT-R differentiated those who were alive at 6 months and those who had died (p \u2264 0.01). At 4 months, mean relative decline was 7.0 % for HVLT-R Delayed Recall and 18.0 % for ISLT Delayed Recall. OCLT showed an 8.0 % increase. A reliable change index found no significant changes from baseline to 2 and 4 months for ISLT Delayed Recall (z = -0.40, p = 0.34; z = -0.68, p = 0.25) or OCLT (z = 0.15, p = 0.56; z = 0.41, p = 0.66).

Data were extracted from the NCI SEER database that included population-based registries from 1988 to 2010 and analyzed using SPSS 20.0. 4,279 MBC patients were identified. 3,266 (76.3%) patients were White, 552 (12.9%) Black, 246 (5.7%) Hispanic, and 215 (5.0%) Asian.

When stratified by stage, there was no difference in receipt of primary treatment by race. The 5-year OS for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian races was 73.8%, 66.3%, 74.0%, and 85.3% (P < 0.001).

A prospective institutional review board-approved study included 26 patients undergoing breast RT: 20 whole breast irradiation (WBI) patients and six partial breast irradiation (PBI) patients, with surgical clips outlining the LC. The patients underwent CT simulation (CTsim) followed by five CBCTs during RT, once daily for PBI and once weekly for WBI. The distance between surgical clips and their centroid (D) acted as a surrogate for LC size. The RoC of the LC size, defined as the percentage change of D between two scans divided by the time interval in days between the scans, was calculated before (CTsim to CBCT1) and during RT (CBCT1 to CBCT5). The mean RoC of D for all patients before starting RT was -0.25%/day (range, -1.3 to 1.4) and for WBI patients during RT was -0.15%/day (range, -0.45 to 0.40). Stratified by median CTVLC, the RoC before RT for large CTVLC group (\u2265 25.7 cc) was 15 times higher (-0.47%/day) than for small CTVLC group (&lt; 25.7 cc) (-0.03%/day), p = 0.06. For patients undergoing CTsim &lt; 42 days from surgery, the RoC before RT was -0.43%/day compared to -0.07%/day for patients undergoing CTsim \u2265 42 days from surgery, p = 0.12. For breast cancer RT, the rate of change of the LC is affected by the initial cavity size and the timing from surgery.
