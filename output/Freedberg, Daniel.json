This study investigated predictors of failure to refer for HRM after an upper endoscopy that was performed for but did not explain dysphagia. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients >18 years of age who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for dysphagia from 2015 to 2021. Patients with EGD findings that explained dysphagia (e.g. esophageal mass, eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki ring, etc.) were excluded from the main analyses. The primary outcome was failure to refer for HRM within 1 year of the index non-diagnostic EGD. We also investigated delayed referral for HRM, defined as HRM performed after the median. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk factors that independently predicted failure to refer for HRM, conditioned on the providing endoscopist. Among 2132 patients who underwent EGD for dysphagia, 1240 (58.2%) did not have findings to explain dysphagia on the index EGD. Of these 1240 patients, 148 (11.9%) underwent HRM within 1 year of index EGD. Endoscopic findings (e.g. hiatal hernia, tortuous esophagus, Barrett's esophagus, surgically altered anatomy not involving the gastroesophageal junction, and esophageal varices) perceived to explain dysphagia were independently associated with failure to refer for HRM (adjusted odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.80). Of the 148 patients who underwent HRM within 1 year of index EGD, 29.7% were diagnosed with a disorder of esophagogastric junction outflow, 17.6% with a disorder of peristalsis, and 2.0% with both disorders of esophagogastric outflow and peristalsis. The diagnosis made by HRM was similar among those who had incidental EGD findings that were non-diagnostic for dysphagia compared with those who had completely normal EGD findings. Demographic factors including race/ethnicity, insurance type, and income were not associated with failure to refer for HRM or delayed HRM. Patients with dysphagia and endoscopic findings unrelated to dysphagia have a similar prevalence of esophageal motility disorders to those with normal endoscopic examinations, yet these patients are less likely to undergo HRM.

We aimed to assess the relationship between the salivary microbiome and neoplastic progression in BE to identify microbiome-related factors that may drive EAC development. We collected clinical data and oral health and hygiene history and characterized the salivary microbiome from 250 patients with and without BE, including 78 with advanced neoplasia (high grade dysplasia or early adenocarcinoma). We assessed differential relative abundance of taxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and associations between microbiome composition and clinical features and used microbiome metabolic modeling to predict metabolite production. We found significant shifts and increased dysbiosis associated with progression to advanced neoplasia, with these associations occurring independent of tooth loss, and the largest shifts were with the genus Streptococcus. Microbiome metabolic models predicted significant shifts in the metabolic capacities of the salivary microbiome in patients with advanced neoplasia, including increases in L-lactic acid and decreases in butyric acid and L-tryptophan production.

However, the relative risks associated with specific antibiotics may vary over time, and the absolute risks have not been clearly established. This is a retrospective cohort study. Adults were included if they received an outpatient antibiotic prescription within the IBM MarketScan databases between 2008 and 2020. The primary exposure was an outpatient antibiotic prescription, and the receipt of doxycycline was used as the reference comparison. The primary outcome was CA-CDI, defined as the presence of an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code for CDI within 90\u2009days of receiving an outpatient antibiotic prescription, and subsequent treatment for CDI. There were 36,626,794 unique patients who received outpatient antibiotics, including 11,607 (0.03%) who developed CA-CDI. Relative to doxycycline, the antibiotics conferring the highest risks for CA-CDI were clindamycin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.76 to 10.00), cefdinir (aOR, 5.86; 95% CI, 5.03 to 6.83), cefuroxime (aOR, 4.57; 95% CI, 3.87 to 5.39), and fluoroquinolones (aOR, 4.05; 95% CI, 3.58 to 4.59). Among older patients with CA-CDI risk factors, nitrofurantoin was also associated with CA-CDI (aOR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.92 to 4.84), with a smaller number needed to harm, compared to the fluoroquinolones. While clindamycin, cefuroxime, and fluoroquinolone use declined from 2008 to 2020, nitrofurantoin use increased by 40%. Clindamycin was associated with the greatest CA-CDI risk, overall.

Temporal Relationship between Patient and ICU Room Microbiome, and Influence on Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus Colonization.", "Abstract": "The gut microbiome of an individual can shape the local environmental surface microbiome. We sought to determine how the intensive care unit (ICU) patient gut microbiome shapes the ICU room surface microbiome, focusing on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), a common ICU pathogen. This was an ICU-based prospective cohort study. Rectal swabs were performed in adult ICU patients immediately at the time of ICU admission and environmental surface swabs were performed at five predetermined time points. All swabs underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culture for VRE. 304 ICU patients and 24 ICU rooms were sampled (5 longitudinal samples per ICU room). Spatially adjacent ICU rooms were no more microbially similar than nonadjacent rooms. Microbial signatures within rooms diverged rapidly over time: in 14\u2009days, ICU rooms were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their prior selves. This divergence over time was more pronounced in rooms with higher patient turnover. Examining VRE status by culture, patient VRE gut colonization had modest agreement with room surface VRE (kappa statistic 0.36). There were no ICU rooms that consistently cultured positive for VRE, including those that housed VRE positive patients. Individual ICU patients had a limited impact on ICU room surface microbiome, and rooms diverged similarly over time regardless of patients. Patient VRE gut colonization may have a modest influence on room surface VRE but there were no \"bad rooms\" that consistently cultured positive for VRE. These results may be useful in planning infection control measures. IMPORTANCE This study found that intensive care unit (ICU) room microbial signatures diverged from their baseline quickly: within 2 weeks, individual ICU rooms had lost distinguishing characteristics and were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their former selves. Patient turnover within rooms accelerated this drift. Patient gut colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) was associated with ICU room surface contamination with VRE; again, within 2 weeks, this association was substantially diminished. These results provide dynamic information regarding how patients control the microbiota on local hospital room surfaces and may facilitate decision making for infection prevention and control measures targeting VRE or other organisms.", "Keywords": ["gut microbiome", "healthcare-associated infections", "intensive care unit", "vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cross Infection", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Vancomycin", "Vancomycin Resistance", "Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Freedberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miles", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Nattakom", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacky", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elissa", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Zachariah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2022Feb23"}, {"PMID": "35093158", "Title": "Obesity is not associated with adverse outcomes among hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection.", "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with increased risk for death in most infections but has not been studied as a risk factor for mortality in Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).

COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4\u2009weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae.

In this observational study, faecal microbiome composition data obtained from 16S rDNA sequencing of 90 cirrhotic patients with and without long-term PPI use and additional potential biomarkers identified from the literature were evaluated for their predictive value regarding PPI-associated dysbiosis and liver-related three-year mortality. In addition, faecal calprotectin, faecal zonulin and serum lipopolysaccharides were assessed as markers for intestinal inflammation, gut permeability and bacterial translocation.

Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic immune response to disseminated infection that has a high mortality rate. In some patients, sepsis results in a period of immunosuppression (known as 'immunoparalysis')1 characterized by reduced inflammatory cytokine output2, increased secondary infection3 and an increased risk of organ failure and mortality4. Lipopolysaccharide tolerance recapitulates several key features of sepsis-associated immunosuppression5. Although various epigenetic changes have previously been observed in tolerized macrophages6-8, the molecular basis of tolerance, immunoparalysis and other forms of innate immune memory has remained unclear. Here we perform a screen for tolerance-associated microRNAs and identify miR-221 and miR-222 as regulators of the functional reprogramming of macrophages during lipopolysaccharide tolerization. Prolonged stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in mice leads to increased expression of miR-221 and mir-222, both of which regulate brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1, also known as Smarca4). This increased expression causes the transcriptional silencing of a subset of inflammatory genes that depend on chromatin remodelling mediated by SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which in turn promotes tolerance.
