This framework is rooted in behavioral ecology and has traditionally been used to study maladaptive versus adaptive non-human animal foraging behavior. Researchers have begun to recognize the potential utility of understanding human decision-making and psychopathology through the explore/exploit trade-off. In this article, we propose that explore/exploit trade-off holds promise for advancing our mechanistic understanding of decision-making processes that confer vulnerability for and maintain eating pathology due to its neurodevelopmental bases, conservation across species, and ability to be mathematically modeled. We present a model for how suboptimal explore/exploit decision-making can promote disordered eating and present recommendations for future research applying this framework to eating pathology. Taken together, the explore/exploit trade-off provides a translational framework for expanding etiologic and maintenance models of eating pathology, given developmental changes in explore/exploit decision-making that coincide in time with the emergence of eating pathology and evidence of biased explore/exploit decision-making in psychopathology. Additionally, understanding explore/exploit decision-making in eating disorders may improve knowledge of their underlying pathophysiology, informing targeted clinical interventions such as neuromodulation and pharmacotherapy. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The explore/exploit trade-off is a cross-species decision-making process whereby organisms choose between a known option with a known reward or sampling unfamiliar options. We hypothesize that imbalanced explore/exploit decision-making can promote disordered eating and present preliminary data.

Genetic susceptibility and increased availability of energy-dense food are known risk factors for obesity. However, the extent to which these factors jointly bias behavior and neural circuitry towards increased adiposity in children remains unclear. While undergoing fMRI, 108 children (ages 5-11y) performed a food-specific go/no-go task. Participants were instructed to either respond (\"go\") or inhibit responding (\"no-go\") to images of food or toys. Half of the runs depicted high-calorie foods (e.g., pizza) whereas the other half depicted low-calorie foods (e.g., salad). Children were also genotyped for a DNA polymorphism associated with energy intake and obesity (FTO rs9939609) to examine the influence of obesity risk on behavioral and brain responses to food. Participants demonstrated differences in behavioral sensitivity to high- and low-calorie food images depending on task demands. Participants were slower but more accurate at detecting high- (relative to low-) calorie foods when responding to a neutral stimulus (i.e., toys) and worse at detecting toys when responding to high-calorie foods. Inhibition failures were accompanied by salience network activity (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), which was driven by false alarms to food images. Children at a greater genetic risk for obesity (dose-dependent model of the FTO genotype) demonstrated pronounced brain and behavioral relationships such that genetic risk was associated with heightened sensitivity to high-calorie food images and increased anterior insula activity. These findings suggest that high-calorie foods may be particularly salient to children at risk for developing eating habits that promote obesity.", "Keywords": ["Food cues", "Go/no-go", "Obesity risk", "Salience network", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Child", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Cues", "Obesity", "Feeding Behavior", "Neuroimaging", "Food", "Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kristina M", "Last Name": "Rapuano", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. kristina.rapuano@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Link", "Last Name": "Tejavibulya", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eda Naz", "Last Name": "Dinc", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anfei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haley", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Korn", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "B Timothy", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Ranzenhofer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "B J", "Last Name": "Casey", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Yale University, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laurel", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain imaging and behavior", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "36584139", "Title": "Eating behavior in atypical anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "Atypical anorexia nervosa (AN) has been increasingly identified in the community and in clinical settings.

These attributes are used differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health attributes in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy women and women with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of tastiness and healthiness could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups.

To enhance rigor and reproducibility in task-based research, it is advantageous to have stimulus sets that are publicly available and well characterized. Food Folio by Columbia Center for Eating Disorders is a publicly available set of 138 images of Western food items. The set was developed for the study of eating disorders, particularly for use in tasks that capture eating behavior characteristic of these illnesses. It contains foods that are typically eaten, as well as those typically avoided, by individuals with eating disorders. Each image has now been rated across 17 different attributes by a large general United States population sample via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (n = 1054). Ratings included subjective attributes (e.g., tastiness, healthiness, and favorable texture) as well as estimates of nutrient content (e.g., fat and carbohydrate). Each participant rated a subset of stimulus set food items (46 foods) on all 17 dimensions. Additional description of the image set is provided in terms of physical image information and accurate nutritional information. Correlations between subjective ratings were calculated and an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory cluster analysis completed. Outcomes of the factor analysis suggested foods may be described along three latent factors of healthiness, tastiness, and umami taste; the cluster analysis highlighted five distinct clusters of foods varying on these same dimensions. Descriptive outcomes indicated that the stimulus set includes a range of foods that vary along multiple dimensions and thus is likely to be useful in addressing various research questions surrounding eating behavior and cognition in healthy populations, as well as in those with eating disorders.

These psychological categories have been further identified with formal computational algorithms, model-based and model-free learning, which helps to provide quantitative tools to distinguish them. Computational psychiatry may be particularly useful for examining phenomena in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), whose self-starvation appears both excessively goal directed and habitual. However, these laboratory-based studies have not aimed to examine complex behavior, as seen outside the laboratory, in contexts that extend beyond monetary rewards. We therefore assessed (1) whether behavior in AN was characterized by enhanced or diminished model-based behavior, (2) the domain specificity of any abnormalities by comparing learning in a food-specific (i.e., illness-relevant) context as well as in a monetary context, and (3) whether impairments were secondary to starvation by comparing learning before and after initial treatment. Across all conditions, individuals with AN, relative to healthy controls, showed an impairment in model-based, but not model-free, learning, suggesting a general and persistent contribution of habitual over goal-directed control, across domains and time points. Thus, eating behavior in individuals with AN that appears very goal-directed may be under more habitual than goal-directed control, and this is not remediated by achieving weight restoration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Goals", "Humans", "Learning", "Motivation", "Reward"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karin", "Last Name": "Foerde", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel D", "Last Name": "Daw", "Affiliation": "Princeton University."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Rufin", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "B Timothy", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Daphna", "Last Name": "Shohamy", "Affiliation": "Kavli Institute for Brain Science."}, {"First Name": "Joanna E", "Last Name": "Steinglass", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}], "Journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33185933", "Title": "The association between leptin and weight maintenance outcome in anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "Relapse after weight restoration in anorexia nervosa (AN) is a critical problem.

Fifty-nine youth with clinically significant AN symptom constellations, but who never met full Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) (DSM-IV) criteria for AN, were enrolled in a partially randomized preference design study. Participants were offered randomization to FBT or supportive psychotherapy (SPT); those who declined to be randomized because of a strong treatment preference were entered into a parallel, non-randomized self-selected intervention study. Without accessing outcome data, an observational analysis with three diagnostic subclasses was designed based on AN symptom severity profiles, combining randomized and non-randomized participants, such that participants receiving FBT and SPT within each subclass were similar on key baseline characteristics. Outcomes of this pilot study were explored by calculating effect sizes for end-of-treatment values within each subclass, and also with a longitudinal mixed effect model that accounted for subclass. Weight trajectory was measured by percent expected body weight. Psychological outcomes were fear of weight gain, feeling fat, importance of weight, and importance of shape. Results show that the pattern of symptom observations over time was dependent on subclass of SAN (least symptomatic, moderately symptomatic, or most symptomatic) and on the target outcome variable category (weight or psychological). Results from this study, which should be considered in the context of the small sample sizes overall and within groups, can generate hypotheses for future, larger research trials on early treatment strategies.

restricted fat intake among low-weight patients. The Geiselman Food Preference Questionnaire-I\u00a9 (FPQ) is a validated self-report measure that yields a fat preference score (FPS). Prior research reported that patients with AN had a significantly lower FPS than did healthy control (HC) participants. The goal of the current study was to compare self-reported fat preference (FPS) to fat intake (multi-item meal (MIM) study) in low-weight ANs and HCs. Specific aims were 1) to determine if the FPS differed between ANs and HCs; 2) to determine if fat and energy intakes differed between ANs and HCs; and 3) to determine if the FPS was associated with fat and energy intakes in ANs and HCs. Forty-four female AN inpatients and 48 female HCs completed the FPQ and participated in a MIM study. Compared to HCs, ANs consumed less energy (469.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f397.7 vs. 856.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f346.8\u202fkcal, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), less fat (16.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.4 vs. 36.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f18.9\u202fg, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and a smaller percentage of calories from fat (22.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.8 vs. 36.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.0%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) at the MIM.

Computer-based paradigms that measure responses to images of foods are potentially useful tools for assessing food attitudes and characteristics of eating behavior. In particular, food choice tasks attempt to directly probe aspects of individuals' decisions about what to eat. In the Food Choice Task participants rate the healthiness and tastiness of a variety of food items presented one at a time. Next, participants choose for each food item whether they prefer to eat the item vs. a neutrally rated reference food item. The goal of the current study was to assess the stability and reliability of this Food Choice Task over time and with repeated testing. Secondary analyses were conducted using data from healthy volunteers in two separate studies that administered the task at two time points, separated either by several days or about a month. The overall reliability of the Food Choice Task across multiple administrations was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients and the reliability of ratings of individual food items was assessed using kappa coefficients. The results indicated that test-retest reliability of the Food Choice Task in healthy volunteers was high at both shorter and longer test-retest intervals. In addition, the reliability of individual food item ratings was good for a majority of items. The proportion of healthy volunteers' high-fat food choices did not change over time in either of the two studies. Thus, the Food Choice Task is suitable for measuring food choices in studies with multiple assessment points.

Some individuals consume large amounts of non-caloric artificial sweeteners, suggesting abnormalities in appetitive responding. The current study aimed to quantify hedonic and motivating effects of artificial sweetener in individuals with and without an eating disorder. Two laboratory studies were conducted. Hedonic preference was estimated using the number of artificial sweetener packets (0-10) added to unsweetened cherry flavored Kool-Aid (study 1). Motivation to obtain sweetener was assessed by a progressive ratio (PR) work task (study 2). Ninety-three participants (25 anorexia nervosa restricting type (AN-R), 23 AN binge/purge type (AN-B/P), 20 bulimia nervosa (BN), and 25 normal controls (NC)) completed the study. No significant difference in hedonic preference was found among participant groups. Work completed at the PR task ranged from 0 to 9500 key-board presses. The AN-B/P group had a significantly higher breakpoint and performed significantly more work for sweetener compared to the BN and NC groups. Among AN-B/P and AN-R participants, the preferred number of Equal packets was significantly correlated with the breakpoint and total work. The increased amount of work for sweetener among individuals with AN-B/P supports an enhanced reward value of sweet taste in this population, and suggests that the characteristic food avoidance in AN cannot be accounted for by decreased reward value of all taste-related stimuli.

In Study 1, 23 women with AN (restrictive and binge/purge subtypes), and 18 healthy controls (HC) completed the slips-of-action paradigm, designed to assess reward-based habits. In Study 2, 13 women with restrictive AN, 14 women recovered from restrictive AN, and 17 female HC participants completed the slips-of-action paradigm, and an avoidance paradigm, designed to assess aversive habits. AN participants showed no deficit relative to HCs in the ability to use feedback to respond correctly to stimuli. Following devaluation of outcomes, all groups in both studies were equally able to withhold inappropriate responses, suggesting no deficit in the balance between goal-directed and habitual control of behaviour in these tasks in AN.

The development of behavioral measures that use disease-relevant stimuli can greatly improve our understanding of cue-specific impairments in self-control. To produce such a tool relevant to the study of eating and weight disorders, we modified the traditional go/no-go task to include food and non-food targets. To confirm that performance on this new task was consistent with other go/no-go tasks, it was given to 147 healthy, normal weight volunteers between the ages of 5 and 30. High-resolution photos of food or toys were used as the target and nontarget stimuli. Consistent with expectations, overall improvements in accuracy were seen from childhood to adulthood. Participants responded more quickly and made more commission errors to food cues compared to nonfood cues (F(1,140)=21.76, P<0.001), although no behavioral differences were seen between low- and high-calorie food cues for this non-obese, healthy developmental sample.

This study compared the effectiveness of self-help cognitive-behavioral therapy (shCBT) and an anti-obesity medication (sibutramine), alone and in combination, and it is only the second placebo-controlled trial of any medication for BED to evaluate longer-term effects after treatment discontinuation. 104 obese patients with BED (73% female, 55% non-white) were randomly assigned to one of four 16-week treatments (balanced 2-by-2 factorial design): sibutramine (N\u00a0= 26), placebo (N = 27), shCBT + sibutramine (N = 26), or shCBT + placebo (N = 25). Medications were administered in double-blind fashion. Independent assessments were performed monthly throughout treatment, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups (16 months after randomization). Mixed-models analyses revealed significant time and medication-by-time interaction effects for percent weight loss, with sibutramine but not placebo associated with significant change over time. Percent weight loss differed significantly between sibutramine and placebo by the third month of treatment and at post-treatment. After the medication was discontinued at post-treatment, weight re-gain occurred in sibutramine groups and percent weight loss no longer differed among the four treatments at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. For binge-eating, mixed-models revealed significant time and shCBT-by-time interaction effects: shCBT had significantly lower binge-eating frequency at 6-month follow-up but the treatments did not differ significantly at any other time point. Demographic factors did not significantly predict or moderate clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that pure self-help CBT and sibutramine did not show long-term effectiveness relative to placebo for treating BED in racially/ethnically diverse obese patients in primary care. Overall, the treatments differed little with respect to binge-eating and associated outcomes. Sibutramine was associated with significantly greater acute weight loss than placebo and the observed weight-regain following discontinuation of medication suggests that anti-obesity medications need to be continued for weight loss maintenance.

Crucially, studies investigating components of different eating behaviors have documented that Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) are characterized by objective disturbances in eating patterns that are significantly different than behaviors exhibited by individuals who do not have these eating disorders. The detailed description of the disturbances in eating behavior has helped to identify diagnostic criteria associated with each disorder, and has led to important hypotheses about the underlying pathophysiology. These advances in understanding have provided, and continue to provide, a foundation for translational research and for the development of novel treatment interventions.

Enhanced reinforcing value of food may play a role in this behavioral disturbance, but a systematic behavioral assessment of objective measures of the rewarding value of binge eating is lacking. The purpose of this study was to quantify the reinforcing value of food in BN patients as compared with normal controls. A progressive ratio (PR) computerized work task was completed under binge and non-binge instruction. The task consisted of 12 trials. The first trial required 50 keyboard taps to earn one portion of yogurt shake, and subsequent trials required progressive work increments of 200 taps for each additional portion. Completion of all 12 trials required 13,800 taps to earn 2100ml of shake. The breakpoint, defined as the largest ratio completed before a participant stopped working, was the measure of reinforcing efficacy. Ten patients and 10 controls completed the experiment. Under binge instruction, patients completed more trials and taps, and had a higher breakpoint than controls. The non-binge instruction yielded opposite findings; compared to controls, patients completed fewer trials and taps, and had a lower breakpoint. These results support the feasibility and potential utility of a PR task to quantify the reinforcing value of food in patients with BN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Binge-Eating Disorder", "Bulimia", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Diet", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Reward", "Work", "Yogurt", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Schebendach", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 98, New York, NY 10032, USA. js2202@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Allegra", "Last Name": "Broft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard W", "Last Name": "Foltin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "B Timothy", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Appetite", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "22981561", "Title": "Activity-based anorexia is associated with reduced hippocampal cell proliferation in adolescent female rats.", "Abstract": "Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model of anorexia nervosa that mimics core features of the clinical psychiatric disorder, including severe food restriction, weight loss, and hyperactivity. The ABA model is currently being used to study starvation-induced changes in the brain. Here, we examined hippocampal cell proliferation in animals with ABA (or the appropriate control conditions). Adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 4 groups: control (24h/day food access), food-restricted (1h/day food access), exercise (24h/day food and wheel access), and ABA (1h/day food access, 24h/day wheel access). After 3 days of ABA, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 200mg/kg, i.p.) was injected and the rats were perfused 2h later. Brains were removed and subsequently processed for BrdU and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. The acute induction of ABA reduced cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. This effect was significant in the hilus region of the dentate gyrus, but not in the subgranular zone, where adult neurogenesis occurs. Marked decreases in cell proliferation were also observed in the surrounding dorsal hippocampus and in the corpus callosum. These results indicate a primary effect on gliogenesis rather than neurogenesis following 3 days of ABA. For each brain region studied (except SGZ), there was a strong positive correlation between the level of cell proliferation and body weight/food intake. Future studies should examine whether these changes are maintained following long-term weight restoration and whether alterations in neurogenesis occur following longer exposures to ABA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Anorexia", "Antimetabolites", "Behavior, Animal", "Body Weight", "Bromodeoxyuridine", "Caloric Restriction", "Cell Proliferation", "Corpus Callosum", "Eating", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Immunohistochemistry", "Ki-67 Antigen", "Motor Activity", "Neurogenesis", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole C", "Last Name": "Barbarich-Marsteller", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 98, New York, NY 10032, United States; New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 98, New York, NY 10032, United States.
