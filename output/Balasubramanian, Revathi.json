[{"PMID": "37886565", "Title": "FYN regulates aqueous humor outflow and IOP through the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin.", "Abstract": "The exact sites and molecules that determine resistance to aqueous humor drainage and control intraocular pressure (IOP) need further elaboration. Proposed sites include the inner wall of Schlemms's canal and the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork ocular drainage tissues. The adherens junctions (AJs) of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells (SECs) must both preserve the blood-aqueous humor (AQH) barrier and be conducive to AQH drainage. How homeostatic control of AJ permeability in SC occurs and how such control impacts IOP is unclear. We hypothesized that mechano-responsive phosphorylation of the junctional molecule VE-CADHERIN (VEC) by SRC family kinases (SFKs) regulates the permeability of SEC AJs. We tested this by clamping IOP at either 16 mmHg, 25 mmHg, or 45 mmHg in mice and then measuring AJ permeability and VEC phosphorylation. We found that with increasing IOP: 1) SEC AJ permeability increased, 2) VEC phosphorylation was increased at tyrosine-658, and 3) SFKs were activated at the AJ. Among the two SFKs known to phosphorylate VEC, FYN, but not SRC, localizes to the SC. Furthermore, FYN mutant mice had decreased phosphorylation of VEC at SEC AJs, dysregulated IOP, and reduced AQH outflow. Together, our data demonstrate that increased IOP activates FYN in the inner wall of SC, leading to increased phosphorylation of AJ VEC and, thus, decreased resistance to AQH outflow. These findings support a crucial role of mechanotransduction signaling in IOP homeostasis within SC in response to IOP. These data strongly suggest that the inner wall of SC partially contributes to outflow resistance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krishnakumar", "Last Name": "Kizhatil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Graham", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Sunderland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aakriti", "Last Name": "Bhandari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Logan", "Last Name": "Horbal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Revathi", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "John", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Sep04"}, {"PMID": "37886472", "Title": "Transcriptomic profiling of Schlemm's canal cells reveals a lymphatic-biased identity and three major cell states.", "Abstract": "Schlemm's canal (SC) is central in intraocular pressure regulation but requires much characterization. It has distinct inner and outer walls, each composed of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells (SECs) with different morphologies and functions. Recent transcriptomic studies of the anterior segment added important knowledge, but were limited in power by SEC numbers or did not focus on SC. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of SC biology, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on C57BL/6J SC, blood vessel, and lymphatic endothelial cells from limbal tissue (~4500 SECs). We also analyzed mouse limbal tissues by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (C57BL/6J and 129/Sj strains), successfully sequencing 903 individual SECs. Together, these datasets confirm that SC has molecular characteristics of both blood and lymphatic endothelia with a lymphatic phenotype predominating. SECs are enriched in pathways that regulate cell-cell junction formation pointing to the importance of junctions in determining SC fluid permeability. Importantly, and for the first time, our analyses characterize 3 molecular classes of SECs, molecularly distinguishing inner wall from outer wall SECs and discovering two inner wall cell states that likely result from local environmental differences. Further, and based on ligand and receptor expression patterns, we document key interactions between SECs and cells of the adjacent trabecular meshwork (TM) drainage tissue.

Various subtypes of amacrine interneurons mediate a vast majority of image forming and non-image forming visual functions. The transcriptional regulation governing the development of individual amacrine cell subtypes is not well understood. One such amacrine cell subtype comprises neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS/bNOS/NOS1)-expressing amacrine cells (NOACs) that regulate the release of nitric oxide (NO), a neurotransmitter with physiological and clinical implications in the retina. We have identified the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor LHX9 to be necessary for the genesis of NOACs. During retinal development, NOACs express Lhx9, and Lhx9-null retinas lack NOACs. Lhx9-null retinas also display aberrations in dendritic stratification at the inner plexiform layer. Our cell lineage-tracing studies show that Lhx9-expressing cells give rise to both the GAD65 and GAD67 expressing sub-populations of GABAergic amacrine cells. As development proceeds, Lhx9 is downregulated in the GAD65 sub-population of GABAergic cells and is largely restricted to the GAD67 sub-population of amacrine cells that NOACs are a part of. Taken together, we have uncovered Lhx9 as a new molecular marker that defines a subset of amacrine cells and show that it is necessary for the development of the NOAC subtype of amacrine cells.", "Keywords": ["Amacrine cell subtype", "LIM-homeodomain transcription factor", "Retina", "Retinal lamination"], "MeSH terms": ["Amacrine Cells", "Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Dendrites", "GABAergic Neurons", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Mice", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Retinal Neurons", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Revathi", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Bui", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuhui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Institute of Life Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310036, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Gan", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA. lin_gan@urmc.rochester.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "27349434", "Title": "Barhl2 Determines the Early Patterning of the Diencephalon by Regulating Shh.", "Abstract": "The diencephalon is the primary relay network transmitting sensory information to the anterior forebrain. During development, distinct progenitor domains in the diencephalon give rise to the pretectum (p1), the thalamus and epithalamus (p2), and the prethalamus (p3), respectively. Shh plays a significant role in establishing the progenitor domains. However, the upstream events influencing the expression of Shh are largely unknown. Here, we show that Barhl2 homeobox gene is expressed in the p1 and p2 progenitor domains and the in zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) and regulates the acquisition of identity of progenitor cells in the developing diencephalon. Targeted deletion of Barhl2 results in the ablation of Shh expression in the dorsal portion of ZLI and causes thalamic p2 progenitors to take the fate of p1 progenitors and form pretectal neurons. Moreover, loss of Barhl2 leads to the absence of thalamocortical axon projections, the loss of habenular afferents and efferents, and a gross diminution of the pineal gland. Thus, by acting upstream of Shh signaling pathway, Barhl2 plays a crucial role in patterning the progenitor domains and establishing the positional identities of progenitor cells in the diencephalon.", "Keywords": ["Barhl2", "Diencephalon", "Patterning", "Shh", "Thalamus", "Transcription factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Biomarkers", "Body Patterning", "Cerebral Cortex", "Diencephalon", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Thalamus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Revathi", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongwang", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Institute of Life Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, 310036, China."}, {"First Name": "Guoqing", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Life Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, 310036, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Gan", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642, USA. lin_gan@urmc.rochester.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "PubDate": "2017Aug"}, {"PMID": "26454099", "Title": "Mechanisms of FGF gradient formation during embryogenesis.", "Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have long been attributed to influence morphogenesis in embryonic development.
