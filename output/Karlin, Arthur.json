[{"PMID": "38227371", "Title": "A membrane-associated phosphoswitch in Rad controls adrenergic regulation of cardiac calcium channels.", "Abstract": "The ability to fight or flee from a threat relies on an acute adrenergic surge that augments cardiac output, which is dependent on increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. This cardiac response depends on \u03b2-adrenergic-initiated reversal of the small RGK G protein Rad-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) acting through the Cav\u03b2 subunit. Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution. Thus, dissociation of Rad from the sarcolemma, and consequently from CaV\u03b2, is sufficient for sympathetic upregulation of Ca2+ currents.", "Keywords": ["Calcium channels", "Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Excitation contraction coupling"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adrenergic Agents", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Papa", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Pedro J", "Last Name": "Del Rivero Morfin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Bohnen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Vivian", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Moshe", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Suraj", "Last Name": "Subramaniam", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Joel A", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "Dascal", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Karlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2024Jan16"}, {"PMID": "36424916", "Title": "Rad regulation of CaV1.2 channels controls cardiac fight-or-flight response.", "Abstract": "Fight-or-flight responses involve \u03b2-adrenergic-induced increases in heart rate and contractile force. In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice.

The values of membrane potential (Vm) and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration (Ca(in)) within minutes of a change in pressure are the results of two opposing pathways, both of which use Ca(2+) as a signal. This works because the two Ca(2+)-signaling pathways are confined to distinct microdomains in which the Ca(2+) concentrations needed to activate key channels are transiently higher than Ca(in). A mathematical model of an isolated arterial SM cell is presented that incorporates the two types of microdomains. The first type consists of junctions between cisternae of the peripheral sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), containing ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and the sarcolemma, containing voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels. These junctional microdomains promote hyperpolarization, reduced Ca(in), and relaxation. The second type is postulated to form around stretch-activated nonspecific cation channels and neighboring Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels, and promotes the opposite (depolarization, increased Ca(in), and contraction). The model includes three additional compartments: the sarcoplasm, the central SR lumen, and the peripheral SR lumen. It incorporates 37 protein components. In addition to pressure, the model accommodates inputs of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, ATP, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, and nitric oxide (NO). The parameters of the equations were adjusted to obtain a close fit to reported Vm and Ca(in) as functions of pressure, which have been determined in cerebral arteries. The simulations were insensitive to \u00b1 10% changes in most of the parameters. The model also simulated the effects of inhibiting RyR, BK, or voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels on Vm and Ca(in). Deletion of BK \u03b21 subunits is known to increase arterial-SM tension.

The \u03b21 subunit is expressed in smooth muscle, where it slows BK channel kinetics and shifts the conductance-voltage (G-V) curve to the left at [Ca(2+)] > 2 \u00b5M. In addition to the six transmembrane (TM) helices, S1-S6, conserved in all voltage-dependent K(+) channels, BK \u03b1 has a unique seventh TM helix, S0, which may contribute to the unusual rightward shift in the G-V curve of BK \u03b1 in the absence of \u03b21 and to a leftward shift in its presence. Such a role is supported by the close proximity of S0 to S3 and S4 in the voltage-sensing domain.

One such pair, W22C in S0 and W203C in S4, was 95% crosslinked endogenously.

In addition, 90% crosslinking of a second pair, R20C in S0 and W203C in S4, had no effect on the V50 for opening.

Based on endogenous disulfide formation between engineered cysteines (Cys), we found that in \u03b22 and \u03b23, as in \u03b21 and \u03b24, TM1 is closest to \u03b1S1 and \u03b1S2 and TM2 is closest to \u03b1S0.
