In the preterm eye, the retina is not fully developed and neovascularization may occur at the margin between the developed vascular retina and undeveloped avascular retina. Without timely treatment by laser or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, this can lead to tractional retinal detachment and blindness. Visualization of the retina in regular examinations by indirect ophthalmoscopy is hence the current standard of care, but the exams are stressful and interpretation of images is subjective. The upregulation of VEGF in ROP would suggest an increase in ocular blood flow. In this report, we evaluate the potential of ultrafast plane-wave Doppler ultrasound (PWU) to detect increased flow velocities in the orbital vessels supplying the eye in a gentle exam with objective findings. We imaged both eyes of 50 low-birthweight preterm neonates using 18\u00a0MHz PWU. Flow velocity in the central retinal artery (CRA) and vein (CRV), and the short posterior ciliary arteries were determined and values at each ROP Stage compared. We found significantly increased velocities in the CRA and CRV in Stage 3 ROP eyes, where intervention would be considered. We compared multivariate models for identifying Stage 3 eyes comprised solely of clinical factors, solely of Doppler parameters, and clinical plus Doppler parameters. The respective models provided areas under their respective ROC curves of 0.760, 0.812, and 0.904.

There are two primary commercially available systems that deliver ciNPT through different mechanisms. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the potential effects of two different ciNPT systems on clinical outcomes following hip and knee arthroplasty. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify hip and knee arthroplasty studies comparing the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) and surgical site complications (SSCs) versus standard of care (SOC) following the use of two different ciNPT systems. Four meta-analyses were performed by calculating risk ratios (RR) to assess the effect of (1) ciNPT with foam dressing (ciNPT-F) versus SOC and (2) ciNPT with multilayer absorbent dressing (ciNPT-MLA) versus SOC. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.0 (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ) software was used to perform the analyses. Twelve studies comparing ciNPT-F to SOC and six studies comparing ciNPT-MLAto SOC were analyzed. SSI rates were reported in seven of 12 studies involving ciNPT-F. In those, ciNPT-F significantly reduced the incidence of SSI (RR = .401, 95% confidence interval (CI) = .190, .844; p = .016). Across four of six studies that reported SSI rates, there was no significant difference in SSI rates between ciNPT-MLAvs SOC (RR = .580, 95% CI = .222, 1.513; p = .265). SSC rates were evaluated in eight of 12 ciNPT-F studies that reported SSC rates. This meta-analysis of the eight ciNPT-F studies showed significantly reduced SSC rates with ciNPT-F vs SOC (RR = .332, 95% CI = .236, .467; p < 0.001). For ciNPT-MLA, five of six studies reported SSC rates. In those, there was no significant difference in SSC rates between ciNPT-MLA vs SOC (RR = .798, 95% CI = .458, 1.398; p = .425).

To expand upon previous ciNPT recommendations and provide guidance on this new dressing, an expert panel of plastic surgeons convened to review the current literature, identify challenges to the implementation and sustainability of ciNPT, and use a modified Delphi technique to form a consensus on the appropriate use of ciNPT with full-coverage dressings.

This study investigates the effect of acute IOP elevation on blood flow velocity in the retrobulbar arteries and veins supplying and draining the eye, which, unlike the retinal and choroidal vasculature, are not directly compressed as IOP is increased. By cannulation of the anterior chamber of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, we increased IOP in 10\u202fmmHg steps from 10 to 60\u202fmmHg and returned to 10\u202fmmHg. After 1\u202fmin at each IOP (and 3\u202fmin after return to 10\u202fmmHg), we acquired 18\u202fMHz plane-wave ultrasound data at 3000 compound images/sec for 1.5\u202fs. We produced color-flow Doppler images by digital signal processing of the ultrasound data, identified retrobulbar arteries and veins, generated spectrograms depicting flow velocity over the cardiac cycle and characterized changes of vascular density and perfusion in the orbit overall. Systolic, diastolic and mean velocities and resistive and pulsatile indices were determined from arterial spectrograms at each IOP level. Baseline mean arterial and mean venous velocities averaged 30.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8 and 8.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.3\u202fmm/s, respectively. Arterial velocity progressively decreased and resistance indices increased at and above an IOP of 30\u202fmmHg. Mean arterial velocity at 60\u202fmmHg dropped by 55% with respect to baseline, while venous velocity decreased by 20%. Arterial and venous velocities and resistance returned to near baseline after IOP was restored to 10\u202fmmHg. Both vascular density and orbital perfusion decreased with IOP, but while perfusion returned to near normal when IOP returned to 10\u202fmmHg, density remained reduced. Our findings are consistent with OCT-based studies showing reduced perfusion of the retina at levels comparable to retrobulbar arterial flow velocity change with increased IOP. The lesser effect on venous flow is possibly attributable to partial collapse of the venous lumen as volumetric venous outflow decreased at high IOP. The continued reduction in orbital vascular density 3\u202fmin after restoration of IOP to 10\u202fmmHg might be attributable to persisting narrowing of capillaries, but this needs to be verified in future studies.", "Keywords": ["Blood flow", "Intraocular pressure", "Ocular hypertension", "Rat eye", "Ultrasound"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Choroid", "Ciliary Arteries", "Female", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Ocular Hypertension", "Ophthalmic Artery", "Orbit", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Regional Blood Flow", "Retinal Artery", "Tonometry, Ocular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronald H", "Last Name": "Silverman", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Our aim was to determine if ultrasound can be used to visualize and measure flow dynamics in the retrobulbar vessels supplying and draining the eye and the potential of contrast microbubbles to provide image and measurement enhancement. To accomplish this, we used a 128-element, 18\u00a0MHz linear array ultrasound probe and performed plane-wave imaging of the eyes of Sprague Dawley rats. Compound images were acquired by emitting unfocused wavefronts at multiple angles and combining echo data from all angles to form individual B-scans. Multiple imaging sequences were utilized, compounding up to six angles, with imaging rate of up to 3000 compound B-scans per second and sequence durations from 1.5 to 180\u00a0s. Data were acquired before and after intravenous introduction of contrast microbubbles. We found the total power of the Doppler signal in the image plane to increase approximately 20 fold after injection of contrast, followed by an exponential decay to baseline in about 90\u00a0s, The best-fit time constant of the decay averaged 41\u00a0s. While major vessels and the retinal/choroidal complex were evident pre-contrast, they were dramatically enhanced with contrast present, with details such as choroidal arterioles seen only with contrast. Ocular arteriovenous transit time determined from comparative enhancement curves in arteries and veins was approximately 0.2\u00a0s. In conclusion, plane wave ultrasound, especially with enhancement by contrast microbubbles, offers a means for the study of ocular hemodynamics using the rat eye as a model.", "Keywords": ["Contrast agent", "Microbubble", "Ocular blood flow", "Plane-wave", "Rat eye", "Ultrasound"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Contrast Media", "Models, Animal", "Ophthalmic Artery", "Orbit", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Regional Blood Flow", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Raksha", "Last Name": "Urs", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Ketterling", "Affiliation": "F.L.

Focused, single-element, mechanically scanned transducers are most common in ophthalmology. Specially designed transducers have been used to generate focused, high-intensity ultrasound that through thermal effects has been used to treat glaucoma (via ciliodestruction), tumors, and other pathologies. Linear and annular transducer arrays offer synthetic focusing in which precise timing of the excitation of independently addressable array elements allows formation of a converging wavefront to create a focus at one or more programmable depths. Most recently, linear array-based plane-wave ultrasound, in which the array emits an unfocused wavefront and focusing is performed solely on received data, has been demonstrated for imaging ocular anatomy and blood flow.

Recently Tran-Viet et al. proposed that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants, including the common E140K variant, causes high-grade myopia. To investigate the association of SCO2 mutations with myopia, ophthalmic examinations were performed on 35 E140K carriers, one homozygous infant, and on a mouse model of Sco2 deficiency. Additionally, a screen for other putative effects of SCO2 heterozygosity was carried out by comparing the prevalence of the common E140K variant in a population of patients with undiagnosed diseases compatible with SCO2-related pathogenesis to that in a general population sample. High-grade myopia was not identified in any of the studied individuals. Of the carriers, 17 were emmetropic, and 18 possessed refractive errors. Additionally, no significant axial elongation indicative of high-grade myopia was found in mice carrying E129K (corresponding to E140K in humans) knock-in mutations. The prevalence of E140K carriers in the symptomatic cohort was evaluated as 1:103 (CI: 0.44-2.09) and did not differ significantly from the population prevalence (1:147, CI: 0.45-1.04).Our study demonstrates that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants is not associated with high-grade myopia in either human patients or in mice.", "Keywords": ["E140K carrier", "Myopia", "SCO2 gene
