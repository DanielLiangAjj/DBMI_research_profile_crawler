We now report that RhoA has not only inhibitory but also a stimulatory effect on axon development depending on when and where exerts its action and the downstream effectors involved. In cultured hippocampal neurons, FRET imaging revealed that RhoA activity selectively localizes in growth cones of undifferentiated neurites, while in developing axons it displays a biphasic pattern, being low in nascent axons and high in elongating ones. RhoA-Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling prevents axon initiation but has no effect on elongation, while formin inhibition reduces axon extension without significantly altering initial outgrowth. Besides, RhoA-mDia promotes axon elongation by stimulating growth cone microtubule stability and assembly, as opposed to RhoA-ROCK that restrains growth cone microtubule assembly and protrusion.", "Keywords": ["Axon outgrowth", "Growth Cone", "MDia", "Microtubules", "Neuronal Polarity", "RhoA"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jos\u00e9", "Last Name": "Wojnacki", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Gonzalo", "Last Name": "Quassollo", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Mart\u00edn D", "Last Name": "Bordenave", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Nicol\u00e1s", "Last Name": "Unsain", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Gaby F", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, 5016, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Alan M", "Last Name": "Szalai", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Pertz", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cell Biology, University of Bern, Baltzerstrasse 4, Bern, 3012, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Gregg G", "Last Name": "Gundersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Bartolini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fernando D", "Last Name": "Stefani", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2390, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "C\u00e1ceres", "Affiliation": "Centro Investigaci\u00f3n Medicina Traslacional Severo R Amuch\u00e1stegui (CIMETSA), Instituto Universitario Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas C\u00f3rdoba (IUCBC), Av.

Neuronal MTs are highly heterogeneous due to several tubulin isotypes and the presence of multiple post-translational modifications, such as detyrosination and acetylation. The tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination cycle is a key player in the maintenance of MT dynamics, as tyrosinated tubulin is associated with more dynamic MTs, while detyrosinated tubulin is linked to longer lived, more stable MTs. Dysfunction of tubulin re-tyrosination was recently correlated to Alzheimer's disease progression. The implication of tubulin acetylation in Alzheimer's disease has, however, remained controversial. Here, we demonstrate that tubulin acetylation accumulates in post-mortem brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease patients and human neurons harboring the Alzheimer's familial APP-V717I mutation. We further show that tubulin re-tyrosination, which is defective in Alzheimer's disease, can control acetylated tubulin in primary neurons irrespective of the levels of the enzymes regulating tubulin acetylation, suggesting that reduced MT dynamics associated with impaired tubulin re-tyrosination might contribute to the accumulation of tubulin acetylation that we detected in Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "acetylation", "microtubule", "neuron", "tubulin", "tubulin tyrosine ligase", "tyrosination"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jos\u00e9", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Parato", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aditi", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Marc", "Last Name": "Soleilhac", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyi", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Tein", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Andrieux", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Yves", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Jo", "Last Name": "Moutin", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Bartolini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Leticia", "Last Name": "Peris", "Affiliation": "Inserm, U1216, CEA, CNRS, Grenoble Institut Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35941181", "Title": "Alterations to the broad-spectrum formin inhibitor SMIFH2 modulate potency but not specificity.", "Abstract": "SMIFH2 is a small molecule inhibitor of the formin family of cytoskeletal regulators that was originally identified in a screen for suppression of actin polymerization induced by the mouse formin Diaphanous 1 (mDia1).

We found that TTR KO mice have an intrinsic increase in dynamic MTs and reduced levels of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin in peripheral axons.

CIPN often affects unmyelinated nociceptive sensory terminals. Despite the high prevalence, molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to CIPN are still poorly understood. Here, we used a genetically tractable Drosophila model and primary sensory neurons isolated from adult mouse to examine the mechanisms underlying CIPN and identify protective pathways. We found that chronic treatment of Drosophila larvae with paclitaxel caused degeneration and altered the branching pattern of nociceptive neurons, and reduced thermal nociceptive responses. We further found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins, which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred protection from paclitaxel-induced cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins. Paclitaxel-induced changes in recycling endosomes precede morphological degeneration of nociceptive neuron arbors, which could be prevented by integrin overexpression. We used primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuron cultures to test conservation of integrin-mediated protection. We show that transduction of a human integrin \u03b2-subunit 1 also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment. Furthermore, endogenous levels of surface integrins were decreased in paclitaxel-treated mouse DRG neurons, suggesting that paclitaxel disrupts recycling in vertebrate sensory neurons.

Despite progress in rehabilitative care, there is no effective treatment that stimulates axonal growth following injury. Using models with different regenerative capacities, followed by gain- and loss-of-function analysis, we identified profilin 1 (Pfn1) as a coordinator of actin and microtubules (MTs), powering axonal growth and regeneration. In growth cones, Pfn1 increased actin retrograde flow, MT growth speed, and invasion of filopodia by MTs, orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics toward axonal growth. In vitro, active Pfn1 promoted MT growth in a formin-dependent manner, whereas localization of MTs to growth cone filopodia was facilitated by direct MT binding and interaction with formins. In vivo, Pfn1 ablation limited regeneration of growth-competent axons after sciatic nerve and spinal cord injury. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of constitutively active Pfn1 to rodents promoted axonal regeneration, neuromuscular junction maturation, and functional recovery of injured sciatic nerves, and increased the ability of regenerating axons to penetrate the inhibitory spinal cord glial scar. Thus, we identify Pfn1 as an important regulator of axonal regeneration and suggest that AAV-mediated delivery of constitutively active Pfn1, together with the identification of modulators of Pfn1 activity, should be considered to treat the injured nervous system.", "Keywords": ["Cell Biology", "Cytoskeleton", "Neuroscience"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cytoskeleton", "Dependovirus", "Genetic Therapy", "Growth Cones", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Profilins", "Sciatic Nerve", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Transduction, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Pinto-Costa", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Sara C", "Last Name": "Sousa", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "S\u00e9rgio C", "Last Name": "Leite", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Joana", "Last Name": "Nogueira-Rodrigues", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Tiago", "Last Name": "Ferreira da Silva", "Affiliation": "NeuroLipid Biology Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Diana", "Last Name": "Machado", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Joana", "Last Name": "Marques", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Ana Catarina", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "M\u00e1rcia A", "Last Name": "Liz", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Bartolini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Brites", "Affiliation": "NeuroLipid Biology Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Costell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Estructura de Reserca Interdisciplinar en Biotecnologia i Biomedicina, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Reinhard", "Last Name": "F\u00e4ssler", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Max Plank Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany."}, {"First Name": "M\u00f3nica M", "Last Name": "Sousa", "Affiliation": "Nerve Regeneration Group, Program in Neurobiology and Neurologic Disorders, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC) and Instituto de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o e Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2020Apr01"}, {"PMID": "31813605", "Title": "Activity-Dependent Nucleation of Dynamic Microtubules at Presynaptic Boutons Controls Neurotransmission.", "Abstract": "Control of microtubule (MT) nucleation and dynamics is critical for neuronal function.

Histologically, the Arfgef1fs/+ brain exhibits a disruption in the apical lining of the dentate gyrus and altered spine morphology of deep layer neurons. In primary hippocampal neuron culture, dendritic surface and synaptic but not total GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are reduced in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons with an accompanying decrease in the number of GABAAR-containing recycling endosomes in cell body. Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in the number of GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body. Together, the altered endosome composition and decreased neuronal surface GABAAR results suggests a mechanism whereby impaired neuronal inhibition leads to seizure susceptibility.", "Keywords": ["Endocytic cycle", "Epilepsy", "GABA(A) receptor", "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Child, Preschool", "Endosomes", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Haploinsufficiency", "Humans", "Infant", "Lennox Gastaut Syndrome", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Neurons", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "JiaJie", "Last Name": "Teoh", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America.

Here, we show that the mammalian homolog of Xenopus XKLP1, Kif4, is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of selective MT stabilization in fibroblasts.
