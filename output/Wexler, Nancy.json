The aim of this mixed-methods study was to assess organizational readiness for CHW workforce integration into Arizona Medicaid health systems and care teams. This collaborative effort was in direct response to emergent state and national CHW workforce policy opportunities, and the shifting health care landscape in Arizona - which merged behavior and physical health. Specifically, and in collaboration with a broad-based, statewide CHW workforce coalition, led by the CHW professional association, we assessed 245 licensed health care professionals with experience working with CHWs and 16 Medicaid-contracted health plan leadership. Our goal was to generate a baseline understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs these stakeholders held about the integration of CHWs into systems and teams. Our findings demonstrate a high level of organizational readiness and action toward integration of CHWs within the Arizona health care system and care teams. CHWs have emerged as a health care workforce able to enhance the patient experience of care, improve population health, reduce cost of care, and improve the experience of providing care among clinicians and staff.", "Keywords": ["Community Health Workers", "health systems", "integration", "recruitment", "retention"], "MeSH terms": ["Arizona", "Community Health Workers", "Humans", "Medicaid", "Motivation", "United States", "Workforce"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Sabo", "Affiliation": "Center for Health Equity Research, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Wexler", "Affiliation": "The John A.

It has been difficult to quantitatively detect such pathological seeding activities in patient biosamples, e.g. cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), and study their correlation with the disease manifestation. Here we developed a cell line expressing a domain-engineered mHTT-exon\u00a01 reporter, which showed remarkably high sensitivity and specificity in detecting mHTT seeding species in HD patient biosamples. We showed that the seeding-competent mHTT species in HD CSF are significantly elevated upon disease onset and with the progression of neuropathological grades. Mechanistically, we showed that mHTT seeding activities in patient CSF could be ameliorated by the overexpression of chaperone DNAJB6 and by antibodies against the polyproline domain of mHTT. Together, our study developed a selective and scalable cell-based tool to investigate mHTT seeding activities in HD CSF, and demonstrated that the CSF mHTT seeding species are significantly associated with certain disease states. This seeding activity can be ameliorated by targeting specific domain or proteostatic pathway of mHTT, providing novel insights into such pathological activities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cell Line", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Exons", "Female", "Genes, Reporter", "HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Intravital Microscopy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Chaperones", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Protein Domains", "Protein Engineering", "Protein Folding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C Y Daniel", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Koning", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and BioX Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Stricos", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Langfelder", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristina H", "Last Name": "Cheon", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Etty P", "Last Name": "Cort\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "Division of Aging and Dementia, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harry V", "Last Name": "Vinters", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Division of Aging and Dementia, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Wexler", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Damoiseaux", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Frydman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and BioX Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "X William", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, The Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA. xwyang@mednet.ucla.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Nov20"}, {"PMID": "31059640", "Title": "Oligonucleotide Treatment for Huntington's Disease.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Oligonucleotides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenneth H", "Last Name": "Fischbeck", "Affiliation": "From the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (K.H.F.); and the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and Hereditary Disease Foundation, New York (N.S.W.)."}, {"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Wexler", "Affiliation": "From the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (K.H.F.); and the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and Hereditary Disease Foundation, New York (N.S.W.)."}], "Journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "PubDate": "2019Jun13"}, {"PMID": "29750799", "Title": "Population-specific genetic modification of Huntington's disease in Venezuela.", "Abstract": "Modifiers of Mendelian disorders can provide insights into disease mechanisms and guide therapeutic strategies. A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study discovered genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease (HD) onset in Europeans. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing and GWA analysis of a Venezuelan HD cluster whose families were crucial for the original mapping of the HD gene defect. The Venezuelan HD subjects develop motor symptoms earlier than their European counterparts, implying the potential for population-specific modifiers. The main Venezuelan HD family inherits HTT haplotype hap.03, which differs subtly at the sequence level from European HD hap.03, suggesting a different ancestral origin but not explaining the earlier age at onset in these Venezuelans. GWA analysis of the Venezuelan HD cluster suggests both population-specific and population-shared genetic modifiers. Genome-wide significant signals at 7p21.2-21.1 and suggestive association signals at 4p14 and 17q21.2 are evident only in Venezuelan HD, but genome-wide significant association signals at the established European chromosome 15 modifier locus are improved when Venezuelan HD data are included in the meta-analysis. Venezuelan-specific association signals on chromosome 7 center on SOSTDC1, which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein antagonist. The corresponding SNPs are associated with reduced expression of SOSTDC1 in non-Venezuelan tissue samples, suggesting that interaction of reduced SOSTDC1 expression with a population-specific genetic or environmental factor may be responsible for modification of HD onset in Venezuela. Detection of population-specific modification in Venezuelan HD supports the value of distinct disease populations in revealing novel aspects of a disease and population-relevant therapeutic strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Age of Onset", "Family Health", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genes, Modifier", "Genetics, Population", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proteins", "Venezuela", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kyung-Hee", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jun Wan", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Lucente", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa C", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jared C", "Last Name": "Roach", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leroy", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Wexler", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Jardim", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Holmans", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Department of Psychological Medicine and Neurology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Lesley", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Department of Psychological Medicine and Neurology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Orth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Seung", "Last Name": "Kwak", "Affiliation": "CHDI Foundation, Princeton, New Jersey, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Marcy E", "Last Name": "MacDonald", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "James F", "Last Name": "Gusella", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jong-Min", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "29240886", "Title": "Pope Francis champions Huntington's disease.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Religion and Medicine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Wexler", "Affiliation": "Hereditary Disease Foundation, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2018Feb01"}, {"PMID": "28887402", "Title": "Detection of long repeat expansions from PCR-free whole-genome sequence data.", "Abstract": "Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.",

The clinical manifestation of HD is a progressive physical, cognitive, and psychiatric deterioration that is eventually fatal. The mutant huntingtin protein is processed into several smaller fragments, which have been implicated as critical factors in HD pathogenesis. The search for proteases responsible for their production has led to the identification of several cleavage sites on the huntingtin protein. However, the origin of the small N-terminal fragments that are found in HD postmortem brains has remained elusive. Recent mapping of huntingtin fragments in a mouse model demonstrated that the smallest N-terminal fragment is an exon 1 protein. This discovery spurred our hypothesis that mis-splicing as opposed to proteolysis could be generating the smallest huntingtin fragment. We demonstrated that mis-splicing of mutant huntingtin intron 1 does indeed occur and results in a short polyadenylated mRNA, which is translated into an exon 1 protein. The exon 1 protein fragment is highly pathogenic. Transgenic mouse models containing just human huntingtin exon 1 develop a rapid onset of HD-like symptoms. Our finding that a small, mis-spliced HTT transcript and corresponding exon 1 protein are produced in the context of an expanded CAG repeat has unraveled a new molecular mechanism in HD pathogenesis.
