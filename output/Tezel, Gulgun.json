As much as the synchronized responses of astrocytes and microglia to glaucoma-related stress or neuron injury, their bi-directional interactions are critical to build and amplify neuroinflammation and to dictate the neurodegenerative outcome. Although distinct molecular programs regulate somatic and axonal degeneration in glaucoma, inhibition of neurodegenerative inflammation can provide a broadly beneficial treatment strategy to rescue RGC integrity and function.

As much as intrinsic responses of RGCs themselves, divergent responses and intricate interactions of the surrounding glia also play decisive roles for the cell fate.

This study investigates the effect of acute IOP elevation on blood flow velocity in the retrobulbar arteries and veins supplying and draining the eye, which, unlike the retinal and choroidal vasculature, are not directly compressed as IOP is increased. By cannulation of the anterior chamber of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, we increased IOP in 10\u202fmmHg steps from 10 to 60\u202fmmHg and returned to 10\u202fmmHg. After 1\u202fmin at each IOP (and 3\u202fmin after return to 10\u202fmmHg), we acquired 18\u202fMHz plane-wave ultrasound data at 3000 compound images/sec for 1.5\u202fs. We produced color-flow Doppler images by digital signal processing of the ultrasound data, identified retrobulbar arteries and veins, generated spectrograms depicting flow velocity over the cardiac cycle and characterized changes of vascular density and perfusion in the orbit overall. Systolic, diastolic and mean velocities and resistive and pulsatile indices were determined from arterial spectrograms at each IOP level. Baseline mean arterial and mean venous velocities averaged 30.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8 and 8.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.3\u202fmm/s, respectively. Arterial velocity progressively decreased and resistance indices increased at and above an IOP of 30\u202fmmHg. Mean arterial velocity at 60\u202fmmHg dropped by 55% with respect to baseline, while venous velocity decreased by 20%. Arterial and venous velocities and resistance returned to near baseline after IOP was restored to 10\u202fmmHg. Both vascular density and orbital perfusion decreased with IOP, but while perfusion returned to near normal when IOP returned to 10\u202fmmHg, density remained reduced. Our findings are consistent with OCT-based studies showing reduced perfusion of the retina at levels comparable to retrobulbar arterial flow velocity change with increased IOP. The lesser effect on venous flow is possibly attributable to partial collapse of the venous lumen as volumetric venous outflow decreased at high IOP. The continued reduction in orbital vascular density 3\u202fmin after restoration of IOP to 10\u202fmmHg might be attributable to persisting narrowing of capillaries, but this needs to be verified in future studies.", "Keywords": ["Blood flow", "Intraocular pressure", "Ocular hypertension", "Rat eye", "Ultrasound"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Choroid", "Ciliary Arteries", "Female", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Ocular Hypertension", "Ophthalmic Artery", "Orbit", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Regional Blood Flow", "Retinal Artery", "Tonometry, Ocular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronald H", "Last Name": "Silverman", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

While the experimental research using animal models provides growing information about cellular and molecular processes, parallel analysis of the clinical presentation of glaucoma accelerates the translational progress towards improved understanding, treatment, and clinical testing of glaucoma. Optic nerve axon injury triggers early alterations of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapses with function deficits prior to manifest RGC loss in animal models of glaucoma. For testing the clinical relevance of experimental observations, this study analyzed the functional correlation of localized alterations in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where RGCs establish synaptic connections with retinal bipolar and amacrine cells. Participants of the study included a retrospective cohort of 36 eyes with glaucoma and a control group of 18 non-glaucomatous subjects followed for two-years. The IPL was analyzed on consecutively collected macular SD-OCT scans, and functional correlations with corresponding 10-2 visual field scores were tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. The GEE-estimated rate of decrease in IPL thickness (R = 0.36, P<0.001) and IPL density (R = 0.36, P<0.001), as opposed to unchanged or increased IPL thickness or density, was significantly associated with visual field worsening at corresponding analysis locations. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, this association was independent from the patients' age, the baseline visual field scores, or the baseline thickness or alterations of retinal nerve fiber or RGC layers (P>0.05). These findings support early localized IPL alterations in correlation with progressing visual field defects in glaucomatous eyes.

Recent evidence implicates several new signaling mechanisms as causal agents associated with RGC injury and remodeling of the optic nerve head. Ion channels such as Transient receptor potential vanilloid isoform 4 (TRPV4), pannexin-1 (Panx1) and P2X7 receptor are localized to RGCs and act as potential sensors and effectors of mechanical strain, ischemia and inflammatory responses. Under normal conditions, TRPV4 may function as an osmosensor and a polymodal molecular integrator of diverse mechanical and chemical stimuli, whereas P2X7R and Panx1 respond to stretch- and/or swelling-induced adenosine triphosphate release from neurons and glia. Ca(2+) influx, induced by stimulation of mechanosensitive ion channels in glaucoma, is proposed to influence dendritic and axonal remodeling that may lead to RGC death while (at least initially) sparing other classes of retinal neuron. The secondary phase of the retinal glaucoma response is associated with microglial activation and an inflammatory response involving Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) immune recognition molecules associated with the T-cell antigen receptor, complement molecules and cell type-specific release of neuroactive cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). The retinal response to mechanical stress thus involves a diversity of signaling pathways that sense and transduce mechanical strain and orchestrate both protective and destructive secondary responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kri\u017eaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences ."}, {"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Ryskamp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "G\u00fclg\u00fcn", "Last Name": "Tezel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claire H", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vladlen Z", "Last Name": "Slepak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valery I", "Last Name": "Shestopalov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current eye research", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23396249", "Title": "A proteomics view of the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.", "Abstract": "Despite improving understanding of glaucoma, key molecular players of neurodegeneration that can be targeted for treatment of glaucoma, or molecular biomarkers that can be useful for clinical testing, remain unclear.

Recent studies of glaucoma using proteomics analysis techniques have resulted in the lists of differentially expressed proteins in human glaucoma and animal models. The global analysis of protein expression in glaucoma has been followed by cell-specific proteome analysis of retinal ganglion cells and astrocytes.
