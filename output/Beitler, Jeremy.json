previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Methods: We summarized evidence addressing four \"PICO questions\" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations. Results: We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Conclusions: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.", "Keywords": ["acute respiratory distress syndrome", "corticosteroids", "extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", "neuromuscular blockade", "positive end-expiratory pressure"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Lung", "Neuromuscular Blocking Agents", "Positive-Pressure Respiration", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nida", "Last Name": "Qadir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarina", "Last Name": "Sahetya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laveena", "Last Name": "Munshi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charlotte", "Last Name": "Summers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darryl", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giacomo", "Last Name": "Bellani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roy G", "Last Name": "Brower", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Burry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jen-Ting", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol", "Last Name": "Hodgson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine L", "Last Name": "Hough", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francois", "Last Name": "Lamontagne", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anica", "Last Name": "Law", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "Papazian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tai", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Siuba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irene", "Last Name": "Telias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Setu", "Last Name": "Patolia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dipayan", "Last Name": "Chaudhuri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Allan", "Last Name": "Walkey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bram", "Last Name": "Rochwerg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eddy", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2024Jan01"}, {"PMID": "37784109", "Title": "Frequency of screening and SBT Technique Trial-North American Weaning Collaboration (FAST-NAWC): an update to the protocol and statistical analysis plan.", "Abstract": "This update summarizes key changes made to the protocol for the Frequency of Screening and Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) Technique Trial-North American Weaning Collaborative (FAST-NAWC) trial since the publication of the original protocol.

Some centers consider obesity a relative contraindication to receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, despite growing implementation of ECMO for ARDS in the general population. Objectives: To investigate the association between obesity and mortality in patients with ARDS receiving ECMO. Methods: In this large, international, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the association of obesity, defined as body mass index\u2009\u2a7e\u200930\u2009kg/m2, with ICU mortality in patients receiving ECMO for ARDS by performing adjusted multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching. Measurements and Main Results: Of 790 patients with ARDS receiving ECMO in our study, 320 had obesity. Of those, 24.1% died in the ICU, compared with 35.3% of patients without obesity (P\u2009<\u20090.001). In adjusted models, obesity was associated with lower ICU mortality (odds ratio, 0.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.93]; P\u2009=\u20090.018). Examined as a continuous variable, higher body mass index was associated with decreased ICU mortality in multivariable regression (odds ratio, 0.97 [95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.00]; P\u2009=\u20090.023). In propensity score matching of 199 patients with obesity to 199 patients without, patients with obesity had a lower probability of ICU death than those without (22.6% vs. 35.2%; P\u2009=\u20090.007). Conclusions: Among patients receiving ECMO for ARDS, those with obesity had lower ICU mortality than patients without obesity in multivariable and propensity score matching analyses. Our findings support the notion that obesity should not be considered a general contraindication to ECMO.", "Keywords": ["acute respiratory distress syndrome", "extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation", "Retrospective Studies", "Obesity", "Body Mass Index", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Darya", "Last Name": "Rudym", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "T\u00e0i", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "Service de M\u00e9decine Intensive-R\u00e9animation, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital de Bic\u00eatre, DMU CORREVE, FHU SEPSIS, Groupe de Recherche CARMAS, Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre, France."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Rackley", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Giacomo", "Last Name": "Grasselli", "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia Medico-Chirurgica e dei Trapianti, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italia."}, {"First Name": "Michaela", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Baldwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cara", "Last Name": "Agerstrand", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alexis", "Last Name": "Serra", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lisle A", "Last Name": "Winston", "Affiliation": "Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Desiree", "Last Name": "Bonadonna", "Affiliation": "Perfusion Services, Duke University Health System, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Yip", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Logan J", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Duke Respiratory Care Services, Duke University Hospital, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Dzierba", "Affiliation": "Center for Acute Respiratory Failure and."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Sonett", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Darryl", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Niall D", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, Vanderbilt Medical Center East, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Matthieu", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, GRC 30 RESPIRE, UMRS_1166-ICAN, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Brodie", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "LIFEGARDS collaborators", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2023Sep15"}, {"PMID": "37348524", "Title": "Intravenous aviptadil and remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19-associated hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the USA (TESICO): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "There is a clinical need for therapeutics for COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure whose 60-day mortality remains at 30-50%.

The scope of this CPG is limited to adult patients and to non-pharmacological respiratory support strategies across different aspects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including ARDS due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines were formulated by an international panel of clinical experts, one methodologist and patients' representatives on behalf of the ESICM. The review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations and the quality of reporting of each study based on the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) network guidelines. The CPG addressed 21 questions and formulates 21 recommendations on the following domains: (1) definition; (2) phenotyping, and respiratory support strategies including (3) high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNO); (4) non-invasive ventilation (NIV); (5) tidal volume setting; (6) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers (RM); (7) prone positioning; (8) neuromuscular blockade, and (9) extracorporeal life support (ECLS). In addition, the CPG includes expert opinion on clinical practice and identifies the areas of future research.", "Keywords": ["Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure", "Acute respiratory distress syndrome", "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", "Mechanical ventilation", "Non-invasive ventilation", "Practice guidelines", "Prognosis", "Prone position"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "COVID-19", "Respiration, Artificial", "Positive-Pressure Respiration", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Critical Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giacomo", "Last Name": "Grasselli", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. giacomo.grasselli@unimi.it."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn S", "Last Name": "Calfee", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Camporota", "Affiliation": "Department of Adult Critical Care, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniele", "Last Name": "Poole", "Affiliation": "Operative Unit of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, S.

Methods: We conducted a network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation methodology. Measurements and Main Results: We included 18 randomized trials (4,646 participants).

Some patients may benefit from ultra-lung-protective ventilation, a strategy that achieves lower airway pressures and Vt than the current standard. Specific physiological parameters beyond severity of hypoxemia, such as driving pressure and respiratory system elastance, may be predictive of those most likely to benefit. Because application of ultra-lung-protective ventilation is often limited by respiratory acidosis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, which remove carbon dioxide from blood, is an attractive option. These strategies are associated with hematological complications, especially when applied at low blood-flow rates with devices designed for higher blood flows, and a recent large randomized controlled trial failed to show a benefit from an extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal-facilitated ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategy. Only in patients with very severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome has the use of an ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategy-accomplished with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-been suggested to have a favorable risk-to-benefit profile. In this critical care perspective, we address key areas of controversy related to ultra-lung-protective ventilation, including the trade-offs between minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury and the risks from strategies to achieve this added protection.

Objectives: To identify clinically relevant, novel subgroups in COVID-19-related ARDS and compare them with previously described ARDS subphenotypes. Methods: Eligible participants were adults with COVID-19 and ARDS at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups with baseline clinical, respiratory, and laboratory data serving as partitioning variables. A previously developed machine learning model was used to classify patients as the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between subgroups. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for corticosteroid use in subgroups was tested. Measurements and Main Results: From March 2, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 483 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS met study criteria. A two-class latent class analysis model best fit the population (P\u2009=\u20090.0075). Class 2 (23%) had higher proinflammatory markers, troponin, creatinine, and lactate, lower bicarbonate, and lower blood pressure than class 1 (77%). Ninety-day mortality was higher in class 2 versus class 1 (75% vs. 48%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Considerable overlap was observed between these subgroups and ARDS subphenotypes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR cycle threshold was associated with mortality in the hypoinflammatory but not the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Heterogeneity of treatment effect to corticosteroids was observed (P\u2009=\u20090.0295), with improved mortality in the hyperinflammatory phenotype and worse mortality in the hypoinflammatory phenotype, with the caveat that corticosteroid treatment was not randomized. Conclusions: We identified two COVID-19-related ARDS subgroups with differential outcomes, similar to previously described ARDS subphenotypes.

Objectives: To evaluate whether multiorgan dysfunction and lung mechanics modified treatment effect in the EPVent-2 (Esophageal Pressure-guided Ventilation 2) trial, a multicenter trial of esophageal pressure (Pes)-guided PEEP versus empirical high PEEP in moderate to severe ARDS. Methods: This post hoc reanalysis of the EPVent-2 trial evaluated for heterogeneity of treatment effect on mortality by baseline multiorgan dysfunction, determined via Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II). It also evaluated whether PEEP titrated to end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure near 0 cm H2O was associated with survival. Measurements and Main Results: All 200 trial participants were included. Treatment effect on 60-day mortality differed by multiorgan dysfunction severity (P\u2009=\u20090.03 for interaction). Pes-guided PEEP was associated with lower mortality among patients with APACHE-II less than the median value (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.92) and may have had the opposite effect in patients with higher APACHE-II (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-3.05). Independent of treatment group or multiorgan dysfunction severity, mortality was lowest when PEEP titration achieved end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure near 0 cm H2O. Conclusions: The effect on survival of Pes-guided PEEP, compared with empirical high PEEP, differed by multiorgan dysfunction severity.

Understanding of the complex pathways involved in lung injury pathogenesis, resolution, and repair has grown considerably in recent decades. Nevertheless, to date, only therapies targeting ventilation-induced lung injury have consistently proven beneficial, and despite these gains, ARDS morbidity and mortality remain high. Many candidate therapies with promise in preclinical studies have been ineffective in human trials, probably at least in part due to clinical and biological heterogeneity that modifies treatment responsiveness in human ARDS. A precision medicine approach to ARDS seeks to better account for this heterogeneity by matching therapies to subgroups of patients that are anticipated to be most likely to benefit, which initially might be identified in part by assessing for heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials. In October 2019, the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop of multidisciplinary experts to explore research opportunities and challenges for accelerating precision medicine in ARDS. Topics of discussion included the rationale and challenges for a precision medicine approach in ARDS, the roles of preclinical ARDS models in precision medicine, essential features of cohort studies to advance precision medicine, and novel approaches to clinical trials to support development and validation of a precision medicine strategy. In this Position Paper, we summarise workshop discussions, recommendations, and unresolved questions for advancing precision medicine in ARDS. Although the workshop took place before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for precision therapies for ARDS as the global scientific community grapples with many of the key concepts, innovations, and challenges discussed at this workshop.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Humans", "Precision Medicine", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Center for Acute Respiratory Failure and Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "B Taylor", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Baron", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Bastarache", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Loren C", "Last Name": "Denlinger", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Esserman", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle N", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "LaVange", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger J", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA; Berry Consultants, LLC, Austin, TX; Department of Emergency Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Marshall", "Affiliation": "Departments of Surgery and Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Thomas R", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel F", "Last Name": "McAuley", "Affiliation": "Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, Queen's University Belfast and Regional Intensive Care Unit, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Nuala J", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Moss", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lora A", "Last Name": "Reineck", "Affiliation": "Division of Lung Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "ARDS Foundation, Northbrook, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric P", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Theodore J", "Last Name": "Standiford", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lorraine B", "Last Name": "Ware", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hector R", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil R", "Last Name": "Aggarwal", "Affiliation": "Division of Lung Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Summary: A 46-year-old woman with history of bipolar disorder with psychotic features presented to the intensive care unit with asterixis and elevations in liver enzymes. The patient had been initiated on risperidone, clozapine, and lithium approximately 1\u00a0month prior to admission. After ruling out other possible non-drug etiologies, clozapine was suspected as the likeliest cause of the acute liver injury. Her acute liver injury was managed with the discontinuation of all antipsychotics, administration of IV NAC, and other standard of care supportive measures. Conclusion: Although clozapine has been associated with hepatitis and acute liver failure, there are no reports of NAC used in the management of clozapine-induced hepatotoxicity. NAC was used in our patient after considering the potential benefit and limited adverse effects. The role of NAC in non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure remains promising, but more research is warranted.", "Keywords": ["acetylcysteine", "clozapine", "drug-induced liver injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Acetylcysteine", "Clozapine", "Liver Failure, Acute", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, 3740UPMC Pinnacle, Harrisburg, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Muir", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 182047NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Furfaro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 182047NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 182047NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy L", "Last Name": "Dzierba", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 182047NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of pharmacy practice", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "34115638", "Title": "Discordance Between Respiratory Drive and Sedation Depth in Critically Ill Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation.", "Abstract": "In mechanically ventilated patients, deep sedation is often assumed to induce \"respirolysis,\" that is, lyse spontaneous respiratory effort, whereas light sedation is often assumed to preserve spontaneous effort.

Many clinicians might be sceptical that Bayesian analysis, a philosophical and statistical approach that combines prior beliefs with data to generate probabilities, provides more useful information about clinical trials than the frequentist approach. In this Personal View, we introduce clinicians to the rationale, process, and interpretation of Bayesian analysis through a systematic review and reanalysis of interventional trials in critical illness. In the majority of cases, Bayesian and frequentist analyses agreed. In the remainder, Bayesian analysis identified interventions where benefit was probable despite the absence of statistical significance, where interpretation depended substantially on choice of prior distribution, and where benefit was improbable despite statistical significance. Bayesian analysis in critical care medicine can help to distinguish harm from uncertainty and establish the probability of clinically important benefit for clinicians, policy makers, and patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bayes Theorem", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Critical Care", "Humans", "Probability", "Research Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Yarnell", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Improvement in oxygenation and reduction in mortality are the main reasons to implement prone position in patients with ARDS. The main reason explaining a decreased mortality is less overdistension in non-dependent lung regions and less cyclical opening and closing in dependent lung regions. The only absolute contraindication for implementing prone position is an unstable spinal fracture. The maneuver to change from supine to prone and vice versa requires a skilled team of 4-5 caregivers. The most frequent adverse events are pressure sores and facial edema.

Although the importance and impact of lung-protective ventilation is widely appreciated and well established, the concept of diaphragm-protective ventilation has recently emerged as a potential complementary therapeutic strategy. This Perspective, developed from discussions at a meeting of international experts convened by PLUG (the Pleural Pressure Working Group) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, outlines a conceptual framework for an integrated lung- and diaphragm-protective approach to mechanical ventilation on the basis of growing evidence about mechanisms of injury. We propose targets for diaphragm protection based on respiratory effort and patient-ventilator synchrony. The potential for conflict between diaphragm protection and lung protection under certain conditions is discussed; we emphasize that when conflicts arise, lung protection must be prioritized over diaphragm protection. Monitoring respiratory effort is essential to concomitantly protect both the diaphragm and the lung during mechanical ventilation. To implement lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation, new approaches to monitoring, to setting the ventilator, and to titrating sedation will be required. Adjunctive interventions, including extracorporeal life support techniques, phrenic nerve stimulation, and clinical decision-support systems, may also play an important role in selected patients in the future. Evaluating the clinical impact of this new paradigm will be challenging, owing to the complexity of the intervention. The concept of lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation presents a new opportunity to potentially improve clinical outcomes for critically ill patients.", "Keywords": ["artificial respiration",

However, excessive effort to breathe due to high respiratory drive may lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), even in the absence of mechanical ventilation.

We summarize the main determinants of neural respiratory drive and the mechanisms involved in its potentiation, in health and ARDS. We also describe potential and pitfalls of the available bedside methods for drive assessment and explore classical and more \"futuristic\" interventions to control drive in ARDS patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Diaphragm", "Humans", "Lung", "Respiration", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Spinelli", "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Anestesia, Rianimazione ed Emergenza-Urgenza, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Milano, Via F.

Efforts to minimize this injury are typically limited by the need to preserve adequate gas exchange. In the most severe forms of the syndrome, extracorporeal life support is increasingly being deployed for severe hypoxemia or hypercapnic acidosis refractory to conventional ventilator management strategies. Data from a recent randomized controlled trial, a post hoc analysis of that trial, a meta-analysis, and a large international multicenter observational study suggest that extracorporeal life support, when combined with lower Vt and airway pressures than the current standard of care, may improve outcomes compared with conventional management in patients with the most severe forms of ARDS. These findings raise important questions not only about the optimal ventilation strategies for patients receiving extracorporeal support but also regarding how various mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS may potentially be mitigated by ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategies when gas exchange is sufficiently managed with the extracorporeal circuit.

Paramount to the care of affected patients is the delivery of lung-protective mechanical ventilation which prioritizes tidal volume and plateau pressure limitation. Lung protection can probably be further enhanced by scaling target tidal volumes to the specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients. The best procedure for selecting optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS remains uncertain; several relevant issues must be considered when selecting PEEP, particularly lung recruitability. Noninvasive ventilation must be used with caution in ARDS as excessively high respiratory drive can further exacerbate lung injury; newer modes of delivery offer promising approaches in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Airway pressure release ventilation offers an alternative approach to maximize lung recruitment and oxygenation, but clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit of this mode over conventional ventilation strategies. Rescue therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is an important option in refractory hypoxemia. Despite a disappointing lack of benefit (and possible harm) in patients with moderate or severe ARDS, possibly due to lung hyperdistention and right ventricular dysfunction, high-frequency oscillation may improve outcome in patients with very severe hypoxemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "High-Frequency Ventilation", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Noninvasive Ventilation", "Positive-Pressure Respiration", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Tidal Volume"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Sklar", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Bhakti K", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Center for Acute Respiratory Failure and Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Piraino", "Affiliation": "Keenan Centre for Biomedical Research, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ewan C", "Last Name": "Goligher", "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Journal": "Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2019Feb"}, {"PMID": "30872586", "Title": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome.", "Abstract": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients and is defined by the acute onset of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, hypoxaemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. ARDS occurs most often in the setting of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents or severe trauma and is present in ~10% of all patients in intensive care units worldwide. Despite some improvements, mortality remains high at 30-40% in most studies. Pathological specimens from patients with ARDS frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory oedematous fluid in the alveolar space. Diagnosis is based on consensus syndromic criteria, with modifications for under-resourced settings and in paediatric patients. Treatment focuses on lung-protective ventilation; no specific pharmacotherapies have been identified. Long-term outcomes of patients with ARDS are increasingly recognized as important research targets, as many patients survive ARDS only to have ongoing functional and/or psychological sequelae.

Mechanical ventilation in critical illnesses is also a risk factor for AKI, but it is potentially modifiable. Injurious ventilation strategies may lead to the systemic release of inflammatory mediators from the lung due to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). The systemic consequences of VILI are difficult to differentiate clinically from other systemic inflammatory syndromes, such as sepsis. The purpose of this study was to identify unique changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators in kidney tissue in response to VILI compared with systemic sepsis to gain insight into direct effects of VILI on the kidney. Four groups of mice were compared-mice with sepsis from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), mice subjected to injurious mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes (VILI), mice exposed to CLP followed by VILI (CLP+VILI), and sham controls. Protein expression of common inflammatory mediators in kidneys was analyzed using a proteome array and confirmed by Western blot analysis or ELISA. VEGF and VCAM-1 were found to be significantly elevated in kidneys from VILI mice compared with sham and CLP. Angiopoietin-2 was significantly increased in CLP+VILI compared with CLP alone and was also correlated with higher levels of AKI biomarker, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These results suggest that VILI alters the renal expression of VEGF, VCAM-1, and angiopoietin-2, and these proteins warrant further investigation as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": ["lung-kidney crosstalk"], "MeSH terms": ["Angiopoietin-2", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endothelial Cells", "Inflammation Mediators", "Kidney", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Proteomics", "Respiration, Artificial", "Sepsis", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation", "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Hepokoski", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Englert", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Baron", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; and."}, {"First Name": "Laura E", "Last Name": "Crotty-Alexander", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Fuster", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Prabhleen", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California; p1singh@ucsd.edu."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.
