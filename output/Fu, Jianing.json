[{"PMID": "38762429", "Title": "Immune cell profiling in intestinal transplantation.", "Abstract": "Since the first published case study of human intestinal transplantation in 1967, there have been significant studies of intestinal transplant immunology in both animal models and humans. An improved understanding of the profiles of different immune cell subsets is critical for understanding their contributions to graft outcomes. While different studies have focused on the contribution of one or a few subsets to intestinal transplant, no study has integrated these data for a comprehensive overview of immune dynamics after intestinal transplant. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature on different immune subsets and discuss their roles in intestinal transplant outcomes on multiple levels, focusing on chimerism and graft immune reconstitution, clonal alloreactivity, and cell phenotype. In Sections 1, 2 and 3, we lay out a shared framework for understanding intestinal transplant, focusing on the mechanisms of rejection or tolerance in the context of mucosal immunology and illustrate the unique role of the bidirectional graft-versus-host (GvH) and host-versus-graft (HvG) alloresponse. In Sections 4, 5 and 6, we further expand upon these concepts as we discuss the contribution of different cell subsets to intestinal transplant. An improved understanding of intestinal transplantation immunology will bring us closer to maximizing the potential of this important treatment.", "Keywords": ["Bidirectional alloresponse", "Chimerism", "Immune cell profiling", "Intestinal transplantation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "Suek", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tyla", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and oxidative stress are closely associated with progressive senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The vascular protective effect of FGF21 has gradually gained increasing attention, but its role in diabetes-induced vascular senescence needs further investigation. In this study, diabetic mice and primary VSMCs are transfected with an FGF21 activation plasmid and treated with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonist (rosiglitazone), an NLRP3 inhibitor (MCC950), and a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-specific inhibitor, R406, to detect senescence-associated markers. We find that FGF21 overexpression significantly restores the level of catalase (CAT), vascular relaxation, inhibits the intensity of ROSgreen fluorescence and p21 immunofluorescence, and reduces the area of SA-\u03b2-gal staining and collagen deposition in the aortas of diabetic mice. FGF21 overexpression restores CAT, inhibits the expression of p21, and limits the area of SA-\u03b2-gal staining in VSMCs under high glucose conditions. Mechanistically, FGF21 inhibits SYK phosphorylation, the production of the NLRP3 dimer, the expression of NLRP3, and the colocalization of NLRP3 with PYCARD (ASC), as well as NLRP3 with caspase-1, to reverse the cleavage of PPAR\u03b3, preserve CAT levels, suppress ROSgreen density, and reduce the expression of p21 in VSMCs under high glucose conditions. Our results suggest that FGF21 alleviates vascular senescence by regulating the SYK-NLRP3 inflammasome-PPAR\u03b3-catalase pathway in diabetic mice.", "Keywords": ["NLRP3 inflammasome", "PPAR\u03b3", "catalase", "senescence", "vascular smooth muscle cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Syk Kinase", "PPAR gamma", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Inflammasomes", "Mice", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Cellular Senescence", "Male", "Signal Transduction", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanyan", "Last Name": "Heng", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Linzhong", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of National Institute for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Phase I Clinical Trial Laboratory, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Feifei", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Haoyu", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingxia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Bingjie", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyue", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Imageology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunyan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Haiju", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Haihua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China."}], "Journal": "Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38643945", "Title": "Inhibition of YAP/TAZ pathway contributes to the cytotoxicity of silibinin in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.", "Abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers threatening women's health. Our previous study found that silibinin induced the death of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. We noticed that silibinin-induced cell damage was accompanied by morphological changes, including the increased cell aspect ratio (cell length/width) and decreased cell area. Besides, the cytoskeleton is also destroyed in cells treated with silibinin. YAP/TAZ, a mechanical signal sensor interacted with extracellular pressure, cell adhesion area and cytoskeleton, is also closely associated with cell survival, proliferation and migration. Thus, the involvement of YAP/TAZ in the cytotoxicity of silibinin in breast cancer cells has attracted our interests. Excitingly, we find that silibinin inhibits the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and reduces the mRNA expressions of YAP/TAZ target genes, ACVR1, MnSOD and ANKRD. More importantly, expression of YAP1 gene is negatively correlated with the survival of the patients with breast cancers. Molecular docking analysis reveals high probabilities for binding of silibinin to the proteins in the YAP pathways. DARTS and CETSA results confirm the binding abilities of silibinin to YAP and LATS. Inhibiting YAP pathway either by addition of verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP/TAZ-TEAD, or by transfection of si-RNAs targeting YAP or TAZ further enhances silibinin-induced cell damage. While enhancing YAP activity by silencing LATS1/2 or overexpressing YAPS127/397A, an active form of YAP, attenuates silibinin-induced cell damage.

EV-D68 is known to cause respiratory illness in children that can lead to acute flaccid myelitis. Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) is commonly associated with hand-foot-mouth disease. There is no antiviral treatment available for either. We have developed an isoxazole-3-carboxamide analog of pleconaril (11526092) which displayed potent inhibition of EV-D68 (IC50 58\u00a0nM) as well as other enteroviruses including the pleconaril-resistant Coxsackievirus B3-Woodruff (IC50 6-20\u00a0nM) and CVB5 (EC50 1\u00a0nM). Cryo-electron microscopy structures of EV-D68 in complex with 11526092 and pleconaril demonstrate destabilization of the EV-D68 MO strain VP1 loop, and a strain-dependent effect. A mouse respiratory model of EV-D68 infection, showed 3-log decreased viremia, favorable cytokine response, as well as statistically significant 1-log reduction in lung titer reduction at day 5 after treatment with 11526092. An acute flaccid myelitis neurological infection model did not show efficacy. 11526092 was tested in a mouse model of CVB5 infection and showed a 4-log TCID50 reduction in the pancreas.

The correlation of T-cell repertoire with the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains largely undefined. Here, by utilizing high-throughput sequencing of the genes encoding TCR\u03b2-chain, we comprehensively analyzed the profile of T-cell repertoire in recipient lymphoid and GVHD target organs after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice. In lymphoid organs, TCR diversity was narrowed, accompanied with reduced numbers of unique clones while increased accumulation of dominant clones in allogeneic T cells compared to syngeneic T cells. In an individual allogeneic recipient, donor-derived TCR clones were highly overlapped among tissue sites, and the degree of overlapping was increasing from day 7 to 14 after allogeneic BMT. The top clones in peripheral blood, gut, liver, and lungs were highly mutually shared in an allogenic recipient, indicating that blood has the potential to predict dominant clones in these GVHD target organs. T cells in GVHD target organs from allogeneic recipients had fewer overlapped clones with pre-transplant donor T cells compared to those from syngeneic recipients. Importantly, the top 10 clones in allogeneic recipients were not detectable in pre-transplant donor T cells, indicating clonal expansion of rare rearrangements. Interestingly, even starting from the same pool of donor repertoires, T cells had very few overlapped clones between each allogeneic recipient who developed completely different dominant clones. We were only able to trace a single clone shared by three replicate allogeneic recipients within the top 500 clones. Although dominant clones were different among allogeneic recipients, V26 genes were consistently used more frequently by TCR clones in allogeneic than syngeneic recipients. This is the first study to extensively examine the feature of T-cell repertoire in multiple lymphoid and parenchyma organs, which establishes the association between T-cell activation and GVHD pathogenesis at the level of TCR clones.

The hippocampal aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) appeared in MPTP-injected mice, but were significantly decreased by silibinin treatment. MPTP injection induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD). The oxidative stress was alleviated by silibinin treatment.

The UV dose-response behavior of PBCV-1 to monochromatic UV radiation at 254 nm and action spectrum for wavelengths ranging from 214 to 289 nm were measured. A culture-based infectivity assay was used to evaluate viral inactivation, and a quantitative PCR assay was used to quantify DNA damage. A UV254 dose of 150 mJ/cm2 resulted in roughly 5-log10 units of reduction of PBCV-1, which is similar to that of adenovirus. Furthermore, the inactivation action spectrum of PBCV-1 was similar to that of adenovirus between 214 and 289 nm. A simplified and inexpensive prepurification method was also developed to prepare PBCV-1 viral suspensions with similar inactivation behavior to purified PBCV-1.

Far less clear is whether these CRBN E3 ligase-modulating compounds disrupt the endogenous functions of CRBN. We report that CRBN functions in a feedback loop that harnesses antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell effector responses. Specifically, Crbn deficiency in murine CD8+ T cells augments their central metabolism manifested as elevated bioenergetics, with supraphysiological levels of polyamines, secondary to enhanced glucose and amino acid transport, and with increased expression of metabolic enzymes, including the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Treatment with CRBN-modulating compounds similarly augments central metabolism of human CD8+ T cells.

We report here three important questions yet unclarified in the previous study; 1) Whether enhanced fission of mitochondria by the treatment of silibinin leads to mitophagy, 2) Whether mitophagy positively contributes to apoptosis and 3) Whether estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7\u00a0cells and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells are affected in a different way by silibinin treatment, since silibinin often works through ERs signaling pathway. Mitophagy driven by Pink1/Parkin signaling, plays an important role in eliminating damaged mitochondria. Indeed, increased expression of Pink1 and the recruitment of Parkin and LC3-II to mitochondria by the treatment with silibinin account for silibinin induction of mitophagy. In this study, the effects of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1) and small interfering RNA targeting dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) were examined to reveal the effect of mitochondrial fission on mitophagy. As expected, mdivi-1 or siRNA targeting DRP1 reversed silibinin-induced mitochondrial fission due to down-regulation in the expression of DRP1. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission by mdivi-1 prevented induction of mitophagy as well as autophagy in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells, indicating that silibinin-induced mitochondrial fission leads to mitophagy. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission efficiently prevented silibinin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells in our previous work, and the second point of the present study, inhibition of mitophagy by Pink1 or Parkin knockdown increased silibinin-induced apoptosis of these cells, respectively, suggesting that the mitophagy induced by silibinin treatment serves as a cytoprotective effect, resulting in reduction of apoptosis of cancer cells in both cells. In the third point, we studied whether estrogen receptors (ERs) played a role in silibinin-induced mitophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells. ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are not involved in silibinin-induced mitophagic process in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells.

Mitochondria play a major role in cancer progression, including metastasis. Changes in mitochondrial architecture affect cellular migration, autophagy and apoptosis. Silibinin is reported to have anti-breast cancer effect. We here report that silibinin at lower concentrations (30-90\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MDA-MB-231, by increasing the expression of epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and decreasing the expression of mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and vimentin. Besides, silibinin inhibition of cell migration is associated with reduction in the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9) and paxillin. In addition, silibinin treatment increases mitochondrial fusion through down-regulating the expression of mitochondrial fission-associated protein dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and up-regulating the expression of mitochondrial fusion-associated proteins, optic atrophy 1, mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2. Silibinin perturbed mitochondrial biogenesis via down-regulating the levels of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators including mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1) and nuclear respiratory factor (NRF2). Moreover, DRP1 knockdown or silibinin inhibited cell migration, and MFN1&2 knockdown restored it. Mitochondrial fusion contributes to silibinin's negative effect on cell migration. Silibinin decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, leading to inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, knockdown of mitofusin 1&2 (MFN 1&2) relieved silibinin-induced inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Repression of ROS contributes to the inhibition of the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-\u03b2 proteins as well as of cell migration.

In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient. These results suggest that early expansion of donor-specific Tregs is involved in tolerance induction following CKBMT.", "Keywords": ["Immunology", "Organ transplantation", "T-cell receptor",

Using transcriptomics and metabolic profiling approaches, we showed that the enhanced anti-tumor property of Th1/17 cells was dependent on the increased NAD+-dependent activity of the histone deacetylase Sirt1. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Sirt1 activity impaired the anti-tumor potential of Th1/17 cells. Importantly, T\u00a0cells with reduced surface expression of the NADase CD38 exhibited intrinsically higher NAD+, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, higher glutaminolysis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics that vastly improved tumor control. Lastly, blocking CD38 expression improved tumor control even when using Th0 anti-tumor T\u00a0cells.

In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections. Increased ratios of GvH to HvG clones were seen in non-rejectors, potentially mitigating the constant threat of rejection posed by HvG clones persisting within the tissue-resident graft T cell

"Abstract": "This brief article focuses on two aims: i) To investigate the in vitro pharmaco-dynamic interactions of combining synthetic potent microtubule targeting anticancer agent, Fludelone (FD) with cyto-protective agent, Panaxytriol (PXT) derived from Panax ginseng, and ii) To illustrate step-by-step operation for conducting two-drug combination in vitro using the combination index method, in terms of experimental design, data acquisition, computerized simulation and data interpretation. The Chou-Talalay method for drug combination is based on the median-effect equation, which provides the theoretical basis for the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation that allows quantitative determination of drug interactions, where CI<1, =1, and >1 indicates synergism, additive effect and antagonism, respectively. Based on these algorithms, computer software, CompySyn, is used for determining synergism and antagonism at all doses or effect levels simulated automatically. The use of Chou-Talalay's CI method in quantifying synergism or antagonism is increasing steadily during the past two decades, however, confusing questions and pitfalls were still frequently raised by insufficient understanding of the theory, especially reflected when researchers trying to use the computerized software to design and conduct experiments. In order to specifically address the confusions and to illustrate the practical features of this method, in this paper, a selected example is given based on our unpublished data regarding the combinational pharmacologic interactions of FD and PXT against the growth of breast cancer cell line MX-1. The step-by-step operation from experimental design to the real data analysis is illustrated. The results indicated that FD and PXT combination in vitro exerted synergistic effect when cell growth inhibition was greater than 45%, with CI ranged 0.836-0.609 for the fractional inhibition of Fa=0.50~0.90, as shown by the Fa-CI plot and by the isobologram. Thus, quantitative conclusion of synergism is obtained using the Chou-Talalay CI method, under the well-defined simple conditions for the FD and PXT combinations in vitro.", "Keywords": ["Fludelone", "combination index", "compusyn", "panaxytriol", "synergism quantification"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200126, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jia-Ning", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Chao", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "Preclinical Pharmacology Core, Molecular Pharmacology & Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer CenterNew York, NY 10065, USA; Present Address: PD Science LLCParamus, NJ 07652, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of cancer research", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26950421", "Title": "Metabolic reprogramming of alloantigen-activated T cells after hematopoietic cell transplantation.", "Abstract": "Alloreactive donor T cells are the driving force in the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), yet little is known about T cell metabolism in response to alloantigens after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

Specifically, we employed a murine allogeneic BM transplant model and determined that T cells switch from fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (FAO) and pyruvate oxidation via the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle to aerobic glycolysis, thereby increasing dependence upon glutaminolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis was required for optimal function of alloantigen-activated T cells and induction of GVHD, as inhibition of glycolysis by targeting mTORC1 or 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) ameliorated GVHD mortality and morbidity.

Given that recipient APCs are essential for priming allogeneic T cells and recipient NK or T cells are able to reject allogeneic donor cells, we evaluated the role of T-bet on the host in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) using murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. T-bet(-/-) recipients developed significantly milder GVHD than their wild type counterparts in MHC-mismatched or CD4-dependent minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched models. Allogeneic donor T cells, in particular, CD4 subset, significantly reduced IFN-\u03b3 production, proliferation and migration, and caused less injury in liver and gut of T-bet(-/-) recipients. We further observed that T-bet on recipient hematopoietic cells was primarily responsible for the donor T cell response and pathogenicity in GVHD. T-bet(-/-) dendritic cells expressed higher levels of Trail, whereas they produced lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12/23 p40, as well as chemokine CXCL9, resulting in significantly higher levels of apoptosis, less priming, and infiltration of donor T cells. Meanwhile, NK cells in T-bet(-/-) hosts partially contribute to the decreased donor T cell proliferation.

The miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes 6 miRs including 17, 18a, 19a, 20a, 19b-1, and 92-1, is among the best characterized of these miRs. The miR-17-92 cluster has been shown to regulate a variety of immune responses including infection, tumor, and autoimmunity, but the role of this cluster in T-cell response to alloantigens has not been previously explored. By using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched, -mismatched, and haploidentical murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), we demonstrate that the expression of miR-17-92 on donor T cells is essential for the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but dispensable for the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The miR-17-92 plays a major role in promoting CD4 T-cell activation, proliferation, survival, and Th1 differentiation, while inhibiting Th2 and iTreg differentiation. Alternatively, miR-17-92 may promote migration of CD8 T cells to GVHD target organs, but has minimal impact on CD8 T-cell proliferation, survival, or cytolytic function, which could contribute to the preserved GVL effect mediated by T cells deficient for miR-17-92. Furthermore, we evaluated a translational approach and found that systemic administration of antagomir to block miR-17 or miR-19b in this cluster significantly inhibited alloreactive T-cell expansion and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) production, and prolonged the survival in recipients afflicted with GVHD while preserving the GVL effect.

T-bet(-/-), but not IFN-\u03b3(-/-), CD4 T cells had a markedly reduced ability to cause tissue damage in liver and gut. This distinct outcome is reflected by the differential gene expression on donor CD4 T cells deficient for T-bet or IFN-\u03b3. At mRNA and protein levels, we defined several T-bet-dependent molecules that may account for the impaired ability of T-bet(-/-) T cells to migrate into target organs and to produce Th1-related cytokines. Moreover, these molecules were independent of either endogenous IFN-\u03b3, such as CXCR3 and programmed death-1, or systematic IFN-\u03b3, such as NKG2D, I-A(b), and granzyme B. Although both T-bet(-/-) and IFN-\u03b3(-/-) CD4 T cells are prone to differentiate into Th17 cells, polarized Th17 cells deficient for T-bet but not for IFN-\u03b3 had a significantly reduced ability to cause GVHD. Finally, T-bet(-/-) T cells had a compromised graft-versus-leukemia effect, which could be essentially reversed by neutralization of IL-17 in the recipients.
