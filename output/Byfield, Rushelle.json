[{"PMID": "38881045", "Title": "The Study of the Epidemiology of Pediatric Hypertension Registry (SUPERHERO): Rationale and Methods.", "Abstract": "Despite increasing prevalence of hypertension in youth and high adult cardiovascular mortality rates, the long-term consequences of youth-onset hypertension remain unknown. This is due to limitations of prior research such as small sample sizes, reliance on manual record review, and limited analytic methods that did not address major biases. The Study of the Epidemiology of Pediatric Hypertension (SUPERHERO) is a multisite retrospective Registry of youth evaluated by subspecialists for hypertension disorders. Sites obtain harmonized electronic health record data using standardized biomedical informatics scripts validated with randomized manual record review. Inclusion criteria are index visit for International Classification of Diseases Diagnostic Codes, 10th Revision (ICD-10 code)-defined hypertension disorder \u2265January 1, 2015 and age <19 years. We exclude patients with ICD-10 code-defined pregnancy, kidney failure on dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Data include demographics, anthropomorphics, U.S. Census Bureau tract, histories, blood pressure, ICD-10 codes, medications, laboratory and imaging results, and ambulatory blood pressure. SUPERHERO leverages expertise in epidemiology, statistics, clinical care, and biomedical informatics to create the largest and most diverse registry of youth with newly diagnosed hypertension disorders. SUPERHERO's goals are to (i) reduce CVD burden across the life course and (ii) establish gold-standard biomedical informatics methods for youth with hypertension disorders.", "Keywords": ["Biomedical Informatics", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Health", "Causal Inference", "Child Health", "Electronic Health Record", "Life Course", "Youth"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "South", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Victoria C", "Last Name": "Giammattei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kiri W", "Last Name": "Bagley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine Y", "Last Name": "Bakhoum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William H", "Last Name": "Beasley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Morgan B", "Last Name": "Bily", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shupti", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron M", "Last Name": "Bridges", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rushelle L", "Last Name": "Byfield", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica Fallon", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Chanchlani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashton", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lucy", "Last Name": "D'Agostino McGowan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen M", "Last Name": "Downs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gina M", "Last Name": "Fergeson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason H", "Last Name": "Greenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taylor A", "Last Name": "Hill-Horowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth T", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mahmoud", "Last Name": "Kallash", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Margret", "Last Name": "Kamel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stefan G", "Last Name": "Kiessling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Kline", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Laisure", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jackson", "Last Name": "Londeree", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caroline B", "Last Name": "Lucas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sai Sudha", "Last Name": "Mannemuddhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kuo-Rei", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jason M", "Last Name": "Misurac", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Margaret O", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James T", "Last Name": "Nugent", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Onugha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashna", "Last Name": "Pudupakkam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathy M", "Last Name": "Redmond", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sandeep", "Last Name": "Riar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine B", "Last Name": "Sethna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sahar", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashley L", "Last Name": "Thumann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Uss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol L", "Last Name": "Vincent", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irina V", "Last Name": "Viviano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Blanche D", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Woroniecki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ikuyo", "Last Name": "Yamaguchi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "Weaver", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of epidemiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun17"}, {"PMID": "37442816", "Title": "Antihypertensive medication nonadherence and target organ damage in children with chronic kidney disease.", "Abstract": "Nonadherence is common in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

This is an essential reaction for phospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life, and it is catalysed solely by CDP-APs. Here we report the 2.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a representative CDP-AP from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme (AF2299) is a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic domain. A polar cavity within the membrane accommodates the active site, lined with the residues from an absolutely conserved CDP-AP signature motif (D(1)xxD(2)G(1)xxAR...G(2)xxxD(3)xxxD(4)). Structures in the apo, CMP-bound, CDP-bound and CDP-glycerol-bound states define functional roles for each of these eight conserved residues and allow us to propose a sequential, base-catalysed mechanism universal for CDP-APs, in which the fourth aspartate (D4) acts as the catalytic base.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohols", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Archaeal Proteins", "Archaeoglobus fulgidus", "Binding Sites", "Biocatalysis", "Catalytic Domain", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giuliano", "Last Name": "Sciara", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2]."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2]."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Tomasek", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2]."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Kloss", "Affiliation": "New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure, New York Structural Biology Center, 89 Convent Avenue, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shantelle", "Last Name": "Tabuso", "Affiliation": "New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure, New York Structural Biology Center, 89 Convent Avenue, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rushelle", "Last Name": "Byfield", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Cohn", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Surajit", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, NE-CAT, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kanagalaghatta R", "Last Name": "Rajashankar", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, NE-CAT, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vesna", "Last Name": "Slavkovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Filippo", "Last Name": "Mancia", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2014Jun13"}]
