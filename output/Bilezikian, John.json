[{"PMID": "38676447", "Title": "Consensus Statement on Vitamin D Status Assessment and Supplementation: Whys, Whens, and Hows.", "Abstract": "The 6th International Conference, \"Controversies in Vitamin D,\" was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.", "Keywords": ["Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP)", "calcifediol",

This review is based upon all peer-reviewed papers, published in the English language with PubMed as the primary search engine. Recent preclinical studies have documented an effect of PTH to stimulate lipolysis in both adipocytes and liver cells and to cause browning of adipocytes. PTH also reduces bone marrow adiposity and hepatic steatosis. Although clinical studies are limited, disease models of PTH excess and PTH deficiency lend support to these preclinical findings.

Abnormalities in the parathyroid glands can be identified with various imaging modalities including ultrasound (US), sestamibi scan (MIBI), 4-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). While it is not uncommon for parathyroid pathology to be undetected on imaging, this is more typical of low-volume hyperplasia and smaller-sized adenomas. We present the case of a 65-year-old man with PHPT who initially had a solitary parathyroid mass detected by US, but who was ultimately discovered to have massive PH with hyperplastic glands not visualized on US or MIBI. This atypical presentation may help guide providers in decisions on ordering and interpreting various imaging modalities for patients with PHPT. In this case, 4D-CT was the only modality in which large hyperplastic glands were identified, suggesting superior sensitivity.

Currently, guidelines for 25(OH)D assessment and vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients, pre- and post-surgery, are still lacking. The aim of this work is to analyse systematically the published experience on 25(OH)D status and vitamin D supplementation, pre- and post-surgery, and to propose, on this basis, recommendations for management. Preoperatively, 18 studies including 2,869 patients were evaluated. Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency as defined by 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200930 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) was 85%, whereas when defined by 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200920 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was 57%. The median preoperative 25(OH)D level was 19.75 ng/mL. After surgery, 39 studies including 5,296 patients were analysed and among those undergoing either malabsorptive or restrictive procedures, a lower rate of vitamin D insufficiency and higher 25(OH)D levels postoperatively were observed in patients treated with high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation, defined as\u2009\u2265\u20092,000 IU/daily (mostly D3-formulation), compared with low-doses (<\u20092,000 IU/daily). Our recommendations based on this systematic review and meta-analysis should help clinical practice in the assessment and management of vitamin D status before and after bariatric surgery.

The scope of these meetings is to discuss controversial issues about vitamin D. Publication of the outcomes of the meeting in international journals allows a wide sharing of the most recent data with the medical and academic community. Vitamin D and malabsorptive gastrointestinal conditions was one of the topics discussed at the meeting and focus of this paper. Participants to the meeting were invited to review available literature on selected issues related to vitamin D and gastrointestinal system and to present their topic to all participants with the aim to initiate a discussion on the main outcomes of which are reported in this document. The presentations were focused on the possible bidirectional relationship between vitamin D and gastrointestinal malabsorptive conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and bariatric surgery. In fact, on one hand the impact of these conditions on vitamin D status was examined and on the other hand the possible role of hypovitaminosis D on pathophysiology and clinical course of these conditions was also evaluated. All examined malabsorptive conditions severely impair vitamin D status. Since vitamin D has known positive effects on bone this in turn may contribute to negative skeletal outcomes including reduced bone mineral density, and increased risk of fracture which may be mitigated by vitamin D supplementation. Due to the immune and metabolic extra-skeletal effects there is the possibility that low levels of vitamin D may negatively impact on the underlying gastrointestinal conditions worsening its clinical course or counteracting the effect of treatment. Therefore, vitamin D status assessment and supplementation should be routinely considered in all patients affected by these conditions. This concept is strengthened by the existence of a possible bidirectional relationship through which poor vitamin D status may negatively impact on clinical course of underlying disease. Sufficient elements are available to estimate the desired threshold vitamin D level above which a favourable impact on the skeleton in these conditions may be obtained. On the other hand, ad hoc controlled clinical trials are needed to better define this threshold for obtaining a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on occurrence and clinical course of malabsorptive gastrointestinal diseases.", "Keywords": ["Bariatric surgery", "Celiac disease", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Obesity", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D deficiency", "Vitamin D supplementation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency", "Fractures, Bone", "Bone and Bones", "Disease Progression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Giustina", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy. giustina.andrea@hsr.it."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "di Filippo", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Agnese", "Last Name": "Allora", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Daniel D", "Last Name": "Bikle", "Affiliation": "Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California San Francisco, 1700 Owens St, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giulia Martina", "Last Name": "Cavestro", "Affiliation": "Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit, Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Latella", "Affiliation": "Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Division, Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Minisola", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical, Internal, Anaesthesiological and Cardiovascular Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Nicola", "Last Name": "Napoli", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Unit of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Universit\u00e0 Campus Bio-Medico Di Roma, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Trasciatti", "Affiliation": "Galileo Research Srl, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Melin", "Last Name": "Uygur", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York City, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "36726204", "Title": "The Clinical and Skeletal Effects of Long-Term Therapy of Hypoparathyroidism With rhPTH(1-84).", "Abstract": "Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, low or absent parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, reduced bone remodeling, and high areal bone mineral density (aBMD). PTH is a therapeutic option, yet data on the prolonged clinical and skeletal effects of PTH treatment are limited. We tracked annual daily doses of calcium and active vitamin D supplements, calciotropic biochemistries, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and aBMD measurements in 27 HypoPT patients (16 postsurgical, 11 nonsurgical) who were treated with recombinant human PTH(1-84) [rhPTH(1-84)] for at least 8 (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and up to 12 (n\u00a0=\u00a014) years. We also performed high-resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) imaging and report results at baseline, 5, 8, and 12\u2009years of rhPTH(1-84) treatment. With prolonged use of rhPTH, reductions in the need for supplemental calcium and active vitamin D were maintained. The eGFR did not decline. Serum calcium was maintained within the lower limit of the normal range. aBMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) showed an increase at the lumbar spine and a decrease at the distal 1/3 radius. By HRpQCT, cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) at the tibia decreased at year 5: -20.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5%. The magnitude of this reduction was mitigated in year 8: -8.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6% and in year 12: -10.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2% but all were significantly below the mean baseline value (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A similar pattern of decline was observed at the radius. Cortical porosity progressively increased at the tibia in year 5: 17.4%\u2009\u00b1\u200910% (p\u2009<\u20090.05), year 8: 55.2%\u2009\u00b1\u200911% (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and year 12: 83.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200914% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A similar pattern of increase was observed at the radius. Failure load, which was higher than normal at baseline, decreased but remained above normal at year 12.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials to investigate the benefits and harms of PTH therapy and conventional therapy in the management of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. To identify eligible studies, published in English, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to May 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We defined patients' important outcomes and used grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) to provide the structure for quantifying absolute effects and rating the quality of evidence. Seven randomized trials of 12 publications that enrolled a total of 386 patients proved eligible. The follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 36\u00a0months. Compared with conventional therapy, PTH therapy probably achieves a small improvement in physical health-related quality of life (mean difference [MD] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-5.3, minimally important difference 3.0, moderate certainty). PTH therapy results in more patients reaching 50% or greater reduction in the dose of active vitamin D and calcium (relative risk [RR]\u00a0=\u20096.5, 95% CI 2.5-16.4, 385 more per 1000 patients, high certainty). PTH therapy may increase hypercalcemia (RR\u00a0=2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.04, low certainty). The findings may support the use of PTH therapy in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Because of limitations of short duration and small sample size, evidence from randomized trials is limited regarding important benefits of PTH therapy compared with conventional therapy. Establishing such benefits will require further studies. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

However, it is not uncommon for osteoporotic fractures to occur in men. About 40% of fractures occur in men with an incidence that has increased over the years. After a first fracture, the risk of a subsequent episode, as well as the risk of death, is higher in the male than in the female population. Despite these facts, only 10% of men with osteoporosis receive adequate treatment. Up to half of the cases of male osteoporosis have a secondary cause, the most common being hypogonadism, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic use of glucocorticoids. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommends using the female database for the diagnosis of osteoporosis by DXA (T-score \u2264 -2.5 in men over 50 years old). In addition, osteoporosis can also be diagnosed independently of the BMD if a fragility fracture is present, or if there is a high risk of fractures by FRAX. Treatment is similar to postmenopausal osteoporosis, because the data regarding changes in bone density track closely to those in women.

Measuring serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels early after total thyroidectomy may predict the development of chronic hypoparathyroidism. The study aimed (i) to identify symptoms and complications associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism and determine the prevalence of those symptoms and complications (Part I), and (ii) to examine the utility of early postoperative measurements of PTH and calcium in predicting chronic hypoparathyroidism (Part II). We searched Medline, Medline In-Process, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify complications and symptoms associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism. We used two predefined criteria (at least three studies reported the complication and symptom and had statistically significantly greater pooled relative estimates). To estimate prevalence, we used the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the studies reporting complications and symptoms. For testing the predictive values of early postoperative measurements of PTH and calcium, we used a bivariate model to perform diagnostic test meta-analysis. In Part I, the 93 eligible studies enrolled a total of 18,973 patients and reported on 170 complications and symptoms. We identified nine most common complications or symptoms probably associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism. The complications or symptoms and the prevalence are as follows: nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis (median prevalence among all studies 15%), renal insufficiency (12%), cataract (17%), seizures (11%), arrhythmia (7%), ischemic heart disease (7%), depression (9%), infection (11%), and all-cause mortality (6%). In Part II, 18 studies with 4325 patients proved eligible. For PTH measurement, regarding the posttest probability, PTH values above 10\u2009pg/mL 12-24\u2009hours postsurgery virtually exclude chronic hypoparathyroidism irrespective of pretest probability (100%). When PTH values are below 10\u2009pg/mL, posttest probabilities range from 3% to 64%. Nine complications and symptoms are probably associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism. A PTH value above a threshold of 10\u2009pg/mL 12-24\u2009hours after total thyroidectomy is a strong predictor that the patients will not develop chronic hypoparathyroidism. Patients with PTH values below the threshold need careful monitoring as some will develop chronic hypoparathyroidism. \u00a9 2022 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).", "Keywords": ["ASSOCIATION STUDIES", "DISORDERS OF CALCIUM/PHOSPHATE METABOLISM", "EPIDEMIOLOGY", "GENETIC RESEARCH", "HUMAN", "HYPOPARATHYROIDISM", "PARATHYROID-RELATED DISORDERS"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Calcium", "Retrospective Studies", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Bone and Bones", "Postoperative Complications", "Hypocalcemia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Evidence-Based Social Sciences Research Center/Health Technology Assessment Center, School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Meixuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Evidence-Based Social Sciences Research Center/Health Technology Assessment Center, School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Muneeb", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "Michael G.

Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis, close monitoring is required during these periods with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

The goals of management for chronic HypoPT include improvement in QoL and the prevention of both hypo- and hypercalcemia symptoms and long-term complications. Several groups have provided consensus statements and guidelines on the management of HypoPT; however, due to limited evidence, these recommendations have largely been based on literature reviews, expert opinion, and consensus statements. The objective of this study was to use a systematic approach to describe current practice for the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. We developed a survey asking experts in the field to select the responses that best reflect their current practice. The survey found no differences in responses between nonsurgical and postsurgical patient assessment. For new patients, respondents usually performed an assessment of serum lab profile (calcium [either albumin-adjusted or ionized], magnesium, creatinine, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D), 24-hour urine (creatinine,\u00a0calcium), and a renal ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. For follow-up patients, most respondents perform blood tests and urine tests every 6\u2009months or less frequently. The reported clinical practice patterns for monitoring for complications of chronic HypoPT vary considerably among respondents. Based on the responses in this systematic expert practice survey, we provide practice suggestions for initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. In addition, we highlight areas with significant variation in practice and identify important areas for future research. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

To provide the most current summary of these developments, an international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT. For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Grading\u2009of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, give the most complete information available to date. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a summary statement and revised guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Grading\u2009of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for >12\u00a0months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24\u00a0hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH >\u200910\u2009pg/mL (1.05\u2009pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40\u2009years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Because uncertainty remains regarding both medical and surgical therapy, this systematic review addresses the efficacy and safety of medical therapy in asymptomatic patients or symptomatic patients who decline surgery and surgery in asymptomatic patients. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed from inception to December 2020, and included randomized controlled trials in patients with PHPT that compared nonsurgical management with medical therapy versus without medical therapy and surgery versus no surgery in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. For surgical complications we included observational studies. Paired reviewers addressed eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data for patient-important outcomes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals and used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence for each outcome. For medical therapy, 11 trials reported in 12 publications including 438 patients proved eligible: three addressed alendronate, one denosumab, three cinacalcet, two vitamin D, and two estrogen therapy. Alendronate, denosumab, vitamin D, and estrogen therapy all increased bone density. Cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Cinacalcet and vitamin D may have a small or no increase in overall adverse events. Very-low-quality evidence raised the possibility of an increase in serious adverse events with alendronate and denosumab. The trials also provided low-quality evidence for increased bleeding and mastalgia with estrogen therapy. For surgery, six trials presented in 12 reports including 441 patients proved eligible. Surgery achieved biochemical cure in 96.1% (high quality). We found no convincing evidence supporting an impact of surgery on fracture, quality of life, occurrence of kidney stones, and renal function, but the evidence proved low or very low quality. Surgery was associated with an increase in bone mineral density. For patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT, who are not candidates for parathyroid surgery, cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and PTH levels; anti-resorptives increased bone density. For patients with asymptomatic PHPT, surgery usually achieves biochemical cure. These results can help to inform patients and clinicians regarding use of medical therapy and surgery in PHPT. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

While features such as kidney stones and skeletal disease are often highlighted as directly related to the disease, others can be even more prevalent. For example, cognitive dysfunction and reduced quality of life are common complaints in many patients, even among those who are classified as being asymptomatic. The pathophysiology of PHPT involves the impact of excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) on calcium metabolism. Referencing putative neurocognitive issues, many animal studies have illustrated the potential roles of PTH and PTH receptors in the brain. Functional imaging and pre-and post-parathyroidectomy studies have suggested a link between the neuronal impact of elevated PTH levels on specific functional aspects of the central nervous system, such as cognition. Confounding a direct role for PTH are hypercalcemia and vitamin D deficiency, both of which could conceivably alter CNS function in PHPT. The lack of strong evidence that parathyroidectomy improves cognition in patients with PHPT raises the question as to whether parathyroid surgery should be recommended on this basis alone.

The use of calcium citrate (Ca-Cit) theoretically could have a positive impact on the nephrolithiasis risk because citrate salts are used to reduce this risk. Our objective was to evaluate the potential therapeutic advantage of Ca-Cit in comparison with calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) in HypoPT, on nephrolithiasis risk factors, as well as to their ability to maintain desirable serum calcium levels. We also evaluated these preparations on quality of life (QOL). This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruited 24 adults with postsurgical chronic hypoparathyroidism at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome. Participants were randomized 1:1 to Ca-Cit or CaCO3 for 1 month and then crossed over to the other treatment for another month. The primary outcomes were changes in albumin-adjusted serum calcium and in ion activity product of calcium oxalate levels (AP[CaOx] index). Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in SF-36 survey score, fatigue score, constipation, and adverse events. No difference in terms of AP(CaOx) index was observed between the two groups. However, Ca-Cit was associated with a significant reduction in the oxalate/creatinine ratio compared with CaCO3 (-2.46\u2009mmol/mol [SD 11.93] versus 7.42\u2009mmol/mol [SD 17.63], p\u00a0=\u00a00.029). Serum calcium and phosphorus concentration was not different between the two calcium preparations. Ca-Cit was associated with less constipation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). No difference was found in QOL scores. Although Ca-Cit did not modify the AP(CaOx) index when compared with CaCO3, it was associated with a reduction in urinary oxalate excretion that could have a potential beneficial effect on nephrolithiasis risk.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Library were searched for published articles (from database inception to Sept 2020). All double-blind RCTs and cohort studies that reported data on the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet therapy in individuals\u2009\u2265\u200918 with PHPT were included. Random effect meta-analysis was performed to estimate the efficacy of cinacalcet in lowering serum calcium and PTH levels compared with placebo. 4 RCTs (177 participants) and 17 cohort studies (763 participants) were eligible for final analysis. Pooled results from the RCTs suggest that, when compared to placebo and administered for up to 28\u00a0weeks, cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium (\u2264\u200910.3\u00a0mg/dl) in patients with PHPT [RR 20 (95% CI 6.04 - 68.52, I2\u2009=\u20090%, pheterogeneity\u2009<\u20090\u00b700001)]. Serum PTH levels decreased significantly after 2\u00a0weeks and up to 28\u00a0weeks after treatment with cinacalcet. In the pooled analysis of the 17 cohort studies, serum calcium levels normalized in 76% (95% CI 66% to 86%; I2\u2009=\u200992%, pheterogeneity\u2009<\u20090\u00b700001) of patients regardless of the duration of treatment. In most studies, PTH levels decreased by 13% to 55%. No RCT reported on BMD as a primary or secondary outcome, and no improvement in BMD was noted in the 2 non-randomized studies that reported densitometric findings. No significant difference in urinary calcium was noted with cinacalcet therapy in either the RCTs or non-randomized studies. There was no significant difference in overall adverse events (AE) (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.26) compared to placebo noted in the RCTs. In the non-randomized studies, pooled weighted AE rate was 45% (95% CI 32 to 59%). Risk of bias was low in 2/4 RCTs and 6/17cohort studies; risk was intermediate in 2/4 RCTs and 8/17 cohort studies, and risk was high in 3/17 cohort studies. In PHPT, cinacalcet lowers serum calcium and PTH with greater effects on calcium than on PTH in the short term. In the doses reported, the drug is safe with tolerable side effects.

Since vitamin D has a crucial role in skeletal and extra-skeletal systems, the aim of the Conference was to discuss improved management of vitamin D dosing, therapeutic levels and form or route of administration in the general population and in different clinical conditions. A tailored approach, based on the specific mechanisms underlying vitamin D deficiency in different diseases that were discussed, was recommended. Specifically, in comparison to healthy populations, higher levels of vitamin D and greater amounts of vitamin D were deemed necessary in osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity (particularly after bariatric surgery), and in those treated with glucocorticoids. Emerging and still open issues were related to target vitamin D levels and the role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 since low vitamin D may predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to worse COVID-19 outcomes. Finally, whereas oral daily cholecalciferol appears to be the preferred choice for vitamin D supplementation in the general population, and in most clinical conditions, active vitamin D analogs may be indicated in patients with hypoparathyroidism and severe kidney and liver insufficiency. Parenteral vitamin D administration could be helpful in malabsorption syndromes or in states of vitamin D resistance.Specific guidelines for desired levels of vitamin D should be tailored to the different conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism with the goal to define disease-specific normative values.", "Keywords": ["Bone", "COVID-19", "Extraskeletal effects", "Obesity", "Parathyroid hormone", "Vitamin D"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Cholecalciferol", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology Division, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna Maria", "Last Name": "Formenti", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, San Raffaele, Vita-Salute University and IRCCS Hospital, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Adler", "Affiliation": "McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Binkley", "Affiliation": "University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Bouillon", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, Department of chronic diseases, metabolism and ageing, Leuven, KU, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Marise", "Last Name": "Lazaretti-Castro", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Escola Paulista de Medicina - Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Claudio", "Last Name": "Marcocci", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Nicola", "Last Name": "Napoli", "Affiliation": "Unit of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Rizzoli", "Affiliation": "Service of Bone Diseases, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Giustina", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Sciences, San Raffaele, Vita-Salute University and IRCCS Hospital, Milano, Italy. giustina.andrea@hsr.it."}], "Journal": "Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders", "PubDate": "2021Dec"}, {"PMID": "34785102", "Title": "Proceedings of the 2021 Santa Fe Bone Symposium: Advances in the Management of Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases.", "Abstract": "The 2021 Virtual Santa Fe Bone Symposium was held August 5-8, with over 300 registered attendees from throughout the USA, and at least 18 other countries.

Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "COVID-19", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Patient Advocacy", "SARS-CoV-2", "Syndrome", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "Venous Thromboembolism"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ani", "Last Name": "Nalbandian", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kartik", "Last Name": "Sehgal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

complications in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism managed with conventional therapy. Methodology was consistent with the recommendations outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Peer-reviewed journal articles with specified medical subject heading terms were identified using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Data were extracted from eligible articles based on prespecified parameters for clinical outcomes of renal calcifications and disease. Because of the heterogeneity of the data, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. From 1200 potentially relevant articles, data were extracted from 13 manuscripts that reported data for \u22651 of the 19 predefined renal outcomes for \u226510 adult patients (n\u2009=\u200911 manuscripts) or pediatric patients (n\u2009=\u20092 manuscripts). The collective data provide evidence that adult and pediatric patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism and treated with conventional therapy (oral calcium and active vitamin D) had an increased risk of renal complications. The reported rate of nephrolithiasis was up to 36%, with the lowest rates in studies reporting shorter duration of disease. The rate of nephrocalcinosis was up to 38%. Some studies reported a combined nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis outcome of 19% to 31%. Data for renal disease that encompassed a range of renal insufficiency to chronic kidney disease were reported in 10 articles; the reported rates ranged from 2.5% to 41%. In patients who receive long-term treatment with oral calcium and active vitamin D, chronic hypoparathyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of renal complications compared with the general population.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Nephrocalcinosis", "Nephrolithiasis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Calcium, Dietary", "Child", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Nephrolithiasis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elvira O", "Last Name": "Gosmanova", "Affiliation": "Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pascal", "Last Name": "Houillier", "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Rejnmark", "Affiliation": "Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Claudio", "Last Name": "Marelli", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 W 168th Street, Room 864, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jpb2@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33567075", "Title": "Vertebral Fracture Assessment in Postmenopausal Women With Postsurgical Hypoparathyroidism.", "Abstract": "Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder whose skeletal features include suppression of bone turnover and greater volume and width of the trabecular compartment.

The conference was held as a follow-up to previous meetings held in 2017 and 2018 to address topics of controversy in vitamin D research. The specific topics were selected by the steering committee of the conference and based upon areas that remain controversial from the preceding conferences. Other topics were selected anew that reflect specific topics that have surfaced since the last international conference. Consensus was achieved after formal presentations and open discussions among experts. As will be detailed in this article, consensus was achieved with regard to the following: the importance and prevalence of nutritional rickets, amounts of vitamin D that are typically generated by sun exposure, worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, the importance of circulating concentrations of 25OHD as the best index of vitamin D stores, definitions and thresholds of vitamin D deficiency, and efficacy of vitamin D analogues in the treatment of psoriasis. Areas of uncertainly and controversy include the following: daily doses of vitamin D needed to maintain a normal level of 25OHD in the general population, recommendations for supplementation in patients with metabolic bone diseases, cutaneous production of vitamin D by UVB exposure, hepatic regulation of 25OHD metabolites, definition of vitamin D excess, vitamin D deficiency in acute illness, vitamin D requirements during reproduction, potential for a broad spectrum of cellular and organ activities under the influence of the vitamin D receptor, and potential links between vitamin D and major human diseases. With specific regard to the latter area, the proceedings of the conference led to recommendations for areas in need of further investigation through appropriately designed intervention trials. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Society guidelines have recommended which populations may benefit from DXA screening and the use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to guide decisions regarding pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis. According to the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, postmenopausal women and men at least 50 y old with osteopenic BMD warrant pharmacologic treatment if they have a FRAX-calculated 10-y probability of at least 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with osteoporosis defined by a clinical event, namely a fragility fracture, or with an osteoporotic BMD should also be treated. Patients who are treated for osteoporosis should be monitored regularly to track expected gains in BMD by serial DXA scans. With some drug therapies, BMD targets can be reached whereby further improvements in BMD are not associated with further reductions in fracture risk. Although reaching this target might suggest a stopping point for therapy, the reversibility of most treatments for osteoporosis, except for the bisphosphonates, has dampened enthusiasm for this approach. In the case of denosumab, it is now apparent that stopping therapy at any point can lead to an increase in multiple-fracture risk. For patients who do not respond to antiosteoporosis pharmacologic therapy with an improvement in BMD, or who have an incident fragility fracture on therapy, secondary causes of osteoporosis or non-compliance with medical therapy should be considered.", "Keywords": ["DXA", "FRAX", "bone mineral density", "fracture risk", "osteoporosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Density", "Humans", "Osteoporosis", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Risk Assessment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine N", "Last Name": "Haseltine", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tariq", "Last Name": "Chukir", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Pinar J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin T", "Last Name": "Jacob", "Affiliation": "Molecular Imaging and Therapy Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Azeez", "Last Name": "Farooki", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York farookia@mskcc.org."}], "Journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "PubDate": "2021Apr"}, {"PMID": "33200346", "Title": "Skeletal abnormalities in Hypoparathyroidism and in Primary Hyperparathyroidism.", "Abstract": "Both hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), as well as its pathological counterpart, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), can lead to skeletal abnormalities. Chronic deficiency of PTH in patients with HypoPT is associated with a profound reduction in bone remodeling, with consequent increases in bone density, and abnormalities in microarchitecture and bone strength. It is still not clear whether there is an increase in fracture risk in HypoPT. While standard therapy with calcium supplements and active vitamin D does not restore bone homeostasis, treatment of HypoPT with PTH appears to correct some of those abnormalities. In PHPT, the continuous exposure to high levels of PTH causes an increase in bone remodeling, in which bone resorption prevails. In the symptomatic form of PHPT, patients can present with fragility fractures, and/or the classical radiological features of osteitis fibrosa cystica. However, even in mild PHPT, catabolic skeletal actions of PTH are evident through reduced BMD, deterioration of bone microarchitecture and increased risk of fragility fractures. Successful parathyroidectomy improves skeletal abnormalities.

Fragility fractures, especially hip fractures, are associated with a significant reduction in the physical function and quality of life of affected patients, as well as increased mortality, leading to a major financial impact on health care. Many drugs have been registered for the treatment of osteoporosis and very recently, a new anabolic agent, romosozumab, has been approved in some countries. Despite the expansion of efficacious antiresorptive and anabolic therapies in recent years, a concomitant increase in concerns have been raised by physicians, patients and the lay press about the potential for adverse events, especially atypical femoral fractures (AFF) following prolonged use of bisphosphonates. Whatever the mechanism(s) may be, direct or indirect, linking prolonged bisphosphonate use to atypical femoral fractures, this adverse event is very rare in comparison to the magnitude of risk reduction of typical osteoporotic fractures. An estimated 162 osteoporosis-related fractures are prevented for each atypical femoral fracture associated with an anti-resorptive medication. Until a risk calculator for predicting risk of atypical fractures, becomes available in clinical practice, and we view this as an unlikely scenario, it is up to the physician to consider continuing or discontinuing bisphosphonate use after the critical 3-5 year period of treatment with zoledronic acid or alendronate, but close monitoring for the residual bone effects overtime should be planned. For other bisphosphonates, in which no residual effects are expected, drug holiday is usually not applied.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alendronate", "Bone Density Conservation Agents", "Diphosphonates", "Female", "Humans", "Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal", "Quality of Life"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francisco", "Last Name": "Bandeira", "Affiliation": "Hospital Agamenon Magalh\u00e3es, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brasil."}, {"First Name": "Wesdrey", "Last Name": "Dantas", "Affiliation": "Hospital Agamenon Magalh\u00e3es, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brasil."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Archives of endocrinology and metabolism", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32651579", "Title": "Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Although COVID-19 is most well known for causing substantial respiratory pathology, it can also result in several extrapulmonary manifestations.

The majority of patients (62%) took rhPTH(1-84) 100\u2009\u03bcg every other day for the majority of the 4\u2009years. At 48\u2009months, areal bone density increased at the lumbar spine (+4.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%) and femoral neck (+2.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%), with declines at the total hip (-2.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8%) and ultradistal radius (-2.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%) (p\u2009<\u2009.05 for all). By HR-pQCT, at the radius site, very similar to the ultradistal DXA site, total volumetric BMD declined from baseline but remained above normative values at 48\u2009months (Z-score\u2009+\u20090.56). Cortical volumetric BMD was lower than normative controls at baseline at the radius and tibia (Z-scores -1.28 and\u2009-\u20091.69, respectively) and further declined at 48\u2009months (-2.13 and\u2009-\u20092.56, respectively). Cortical porosity was higher than normative controls at baseline at the tibia (Z-score\u2009+\u20090.72) and increased through 48\u2009months of therapy at both sites (Z-scores +1.80 and\u2009+\u20091.40, respectively). Failure load declined from baseline at both the radius and tibia, although remained higher than normative controls at 48\u2009months (Z-scores +1.71 and\u2009+\u20091.17, respectively). This is the first report of noninvasive high-resolution imaging in a cohort of hypoparathyroid patients treated with any PTH therapy for this length of time. The results give insights into the effects of long-term rhPTH(1-84) in hypoparathyroidism. \u00a9 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE MICROARCHITECTURE", "HIGH-RESOLUTION PERIPHERAL QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (HR-PQCT)", "HYPOPARATHYROIDISM"], "MeSH terms": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adult", "Bone Density", "Bone and Bones", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Radius", "Tibia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sanchita", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gaia", "Last Name": "Tabacco", "Affiliation": "Unit of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Donovan", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Rukshana", "Last Name": "Majeed", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Omeragic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2020Jul"}, {"PMID": "31956848", "Title": "Vitamin D: Giveth to Those Who Needeth.", "Abstract": "Severe vitamin D deficiency may cause rickets. While this point is not disputed, the use of vitamin D in the elderly to prevent fractures has been challenged recently by a meta-analysis of 81 RCTs, suggesting that the effects of vitamin D were trivial. As is true for any review of the literature, the interpretation of a meta-analysis can be confounded by the choice of publications to include or exclude. Indeed, the authors excluded RCTs with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation, included futile studies of very short duration, or studies with high bolus doses known to transiently increase fracture risk. The best available data show that calcium and vitamin D supplementation of elderly subjects can decrease the risk of hip and other non-vertebral fractures, especially in institutionalized subjects or elderly subjects with poor calcium and vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with many chronic diseases. The VIDA and VITAL trials did not show a protective effect on cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The D2d study also did not influence the progress of prediabetes to diabetes. However, the baseline 25OHD concentrations of the majority of the participants of all these trials were essentially normal. Post-hoc analysis of these studies suggest some possibly beneficial health outcomes in vitamin D deficient subjects. A meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D could partly prevent upper respiratory infections. Mendelian randomization studies suggest a causal link between lifelong low vitamin D status and multiple sclerosis. A vitamin D supplement in pregnant women may decrease maternal morbidity and improve the health of their offspring. Better-designed studies are needed to answer all outstanding questions. However, based on all available data, it seems that correction of vitamin D and/or calcium deficiency of infants, pregnant women and elderly subjects can improve their health. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Patients with serum creatinine >2.0\u2009mg/dL or 1.5-2.0\u2009mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <37\u2009mL/min, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula, were excluded.Results: At baseline, 660 patients had eGFR \u226590\u2009mL/min, 1276 had 60 to \u02c290\u2009mL/min, and 527 had <60\u2009mL/min.

Being naturally deficient in iodine, Armenia launched a national universal salt iodization (USI) strategy in 2004. Although high rates of goiter continued to be reported, iodine status has not been studied since 2005. Therefore, this study sought to assess the current situation of population iodine nutrition in Armenia. Methods: We used a selective cross-sectional model to recruit three groups: school-age children (SAC), pregnant women (PW), and nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) from each province. We collected casual urine and table salt samples from each participant, which were analyzed for iodine concentration. A repeat urine sample was collected in a subset of participants to adjust the results for within-person variation in iodine concentration. Group-wise urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) were compared with international reference criteria for iodine status. Results: Urine samples were collected from 1,125 participants from 13 different towns in Armenia; a total of 1,078 participants were included in the final analysis: 361 SAC (mean age, 10.5 years, 46.6% female), 356 PW (mean age, 26.1 years), and 361 WRA (mean age, 35.5 years). Population and geographically weighted median UIC were: SAC, 242 \u03bcg/L ([25th percentile] 203 to [75th percentile] 289 \u03bcg/L); PW, 226 \u03bcg/L (209 to 247 \u03bcg/L); WRA, 311 \u03bcg/L (244 to 371 \u03bcg/L). A total of 1,041 table salt samples were sufficient for laboratory analysis: 973 (93.4%) of the salt iodine measurements were within the national standard range of 40 \u00b1 15 mg/kg. Conclusion: The results of household salt sampling indicated a successful USI strategy. While the present study did not achieve a truly representative sample of Armenia's population, the UIC results support the conclusion that iodine deficiency has not recurred and is not an underlying factor for any remaining high goiter prevalence in Armenia.

At the radius, Tb. number was lower and spacing greater in Chinese women from HK and the US versus white women, whereas Chinese women did not differ from each other. Tb. thickness was highest in Chinese women from HK, intermediate in Chinese-Americans, and lowest in white women. Chinese women had more trabecular plates versus white women, leading to greater age- and BMI-adjusted stiffness for premenopausal Chinese women in HK and the US (both p < 0.05) versus white women. Tibial differences were similar in premenopausal women; analogous trends in microstructure were present in postmenopausal women at the tibia, although stiffness did not differ. In contrast, at the radius, cortical, plate-to-rod ratio, and stiffness were similar between postmenopausal HK and white women. Adjusting for age, weight, and height rather than age and BMI tended to reduce differences in bone size and Tb. parameters but accentuate cortical differences such that Chinese premenopausal women in both locations and postmenopausal women from HK had higher stiffness at both skeletal sites compared with white women. Compared with white women, Chinese women in the US and HK have vBMD and microstructural advantages leading to higher or similar mechanical competence in pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively, despite smaller bone size.", "Keywords": ["CHINESE", "HONG KONG", "HR\u2010pQCT", "ITS", "MICROARCHITECTURE", "RACE", "WHITE WOMEN"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Sum", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology Department of Medicine New York University Langone Health Medical Center New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy Y", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Bone Quality and Health Assessment Center of the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology the Chinese University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory Department of Biomedical Engineering Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science Columbia University New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhendong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery First Affiliated Hospital School of Medicine Shihezi University Shihezi China."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology Department of Medicine Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory Department of Biomedical Engineering Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science Columbia University New York NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Bone Quality and Health Assessment Center of the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology the Chinese University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR PR China."}, {"First Name": "Marcella", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology Department of Medicine Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons New York NY USA."}], "Journal": "JBMR plus", "PubDate": "2019Apr"}, {"PMID": "30950086", "Title": "Drugs for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Density Conservation Agents", "Bone Diseases", "Bone Remodeling", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Osteoporosis", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew T", "Last Name": "Drake", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology and Kogod Center of Aging, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "Mellanby Centre for Bone Research, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York."}], "Journal": "British journal of clinical pharmacology", "PubDate": "2019Jun"}, {"PMID": "30835187", "Title": "Diagnostic Performance of 4D CT and Sestamibi SPECT/CT in Localizing Parathyroid Adenomas in Primary Hyperparathyroidism.", "Abstract": "Background There currently is no consensus on the optimal localization procedure and imaging protocol for parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid four-dimensional (4D) CT has emerged as a promising method for preoperative localization. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of parathyroid 4D CT and technetium 99m-sestamibi (hereafter, referred to as sestamibi) SPECT/CT in preoperative localization in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Materials and Methods This was a single-institution retrospective study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent a combined imaging protocol of sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT (noncontrast, contrast agent-enhanced, arterial, and delayed venous phases) acquired in a single setting from February 2013 to May 2016, with subsequent parathyroidectomy within 6 months. Reference standard for correct localization was on the basis of location denoted on operative reports, with pathologic confirmation of parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. By using a four-quadrant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for localization of the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland or glands at sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT were compared, per modality and in combination. Results Four hundred patients (319 women, 81 men; mean age, 61 years \u00b1 14 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. Similar diagnostic performance was found in both combined 4D CT with sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT alone (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.90] and 0.87 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.90], respectively; P = .82). Both modalities outperformed sestamibi SPECT/CT (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.81; P < .001). Four-dimensional CT showed higher sensitivity than did sestamibi SPECT/CT (sensitivity, 79.3% [414 of 522] vs 58.0% [303 of 522], respectively; P < .001). In a subset analysis, 4D CT had higher sensitivity than sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single-gland disease (sensitivity, 92.5% [297 of 321] vs 75.1% [241 of 321], respectively; P < .001) and with multigland disease (sensitivity, 58.2% [117 of 201] vs 30.8% [62 of 201], respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Four-dimensional CT provided superior preoperative localization compared with sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single and multigland disease. The combination of the two modalities did not improve diagnostic performance compared with four-dimensional CT alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

In the 50 years that have elapsed since then, the BPs have become the leading drugs for the treatment of skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone resorption, including Paget's disease of bone, bone metastases, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis and several childhood inherited disorders. The discovery and development of the BPs as a major class of drugs for the treatment of bone diseases is a paradigm for the successful journey from \"bench to bedside and back again\". Several of the leading BPs achieved \"blockbuster\" status as branded drugs. However, these BPs have now come to the end of their patent life, making them highly affordable. The opportunity for new clinical applications for BPs also exists in other areas of medicine such as ageing, cardiovascular disease and radiation protection. Their use as inexpensive generic medicines is therefore likely to continue for many years to come. Fifty years of research into the pharmacology of bisphosphonates have led to a fairly good understanding about how these drugs work and how they can be used safely in patients with metabolic bone diseases. However, while we seemingly know much about these drugs, a number of key aspects related to BP distribution and action remain incompletely understood.

Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient elderly subjects. VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects. These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties. From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D status can be optimized to improve many aspects of human health. Vitamin D deficiency enhances the risk of osteoporotic fractures and is associated with many diseases.

TPTD is a 34-amino acid fragment that is identical in its primary sequence to the 34 amino acids of full-length human parathyroid hormone [hPTH(1-84)]. ABL is identical to parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) through the first 22 residues with significantly different amino acids inserted thereafter, between residues 22 and 34. The osteoanabolic actions of PTH are due directly to its effects on cells of the osteoblast lineage and indirectly by stimulating IGF-I synthesis and suppressing sclerostin and associated enhancement of Wnt signalling. Both TPTD and ABL are ligands that bind to and activate the PTH receptor type 1 (PTHR1) receptor but they appear to do so differently: ABL favours the transient, more anabolic configuration of the receptor. Both TPTD and ABL reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and non-vertebral fractures. Both drugs are administered for a maximum of 24 months, and should be followed by an antiresorptive agent to maintain gains in bone mineral density (BMD). Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin, appears to have dual actions by stimulating bone formation and reducing bone resorption. In the pivotal clinical trial, romosozumab, administered as a 210\u00a0mg monthly subcutaneous dose, significantly reduced new vertebral fractures and in a subsequent study reduced both vertebral and

bone score (TBS) in hypoparathyroidism over a 2-year treatment period. Studies in osteoporosis have shown that with PTH(1-34) there is a significant increase in LS aBMD and TBS. In this article, we provide new data comparing the effects of the same form of PTH, namely recombinant human PTH, rhPTH(1-84), on aBMD and TBS in hypoparathyroid and osteoporotic patients over an 18-month treatment period. We studied 19 premenopausal (mean age 45.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8 years) and 16 postmenopausal (71\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4 years) hypoparathyroid women and 38 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (71\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 years). DXA (hologic) at LS, femoral neck, total hip, and distal one-third radius was assessed. Site-matched LS TBS data were extracted from deidentified spine DXA scans using the TBS iNsight software (version 2.1; Medimaps, Geneva, Switzerland). We observed a significant increase in LS aBMD in premenopausal and postmenopausal hypoparathyroid (3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.02 and 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) and osteoporosis (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) patients after 18 months. There was a significant increase (3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.05) in TBS in premenopausal hypoparathyroid patients. A change in TBS was not observed in either postmenopausal group. One-third radius aBMD significantly declined in postmenopausal hypoparathyroid (-3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and osteoporosis (-8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) patients. Overall, there was a significantly greater increase in TBS in premenopausal hypoparathyroid than in osteoporosis patients (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) after adjusting for baseline values, age, BMI, and average daily dose of rhPTH(1-84). Comparing only postmenopausal women, the LS aBMD increase was greater in osteoporotic than hypoparathyroid subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Our results demonstrate that rhPTH(1-84) administered for 18 months increases trabecular aBMD in hypoparathyroidism and postmenopausal osteoporosis with greater gains observed in the subjects with osteoporosis. The data suggest different effects of PTH on bone depending on the baseline skeletal structure, skeletal dynamics, compartments, and menopausal status. \u00a9 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE MINERAL DENSITY", "HYPOPARATHYROIDISM", "MICROARCHITECTURE", "OSTEOPOROSIS", "PARATHYROID HORMONE"], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Density", "Cancellous Bone", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Recombinant Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cristiana", "Last Name": "Cipriani", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Disciplines, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Pepe", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Disciplines, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Barbara C", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Santa Casa de Belo Horizonte, and Felicio Rocho Hospital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luciano", "Last Name": "Nieddu", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Economics, UNINT University, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Maurizio", "Last Name": "Angelozzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Disciplines, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Federica", "Last Name": "Biamonte", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Disciplines, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Daniele", "Last Name": "Diacinti", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Hans", "Affiliation": "Center of Bone Diseases, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Minisola", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Disciplines, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2018Dec"}, {"PMID": "30070413", "Title": "AHNS Series: Do you know your guidelines?

We therefore studied histomorphometric changes with transiliac crest bone biopsies before and after 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091 years of rhPTH(1-84) in 13 hypoparathyroid subjects compared with 45 controls. Before institution of rhPTH(1-84), skeletal remodeling indices were markedly suppressed. With long-term treatment, indices of bone remodeling increased. Mineralizing surface increased by 26-fold (0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091 to 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097%, p\u2009=\u20090.003), bone formation rate increased by 15-fold (0.003\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 to 0.047\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009\u03bcm2 /\u03bcm/day, p\u2009=\u20090.007), osteoid width doubled (1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091 to 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091 lamellae, p\u2009=\u20090.017), and osteoid surface tripled (3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093 to 10.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096%, p\u2009=\u20090.011). Bone resorption as measured by eroded surface increased (4.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092 to 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093%, p\u2009=\u20090.021). Structural changes demonstrated intratrabecular tunneling, with increases in cancellous bone volume (19.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095 to 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911%, p\u2009=\u20090.017) and trabecular number (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091 to 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091 #/mm, p\u2009=\u20090.025). Cortical porosity tended to increase (6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095 to 9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093%, p\u2009=\u20090.07). Mineralizing surface, osteoid surface, and eroded surface surpassed control levels, as did cancellous bone volume, trabecular number, and cortical porosity. These data, the first to reflect such long exposure of any PTH for any disease, illustrate that PTH establishes and maintains a new skeletal state for at least 8 years in hypoparathyroidism. \u00a9 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["CORTICAL POROSITY", "HISTOMORPHOMETRY", "HYPOPARATHYROIDISM", "RHPTH(1-84)", "TRABECULAR TUNNELING"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Bone and Bones", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Recombinant Proteins", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Regional Bone Center, Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rukshana", "Last Name": "Majeed", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Omeragic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maximo", "Last Name": "Gomez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas L", "Last Name": "Nickolas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Dempster", "Affiliation": "Regional Bone Center, Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2018Nov"}, {"PMID": "29851137", "Title": "Vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D: results from the First International Conference on Controversies in Vitamin D.", "Abstract": "The First International Conference on Controversies in Vitamin D was held in Pisa, Italy, 14-16 June 2017. The meeting's purpose was to address controversies in vitamin D research, review the data available, to help resolve them, and suggest a research agenda to clarify areas of uncertainty. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration [i.e. the sum of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 ] remains the critical measurement for defining vitamin D status. Assay variation for 25(OH)D has contributed to the current chaos surrounding efforts to define hypovitaminosis D. An essential requirement to develop a consensus on vitamin D status is that measurement of 25(OH)D and, in the future, other potential vitamin D biomarkers [e.g. 1\u03b1,25(OH)2 D3 , 3-epi-25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2 D3, vitamin D-binding protein, free/bioavailable 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone] be standardized/harmonized, to allow pooling of research data. Vitamin D Standardization Program tools are described and recommended for standardizing 25(OH)D measurement in research. In the future, similar methodology, based on National Institute for Standards and Technology standard reference materials, must be developed for other candidate markers of vitamin D status. Failure to standardize/harmonize vitamin D metabolite measurements is destined to promulgate continued chaos. At this time, 25(OH)D values below 12\u00a0ng ml-1 (30\u00a0nmol l-1 ) should be considered to be associated with an increased risk of rickets/osteomalacia, whereas 25(OH)D concentrations between 20\u00a0ng ml-1 and 50\u00a0ng ml-1 (50-125\u00a0nmol l-1 ) appear to be safe and sufficient in the general population for skeletal health.

However, DXA has been subjected to recurring claims that it is overutilized, too expensive, and not helpful in patient management. In recent years, there has been a decline in the number of office-based DXA facilities, a reduction in BMD tests performed, and fewer women being diagnosed and treated for osteoporosis, despite aging of the population with more people at risk for fractures.

Under physiological conditions, PTH has actions that are more targeted to homeostasis and to bone accrual. The predominant action of PTH, either catabolic, anabolic or homeostatic, can be understood in molecular and pharmacokinetic terms. When administered intermittently, PTH increases bone mass, but when present continuously and in excess (e.g. PHPT), bone loss ensues. This dual effect of PTH depends not only on the dosing regimen, continuous or intermittent, but also on how the PTH molecule interacts with various states of its receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) influencing downstream signalling pathways differentially. Altering the amino-terminal end of PTH or PTHrP could emphasize the state of the receptor that is linked to an osteoanabolic outcome. This concept led to the development of a PTHrP analogue that interacts preferentially with the transiently linked state of the receptor, emphasizing an osteoanabolic effect. However, designing PTH or PTHrP analogues with prolonged state of binding to the receptor would be expected to be linked to a homeostatic action associated with the tonic secretory state of the parathyroid glands that is advantageous in treating hypoparathyroidism. Ideally, further development of a drug delivery system that mimics the physiological tonic, circadian, and pulsatile profile of PTH would be optimal. This review discusses basic, translational and clinical studies that may well lead to newer approaches to the treatment of osteoporosis as well as to different PTH molecules that could become more advantageous in treating hypoparathyroidism.", "Keywords": ["PTH", "PTHrP", "abaloparatide", "clinical pharmacology", "hypoparathyroidism", "osteoporosis", "parathyroid hormone", "primary hyperparathyroidism"], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Density", "Bone and Bones", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Osteoporosis", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Protein Binding", "Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1", "Translational Research, Biomedical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donovan", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "British journal of clinical pharmacology", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "28980621", "Title": "Hypoparathyroidism.", "Abstract": "This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038/nrdp.2017.55.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Mannstadt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rajesh V", "Last Name": "Thakker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fadil M", "Last Name": "Hannan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bart L", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Rejnmark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tamara J", "Last Name": "Vokes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen K", "Last Name": "Winer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dolores M", "Last Name": "Shoback", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated.

Nevertheless, in a given patient, classical skeletal involvement can be the first sign of primary hyperparathyroidism, but not recognized because it is not usually included, anymore, in the differential diagnosis of this manifestation of skeletal disease. We describe four cases of primary hyperparathyroidism in which the first clinical manifestation of the disease was a pathological fracture that masqueraded as a malignancy. The presence of large osteolytic lesions gave rise to the initial diagnosis of a primary or metastatic cancer. In none of the reported cases was primary hyperparathyroidism with osteitis fibrosa considered as the diagnosis. It would seem to us that this course is best explained by the fact that in many countries such manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism have become a rarity. In fact, the incidence of osteitis fibrosa among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in the US is estimated as so rare, that in majority of medical centers routine x-ray examinations of the bones in these patients is not recommended. The X-ray or computed tomography scan findings of osteitis fibrosa cystica include lytic or multilobular cystic changes. Multiple bony lesions representing brown tumors may be misdiagnosed on computed tomography scan as metastatic carcinoma, bone cysts, osteosarcoma, and especially giant-cell tumor.

Following pretreatment optimization of calcium and vitamin D doses, 124 patients in a phase III, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with hypoparathyroidism received subcutaneous injections of placebo or rhPTH(1-84) (50\u2009\u00b5g/day, titrated to 75 and then 100\u2009\u00b5g/day, to permit reductions in oral calcium and active vitamin D doses while maintaining serum calcium within 2.0-2.2\u2009mmol/L). Predefined endpoints related to phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism were analyzed. Serum phosphate levels decreased rapidly from the upper normal range and remained lower with rhPTH(1-84) (P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. placebo). At week 24, serum calcium-phosphate product was lower with rhPTH(1-84) vs. placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.001). rhPTH(1-84) treatment resulted in significant reductions in oral calcium dose compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.001) while maintaining serum calcium.

A single benign parathyroid adenoma is the cause in most people. However, multiglandular disease is not rare and is typically seen in familial PHPT syndromes. The genetics of PHPT is usually monoclonal when a single gland is involved and polyclonal when multiglandular disease is present. The genes that have been implicated in PHPT include proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. Hypercalcaemia is the biochemical hallmark of PHPT. Usually, the concentration of PTH is frankly increased but can remain within the normal range, which is abnormal in the setting of hypercalcaemia. Normocalcaemic PHPT, a variant in which the serum calcium level is persistently normal but PTH levels are increased in the absence of an obvious inciting stimulus, is now recognized. The clinical presentation of PHPT varies from asymptomatic disease (seen in countries where biochemical screening is routine) to classic symptomatic disease in which renal and/or skeletal complications are observed. Management guidelines have recently been revised to help the clinician to decide on the merits of a parathyroidectomy or a non-surgical course. This Primer covers these areas with particular attention to the epidemiology, clinical presentations, genetics, evaluation and guidelines for the management of PHPT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anxiety", "Asymptomatic Diseases", "Black People", "Fatigue", "Humans", "Hypercalcemia", "Hyperparathyroidism, Primary", "Irritable Mood", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Muscle Weakness", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Parathyroid Neoplasms", "Parathyroidectomy", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Somatoform Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aliya A", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism and Geriatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jian-Min", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Claudio", "Last Name": "Marcocci", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Francisco", "Last Name": "Bandeira", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Agamenon Magalh\u00e3es Hospital, Brazilian Ministry of Health, University of Pernambuco, Medical School, Recife, Brazil."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

With high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images, digital topological analysis (DTA) including skeletonization and topological classification was applied to transform the trabecular three-dimensional (3D) network into surface and curve skeletons. Using the DTA-based topological analysis and a new reconstruction/recovery scheme, individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) was developed to segment individual trabecular plates and rods and quantify the trabecular plate- and rod-related morphological parameters. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is an emerging in vivo imaging technique to visualize 3D bone microstructure. Based on HR-pQCT images, ITS was applied to various HR-pQCT datasets to examine trabecular plate- and rod-related microstructure and has demonstrated great potential in cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical applications. However, the reproducibility of ITS has not been fully determined. The aim of the current study is to quantify the precision errors of ITS plate-rod microstructural parameters. In addition, we utilized three different frequently used contour techniques to separate trabecular and cortical bone and to evaluate their effect on ITS measurements. Overall, good reproducibility was found for the standard HR-pQCT parameters with precision errors for volumetric BMD and bone size between 0.2%-2.0%, and trabecular bone microstructure between 4.9%-6.7% at the radius and tibia. High reproducibility was also achieved for ITS measurements using all three different contour techniques. For example, using automatic contour technology, low precision errors were found for plate and rod trabecular number (pTb.N, rTb.N, 0.9% and 3.6%), plate and rod trabecular thickness (pTb.Th, rTb.Th, 0.6% and 1.7%), plate trabecular surface (pTb.S, 3.4%), rod trabecular length (rTb.\u2113, 0.8%), and plate-plate junction density (P-P Junc.D, 2.3%) at the tibia. The precision errors at the radius were similar to those at the tibia. In addition, precision errors were affected by the contour technique. At the tibia, precision error by the manual contour method was significantly different from automatic and standard contour methods for pTb.N, rTb.N and rTb.Th. Precision error using the manual contour method was also significantly different from the standard contour method for rod trabecular number (rTb.N), rod trabecular thickness (rTb.Th), rod-rod and plate-rod junction densities (R-R Junc.D and P-R Junc.D) at the tibia. At the radius, the precision error was similar between the three different contour methods. Image quality was also found to significantly affect the ITS reproducibility. We concluded that ITS parameters are highly reproducible, giving assurance that future cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical HR-pQCT studies are feasible in the context of limited sample sizes.", "Keywords": ["HR-pQCT", "Individual trabecular segmentation (ITS)", "osteoporosis", "precision error", "trabecular microstructure"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Zhendong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Y Eric", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Xiaowei Sherry", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A.; McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Kyle K", "Last Name": "Nishiyama", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}], "Journal": "Pattern recognition letters", "PubDate": "2016Jun01"}, {"PMID": "27163785", "Title": "Tribute to Larry Raisz, MD, the Founding Editor of JBMR.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Periodicals as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Founding Head of the ASBMR Publications Committee, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2016Sep"}, {"PMID": "27144931", "Title": "Therapy of Hypoparathyroidism With PTH(1-84): A Prospective Six Year Investigation of Efficacy and Safety.", "Abstract": "Human recombinant (rh)PTH(1-84) was recently approved for the treatment of refractory hypoparathyroidism, based upon a short-term phase 3 clinical trial.

Using 2-D histomorphometric analysis, we previously found that 2 years of PTH(1-84) in HypoPT is associated with reduced trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and an increase in trabecular number (Tb.N). We have now utilized direct 3-D microstructural analysis to determine the extent to which these changes may be related to bone strength. Iliac crest bone biopsies from HypoPT subjects (n\u2009=\u200958) were analyzed by microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT) and by microfinite element (\u03bcFE) analysis. Biopsies were performed at baseline and at 1 or 2 years of recombinant human PTH(1-84) [rhPTH(1-84)]. In a subset of subjects (n = 13) at 3 months, we demonstrated a reduction in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, 0.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 to 0.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009mm; p\u2009=\u20090.005) and in the variance of trabecular separation (Tb.SD, 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 to 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009mm; p\u2009=\u20090.01), along with an increase in bone volume/total volume (BV/TV, 26.76\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1 to 32.83\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.02), bone surface/total volume (BS/TV, 3.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 to 4.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 mm(2) /mm(3) ; p\u2009=\u20090.005), Tb.N (1.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 versus 2.36\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 mm(-1) ; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and Young's modulus (649.38\u2009\u00b1\u2009460.7 to 1044.81\u2009\u00b1\u20091090.5\u2009N/mm(2) ; p\u2009=\u20090.049). After 1 year of rhPTH(1-84), Force increased (144.08\u2009\u00b1\u2009102.4 to 241.13\u2009\u00b1\u2009189.1\u2009N; p\u2009=\u20090.04) and Young's modulus tended to increase (662.15\u2009\u00b1\u2009478.2 to 1050.80\u2009\u00b1\u2009824.1\u2009N/m(2) ; p\u2009=\u20090.06). The 1-year change in cancellous mineralizing surface (MS/BS) predicted 1-year changes in \u03bcCT variables. The biopsies obtained after 2 years of rhPTH(1-84) showed no change from baseline. These data suggest that administration of rhPTH(1-84) in HypoPT is associated with transient changes in key parameters associated with bone strength. The results indicate that rhPTH(1-84) improves skeletal quality in HypoPT early in treatment. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE MICROARCHITECTURE", "FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS", "HYPOPARATHYROIDISM", "MICROCOMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY", "PTH(1-84)"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Bone Density", "Cancellous Bone", "Elastic Modulus", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parathyroid Hormone", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Zwahlen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Dempster", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Regional Bone Center, Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chengchen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ralph", "Last Name": "M\u00fcller", "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26664768", "Title": "Hypoglycemia Secondary to Sulfonylurea Ingestion in a Patient with End Stage Renal Disease: Results from a 72-Hour Fast.", "Abstract": "Insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels increase with sulfonylurea exposure but the acuity of increase has not been described in dialysis patients. We present a case of a dialysis patient who presented with hypoglycemia and was found to have accidental sulfonylurea ingestion. This is a 73-year-old man with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, without history of diabetes, who presented with hypoglycemia. Past medical history includes multiple myeloma, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. At initial presentation, his blood glucose was 47\u2009mg/dL, with concomitant elevations in the following: C-peptide 30.5 (nl: 0.8-3.5\u2009ng/mL), insulin 76 (nl: 3-19\u2009\u03bcIU/mL), and proinsulin 83.3 (nl: \u22648.0\u2009pmol/L). During the 72-hour fast, which he completed without hypoglycemia, insulin declined to be within normal limits (to 12\u2009\u03bcIU/mL); proinsulin (to 12.1\u2009pmol/L) and C-peptide (to 7.2\u2009ng/mL) levels decreased but remained elevated. The sulfonylurea screen ultimately returned positive for glipizide, clinching the diagnosis. This is the first reported case which characterizes the chronic elevation of proinsulin in a patient with ESRD, as well as its dramatic increase after a presumed solitary exposure to sulfonylurea.

We used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) and finite element analyses (FEA) to further investigate skeletal microstructure and estimated bone strength. We studied 60 hypoparathyroid subjects on conventional therapy using DXA, HRpQCT, and FEA of the distal radius and tibia compared with normative controls from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study. In hypoparathyroid women and men, areal BMD was above average at the lumbar spine and hip sites by DXA; radial BMD was also above average in hypoparathyroid women. Using HRpQCT, cortical volumetric BMD was increased in the hypoparathyroid cohort compared with controls at both the radius and tibia. Cortical porosity was reduced at both sites in pre- and postmenopausal women and at the tibia in young men with a downward trend at the radius in men. At the tibia, trabecular number was increased in premenopausal women and men and trabecular thickness was lower in women. Ultimate stress and failure load at both sites for the hypoparathyroid subjects were similar to controls. Using a linear regression model, at both radius and tibia, each increment in age decreased ultimate stress and failure load, whereas each increment in duration of hypoparathyroidism increased these same indices.

In this work, we studied the effect of 1-year or 2-year PTH(1-84) treatment on cancellous and cortical bone mineralization density distribution (Cn.BMDD and Ct.BMDD) based on quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) in paired transiliac bone biopsy samples. The study cohort comprised 30 adult hypoparathyroid patients (14 treated for 1 year; 16 treated for 2 years).

After 1-year PTH(1-84), Cn.CaMean was significantly lower than that at baseline (-6.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas in the 2-year PTH(1-84) group Cn.CaMean did not differ from baseline. Significant changes of Ct.BMDD were observed in the 1-year treatment group only.

PTH(1-84) treatment caused differential effects dependent on treatment duration that were consistent with the histomorphometric bone formation outcomes.

While PTH stimulates both bone formation and bone resorption, the duration and periodicity of exposure to PTH governs the net effect on bone mass, that is whether it is catabolic or anabolic. PTH receptor signaling in osteoblasts and osteocytes can increase the RANKL/OPG ratio, increasing both osteoclast recruitment and osteoclast activity, and thereby stimulating bone resorption. In contrast, PTH-induced bone formation is explained, at least in part, by its ability to downregulate SOST/sclerostin expression in osteocytes, permitting the anabolic Wnt signaling pathway to proceed. The two modes of administration of PTH, that is, continuous vs. intermittent, can regulate, in bone cells, different sets of genes; alternatively, the same sets of genes exposed to PTH in sustained vs. transient way, will favor bone resorption or bone formation, respectively.

As a result, a greater proportion of men who sustain a fragility fracture will have T-scores that are higher than they would if a male database were used; in fact, many men will fracture at T-scores that are \"normal.\" This highlights the importance of diagnosing osteoporosis not just by T-score, but also by the presence of fragility fracture and/or by estimations of fracture risk as generated by tools such as the FRAX calculator. The practical consequences of this change in densitometric definition of osteoporosis in men should be monitored, including the proportion of men at risk identified and treated as well as defining the response to treatment in those assessed by this more comprehensive approach.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Bone Density", "Female", "Fractures, Bone", "Humans", "Male", "Mathematical Computing", "Osteoporosis", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Terminology as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Binkley", "Affiliation": "University of Wisconsin Osteoporosis Clinical Research Program, 2870 University Avenue, Suite 100, Madison, WI, 53705, USA, nbinkley@wisc.edu."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Adler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current osteoporosis reports", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "25166047", "Title": "Bone disease in primary hyperparathyroidism.", "Abstract": "Bone disease in severe primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is described classically as osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC). Bone pain, skeletal deformities and pathological fractures are features of OFC. Bone mineral density is usually extremely low in OFC, but it is reversible after surgical cure. The signs and symptoms of severe bone disease include bone pain, pathologic fractures, proximal muscle weakness with hyperreflexia. Bone involvement is typically characterized as salt-and-pepper appearance in the skull, bone erosions and bone resorption of the phalanges, brown tumors and cysts. In the radiography, diffuse demineralization is observed, along with pathological fractures, particularly in the long bones of the extremities. In severe, symptomatic PHPT, marked elevation of the serum calcium and PTH concentrations are seen and renal involvement is manifested by nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. A new technology, recently approved for clinical use in the United States and Europe, is likely to become more widely available because it is an adaptation of the lumbar spine DXA image. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural analysis that provides an indirect index of trabecular microarchitecture.

The following conclusions are based upon publications reviewed in this article: 1) TBS gives lower values in postmenopausal women and in men with previous fragility fractures than their nonfractured counterparts; 2) TBS is complementary to data available by lumbar spine DXA measurements; 3) TBS results are lower in women who have sustained a fragility fracture but in whom DXA does not indicate osteoporosis or even osteopenia; 4) TBS predicts fracture risk as well as lumbar spine BMD measurements in postmenopausal women; 5) efficacious therapies for osteoporosis differ in the extent to which they influence the TBS; 6) TBS is associated with fracture risk in individuals with conditions related to reduced bone mass or bone quality.

The aim of the present study was to explain changes in bone turnover markers using once-weekly teriparatide with a simulation model. Temporary increases in bone formation markers and subsequent decreases were observed during once-weekly teriparatide treatment for 72 weeks. These observations support the hypothesis that repeated weekly teriparatide administration stimulates bone remodeling, replacing old bone with new bone and leading to a reduction in the active remodeling surface. A simulation model was developed based on the iterative remodeling cycle that occurs on residual old bone. An increase in bone formation and a subsequent decrease were observed in the preliminary simulation. For each fitted time point, the predicted value was compared to the absolute values of the bone formation and resorption markers and lumbar BMD. The simulation model strongly matched actual changes in bone turnover markers and BMD. This simulation model indicates increased bone formation marker levels in the early stage and a subsequent decrease.

However, 80% of fractures are non-vertebral and 70% of all bone loss is cortical and is produced by intracortical remodeling. The resulting cortical porosity increases bone fragility exponentially. Denosumab, a fully human anti-RANKL antibody, reduces the rate of bone remodeling more than alendronate. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of denosumab and alendronate on cortical and trabecular bone. Postmenopausal women, mean age 61years (range 50 to 70), were randomized double blind to placebo (n=82), alendronate 70mg weekly (n=82), or denosumab 60mg every 6months (n=83) for 12months. Porosity of the compact-appearing cortex (CC), outer and inner cortical transitional zones (OTZ, ITZ), and trabecular bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) of distal radius were quantified in vivo from high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans. Denosumab reduced remodeling more rapidly and completely than alendronate, reduced porosity of the three cortical regions at 6months, more so by 12months relative to baseline and controls, and 1.5- to 2-fold more so than alendronate. The respective changes at 12months were [mean (95% CI)]; CC: -1.26% (-1.61, -0.91) versus -0.48% (-0.96, 0.00), p=0.012; OTZ: -1.97% (-2.37, -1.56) versus -0.81% (-1.45, -0.17), p=0.003; and ITZ: -1.17% (-1.38, -0.97) versus -0.78% (-1.04, -0.52), p=0.021. Alendronate reduced porosity of the three cortical regions at 6months relative to baseline and controls but further decreased porosity of only the ITZ at 12months. By 12months, CC porosity was no different than baseline or controls, OTZ porosity was reduced only relative to baseline, not controls, while ITZ porosity was reduced relative to baseline and 6months, but not controls. Each treatment increased trabecular BV/TV volume similarly: 0.25% (0.19, 0.30) versus 0.19% (0.13, 0.30), p=0.208. The greater reduction in cortical porosity by denosumab may be due to greater inhibition of intracortical remodeling.

Using an advanced segmentation algorithm based on high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) images, we tested the hypothesis that Chinese American women have better cortical skeletal integrity owing to lower Ct.Po and higher Ct.TMD compared with white women. A total of 78 Chinese American women (49 premenopausal and 29 postmenopausal) and 114 white women (46 premenopausal and 68 postmenopausal) were studied. Premenopausal Chinese American versus white women had greater Ct.Th, Ct.BMD, and Ct.TMD at both the radius and tibia, and decreased Ct.Po (p\u2009<\u20090.05). A similar pattern was observed between postmenopausal Chinese American and white women. As expected, postmenopausal versus premenopausal women had lower Ct.BMD at the radius and tibia in both races (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Ct.Po largely increased between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, whereas Ct.TMD decreased by 3% to 8% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in both races.

However, in Asian countries, like China, PHPT did not show this evolution, but rather continued to be a symptomatic disease with target organ involvement. In this paper, we revisit the clinical features of PHPT in New York and Shanghai, representative United States and Chinese cites, over the past decade. The questions we address are whether the disease evolved in China to a more asymptomatic one and, whether in the United States further changes are evident. The results indicate that while PHPT continues to present primarily as an asymptomatic disease in the United States, a new phenotype characterized by normal serum calcium and high parathyroid hormone levels, normocalcemic PHPT, has emerged. Data from Shanghai demonstrates a trend for PHPT to present more commonly as an asymptomatic disorder in China. However, most patients with PHPT in China still manifest classical symptoms, i.e. nephrolithiasis and fractures. A comparison of the two cohorts shows that Chinese patients with PHPT are younger, with higher serum calcium and PTH levels, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than patients in New York. Normocalcemic PHPT has not yet been recognized in Shanghai. In summary, although the phenotypes of PHPT in both cities are evolving towards less evident disease, sharp clinical and biochemical differences are still apparent in PHPT as expressed in China and the United States.", "Keywords": ["asymptomatic", "normocalcemic primay hyperparathyroidism", "symptomatic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian-Min", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and surgeons, Columbia University , New York.

However, an alternative explanation for the apparent preservation of trabecular bone is fragmentation of the cortex by intracortical remodeling. The cortical fragments resemble trabeculae and so may be erroneously included in the quantification of 'trabecular' bone density. To test this hypothesis, we compared bone microarchitecture in 43 patients with untreated PHPT (mean 62.9 years, range 31-84) with 47 healthy age-matched controls and 25 patients with surgically treated PHPT (63.6 years, 30-82). Images of the distal radius and tibia were acquired using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT and analysed using StrAx1.0, a new software program that quantifies bone morphology in-vivo. Results were expressed as the mean number of standardized deviations (SD) from the age-specific mean (Z scores, mean\u00b1SEM). In subjects with PHPT, total tibial cortical area was reduced -0.26\u00b10.08 SD; p=0.002). Cortical volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was reduced (-0.29\u00b10.06 SD; p<0.001) due to higher cortical porosity (0.32\u00b10.06 SD; p<0.001) and lower tissue mineralization density (-0.21\u00b10.06 SD; p=0.002).

In subjects who underwent successful parathyroidectomy, cortical area (-0.18\u00b10.10 SD; NS) and medullary area (0.18\u00b10.10 SD; NS) did not differ from controls. Cortical vBMD was reduced (-0.15\u00b10.05 SD; p=0.003) due to high porosity (0.15\u00b10.05 SD; p=0.006), values numerically lower than in untreated PHPT.

For the osteoanabolic agent teriparatide, case reports and a randomized trial have produced mixed results, but they are consistent with a positive impact of teriparatide on fracture healing.

The summit was attended by 70 delegates from 15 countries. State-of-the-art lectures given by international authorities on osteoporosis covered a broad spectrum of topics ranging from osteoporosis in the male population, novel therapies in osteoporosis such as cathepsin K and sclerostin inhibitors, and the implementation and use of FRAX\u00ae in CEE, to an update on denosumab for the management of osteoporosis. Workshops organized to enable the exchange of individual experiences addressed the importance and current availability of osteology training for physicians and the impact of patient training programs on therapy compliance. Furthermore, the availability of and need for standardized quality controls and therapy guidelines in different CEE countries were discussed.

It is unclear whether these findings are relevant to postmenopausal women and if there are racial differences in the deterioration of bone microarchitecture with aging. We applied individual trabecula segmentation and finite element analysis to high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography images in premenopausal and postmenopausal Chinese-American and white women to quantify within-race age-related differences in Tb plate-versus-rod microarchitecture and bone stiffness. Race-menopause status interactions were assessed. Comparisons between races within menopause status were adjusted for age, height and weight. Comparisons between premenopausal and postmenopausal women were adjusted for height and weight. Adjusted analyses at the radius indicated that premenopausal Chinese-Americans had a higher plate bone volume fraction (pBV/TV), Tb plate-to-rod ratio (P-R ratio), and greater plate-plate junction densities (P-P Junc.D) versus white women (all p\u2009<\u20090.01), resulting in 27% higher Tb stiffness (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Despite these findings, fracture risk at both vertebral and nonvertebral sites is increased in PHPT. Emerging technologies, such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), may provide additional insight into microstructural features at sites such as the forearm and tibia that have heretofore not been easily accessible. Using HRpQCT, we determined cortical and trabecular microstructure at the radius and tibia in 51 postmenopausal women with PHPT and 120 controls. Individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) and micro-finite element (\u00b5FE) analyses of the HRpQCT images were also performed to further understand how the abnormalities seen by HRpQCT might translate into effects on bone strength. Women with PHPT showed, at both sites, decreased volumetric densities at trabecular and cortical compartments, thinner cortices, and more widely spaced and heterogeneously distributed trabeculae. At the radius, trabeculae were thinner and fewer in PHPT. The radius was affected to a greater extent in the trabecular compartment than the tibia. ITS analyses revealed, at both sites, that plate-like trabeculae were depleted, with a resultant reduction in the plate/rod ratio. Microarchitectural abnormalities were evident by decreased plate-rod and plate-plate junctions at the radius and tibia, and rod-rod junctions at the radius. These trabecular and cortical abnormalities resulted in decreased whole-bone stiffness and trabecular stiffness. These results provide evidence that in PHPT, microstructural abnormalities are pervasive and not limited to the cortical compartment, which may help to account for increased global fracture risk in PHPT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Bone Density", "Bone and Bones", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Hyperparathyroidism, Primary", "Postmenopause", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara C", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Boutroy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Udesky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Romano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elzbieta", "Last Name": "Dworakowski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aline G", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dinaz", "Last Name": "Irani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23162103", "Title": "Therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH(1-84): a prospective four-year investigation of efficacy and safety.", "Abstract": "PTH may be an effective treatment option for hypoparathyroidism, but long-term data are not available.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Calcium", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vitamin D"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Ives", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Tulley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Sliney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge C", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23099796", "Title": "Combination therapy with risedronate and teriparatide in male osteoporosis.", "Abstract": "Most studies of combination therapy with teriparatide and a bisphosphonate have not shown greater efficacy over monotherapy.
