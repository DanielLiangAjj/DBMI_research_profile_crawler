[{"PMID": "38917010", "Title": "Structural insights into the regulation of RyR1 by S100A1.", "Abstract": "S100A1, a small homodimeric EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein (~21 kDa), plays an important regulatory role in Ca2+ signaling pathways involved in various biological functions including Ca2+ cycling and contractile performance in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. One key target of the S100A1 interactome is the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a huge homotetrameric Ca2+ release channel (~2.3 MDa) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy structures of S100A1 bound to RyR1, the skeletal muscle isoform, in absence and presence of Ca2+. Ca2+-free apo-S100A1 binds beneath the bridging solenoid (BSol) and forms contacts with the junctional solenoid and the shell-core linker of RyR1. Upon Ca2+-binding, S100A1 undergoes a conformational change resulting in the exposure of the hydrophobic pocket known to serve as a major interaction site of S100A1. Through interactions of the hydrophobic pocket with RyR1, Ca2+-bound S100A1 intrudes deeper into the RyR1 structure beneath BSol than the apo-form and induces sideways motions of the C-terminal BSol region toward the adjacent RyR1 protomer resulting in tighter interprotomer contacts. Interestingly, the second hydrophobic pocket of the S100A1-dimer is largely exposed at the hydrophilic surface making it prone to interactions with the local environment, suggesting that S100A1 could be involved in forming larger heterocomplexes of RyRs with other protein partners. Since S100A1 interactions stabilizing BSol are implicated in the regulation of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, the characterization of the S100A1 binding site conserved between RyR isoforms may provide the structural basis for the development of therapeutic strategies regarding treatments of RyR-related disorders.", "Keywords": ["S100A1", "calcium", "cryo-EM", "ryanodine receptor"], "MeSH terms": ["Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel", "S100 Proteins", "Calcium", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Animals", "Protein Binding", "Binding Sites", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Weninger", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Marco C", "Last Name": "Miotto", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carl", "Last Name": "Tchagou", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Haikel", "Last Name": "Dridi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "S\u00f6ren", "Last Name": "Brandenburg", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Cellular Biophysics and Translational Cardiology Section, Heart Research Center G\u00f6ttingen, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, 37075 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel C", "Last Name": "Riedemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Cellular Biophysics and Translational Cardiology Section, Heart Research Center G\u00f6ttingen, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, 37075 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anetta", "Last Name": "Wronska", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Stephan E", "Last Name": "Lehnart", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Cellular Biophysics and Translational Cardiology Section, Heart Research Center G\u00f6ttingen, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, 37075 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2024Jul02"}, {"PMID": "38559077", "Title": "Location of ryanodine receptor type 2 mutation predicts age of onset of sudden death in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia - A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-based literature.", "Abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare inherited arrhythmia caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2).

While mitochondrial dysfunction related to oxidative stress is recognized as a crucial factor in VIDD, the exact molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we observe that 6\u2005h of MV triggers aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial size and interaction, associated with increased expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). This effect can be prevented by P110, a molecule that inhibits the recruitment of DRP1 to the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, isolated mitochondria from the diaphragms of ventilated patients exhibited increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These mitochondrial changes were associated with the rapid oxidation of type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and a decrease in the stabilizing subunit calstabin 1. Subsequently, we observed that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the ventilated diaphragms showed increased calcium leakage and reduced contractile function. Importantly, the mitochondrial fission inhibitor P110 effectively prevented all of these alterations. Taken together, the results of our study illustrate that MV leads, in the diaphragm, to both mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, linked to the up-/down-regulation of 320 proteins, as assessed through global comprehensive quantitative proteomics analysis, primarily associated with mitochondrial function. These outcomes underscore the significance of developing compounds aimed at modulating the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion as potential interventions to mitigate VIDD in human patients.", "Keywords": ["FIS1 inhibitor", "calcium homeostasis", "dynamin-related protein 1", "mitochondrial fission"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haikel", "Last Name": "Dridi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Yehya", "Affiliation": "PhyMedExp, INSERM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier 34000, France."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Barsotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19131, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Azria", "Affiliation": "PhyMedExp, INSERM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier 34000, France."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laith", "Last Name": "Bahlouli", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alain", "Last Name": "Lacampagne", "Affiliation": "PhyMedExp, INSERM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier 34000, France."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Matecki", "Affiliation": "PhyMedExp, INSERM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier 34000, France."}], "Journal": "PNAS nexus", "PubDate": "2023Nov"}, {"PMID": "37759809", "Title": "Mitochondrial Calcium Overload Plays a Causal Role in Oxidative Stress in the Failing Heart.", "Abstract": "Heart failure is a serious global health challenge, affecting more than 6.2 million people in the United States and is projected to reach over 8 million by 2030.

Chemotherapy was furthermore associated with abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and neurocognitive dysfunction in breast cancer mice. RyR2 leakiness and cognitive dysfunction could be ameliorated by treatment with a small molecule Rycal drug (S107). Chemobrain was also found in noncancer mice treated with DOX or methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil and could be prevented by treatment with S107. Genetic ablation of the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation site (RyR2-S2808A) also prevented the development of chemobrain. Chemotherapy increased brain concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling, suggesting that increased inflammatory signaling might contribute to oxidation-driven biochemical remodeling of RyR2. Proteomics and Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the signaling downstream of chemotherapy-induced leaky RyR2 was linked to the dysregulation of synaptic structure-associated proteins that are involved in neurotransmission.

Molecular mechanisms of ET remain poorly understood. Clinical data suggest the importance of the cerebellum in disease pathophysiology, and pathological studies indicate Purkinje Cells (PCs) incur damage. Our recent cerebellar cortex and PC-specific transcriptome studies identified alterations in calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways that included ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) in ET. RyR1 is an intracellular Ca2+ release channel located on the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), and in cerebellum is predominantly expressed in PCs. Under stress conditions, RyR1 undergoes several post-translational modifications (protein kinase A [PKA] phosphorylation, oxidation, nitrosylation), coupled with depletion of the channel-stabilizing binding partner calstabin1, which collectively characterize a \"leaky channel\" biochemical signature. In this study, we found markedly increased PKA phosphorylation at the RyR1-S2844 site, increased RyR1 oxidation and nitrosylation, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex in postmortem ET cerebellum. Decreased calstabin1-RyR1-binding affinity correlated with loss of PCs and climbing fiber-PC synapses in ET. This 'leaky' RyR1 signature was not seen in control or Parkinson's disease cerebellum. Microsomes from postmortem cerebellum demonstrated excessive ER Ca2+ leak in ET\u00a0vs.\u00a0controls, attenuated by channel stabilization. We further studied the role of RyR1 in tremor using a mouse model harboring a RyR1 point mutation that mimics constitutive site-specific PKA phosphorylation (RyR1-S2844D). RyR1-S2844D homozygous mice develop a 10\u00a0Hz action tremor and robust abnormal oscillatory activity in cerebellar physiological recordings. Intra-cerebellar microinfusion of RyR1 agonist or antagonist, respectively, increased or decreased tremor amplitude in RyR1-S2844D mice, supporting a direct role of cerebellar RyR1 leakiness for tremor generation. Treating RyR1-S2844D mice with a novel RyR1 channel-stabilizing compound, Rycal, effectively dampened cerebellar oscillatory activity, suppressed tremor, and normalized cerebellar RyR1-calstabin1 binding.

However, too much of a good thing can be bad. Intracellular Ca2+ overload can result in loss of function and death. Intracellular Ca2+ release channels evolved to safely provide large, rapid Ca2+ signals without exposure to toxic extracellular Ca2+. RyRs are intracellular Ca2+ release channels present throughout the zoosphere. Over the past 35 years, our knowledge of RyRs has advanced to the level of atomic-resolution structures revealing their role in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human disorders of heart, muscle, and brain. Stress-induced RyR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ leak in the heart can promote heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 leak contributes to muscle weakness in inherited myopathies, to age-related loss of muscle function and cancer-associated muscle weakness, and to impaired muscle function in muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne. In the brain, leaky RyR channels contribute to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Huntington's disease.

In humans, age-dependent loss of muscle function occurs at about 80 years of age and has been linked to dysfunction of ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Mammalian skeletal muscle RyR1 channels undergo age-related remodeling due to oxidative overload, leading to loss of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex. This destabilizes the closed state of the channel resulting in intracellular Ca2+ leak, reduced muscle function, and impaired exercise capacity. We now show that the C. elegans RyR homolog, UNC-68, exhibits a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation with mammalian RyR channels and similar age-dependent dysfunction. Like RyR1 in mammals, UNC-68 encodes a protein that comprises a macromolecular complex which includes the calstabin1 homolog FKB-2 and is immunoreactive with antibodies raised against the RyR1 complex. Furthermore, as in aged mammals, UNC-68 is oxidized and depleted of FKB-2 in an age-dependent manner, resulting in 'leaky' channels, depleted SR Ca2+ stores, reduced body wall muscle Ca2+ transients, and age-dependent muscle weakness. FKB-2 (ok3007)-deficient worms exhibit reduced exercise capacity. Pharmacologically induced oxidization of UNC-68 and depletion of FKB-2 from the channel independently caused reduced body wall muscle Ca2+ transients. Preventing FKB-2 depletion from the UNC-68 macromolecular complex using the Rycal drug S107 improved muscle Ca2+ transients and function. Taken together, these data suggest that UNC-68 oxidation plays a role in age-dependent loss of muscle function.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) control vasoconstriction via a Ca2+-dependent process, in which the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a major role. To dissect the mechanistic contribution of intracellular Ca2+ release to the increased vascular tone observed in HF, we analyzed the remodeling of IP3R1 in aortic tissues from patients with HF and from controls. VSMC IP3R1 channels from patients with HF and HF mice were hyperphosphorylated by both serine and tyrosine kinases. VSMCs isolated from IP3R1VSMC-/- mice exhibited blunted Ca2+ responses to angiotensin II (ATII) and norepinephrine compared with control VSMCs. IP3R1VSMC-/- mice displayed significantly reduced responses to ATII, both in vivo and ex vivo. HF IP3R1VSMC-/- mice developed significantly less afterload compared with HF IP3R1fl/fl mice and exhibited significantly attenuated progression toward decompensated HF and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the MLC by MLCK activated VSMC contraction. MLC phosphorylation was markedly increased in VSMCs from patients with HF and HF mice but reduced in VSMCs from HF IP3R1VSMC-/- mice and HF WT mice treated with ML-7.

This is accompanied by decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content, increased levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins, supercomplex formation and enhanced NADH-linked mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mechanistically, (S-)SIT increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in mouse myotubes and muscle fibres, and decreases pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation in human muscle and mouse myotubes.

Guided by high-resolution structures of skeletal muscle RyR1, obtained using cryogenic electron microscopy, we introduced mutations into putative Ca2+ and ATP binding sites and studied the function of the resulting mutant channels. These mutations confirmed the functional significance of the Ca2+ and ATP binding sites identified by structural studies based on the effects on channel regulation. Under normal conditions, Ca2+ activates RyR1 at low concentrations (\u00b5M) and inhibits it at high concentrations (mM). Mutations in the Ca2+-binding site impaired both activating and inhibitory regulation of the channel, suggesting a single site for both high and low affinity Ca2+-dependent regulation of RyR1 function. Mutation of residues that interact with the adenine ring of ATP abrogated ATP binding to the channel, whereas mutating residues that interact with the triphosphate tail only affected the degree of activation.

Here we provide evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to activation of TGF-\u00df signaling and oxidative overload. One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca 2+ ) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca 2+ which can promote heart failure 4,5 , pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects 7-9 . Ex-vivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug (ARM210) 10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients were activated in COVID-19 patients.

In the LmnaH222P/H222P murine model of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy caused by LMNA mutation, we demonstrate an age-dependent biochemical remodeling of RyR2 in the heart and RyR1 in skeletal muscle. This RyR remodeling is associated with heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Defective heart and muscle function are ameliorated by treatment with a novel Rycal small molecule drug (S107) that fixes 'leaky' RyRs.

In the present study we provide insight into the cause of cardiorespiratory dysfunction in HD and identify a potentially novel therapeutic target. We now show that intracellular calcium (Ca2+) leak via posttranslationally modified ryanodine receptor/intracellular calcium release (RyR) channels plays an important role in HD pathology. RyR channels were oxidized, PKA phosphorylated, and leaky in brain, heart, and diaphragm both in patients with HD and in a murine model of HD (Q175). HD mice (Q175) with endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak exhibited cognitive dysfunction, decreased parasympathetic tone associated with cardiac arrhythmias, and reduced diaphragmatic contractile function resulting in impaired respiratory function. Defects in cognitive, motor, and respiratory functions were ameliorated by treatment with a novel Rycal small-molecule drug (S107) that fixes leaky RyR.

The intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]) is regulated primarily by ion channels, pumps (ATPases), exchangers and Ca2+-binding proteins. Defective regulation of [Ca2+] is found in a diverse spectrum of pathological states that affect all the major organs. In the heart, abnormalities in the regulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] occur in heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), two common forms of heart disease and leading contributors to morbidity and mortality. In this Review, we focus on the mechanisms that regulate ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), the major sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release channel in the heart, how RYR2 becomes dysfunctional in HF and AF, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Inherited RYR2 mutations and/or stress-induced phosphorylation and oxidation of the protein destabilize the closed state of the channel, resulting in a pathological diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR that both triggers arrhythmias and impairs contractility. On the basis of our increased understanding of SR Ca2+ leak as a shared Ca2+-dependent pathological mechanism in HF and AF, a new class of drugs developed in our laboratory, known as rycals, which stabilize RYR2 channels and prevent Ca2+ leak from the SR, are undergoing investigation in clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Diastole", "Disease Progression", "Excitation Contraction Coupling", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Mice", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Mutation", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Stability", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel", "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum", "Tacrolimus Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haikel", "Last Name": "Dridi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Kushnir", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Zalk", "Affiliation": "The National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zephan", "Last Name": "Melville", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. arm42@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

Recently, we created a mouse model with spontaneous and sustained AF caused by a mutation in the NaV1.5 channel (F1759A) that enhances persistent Na+ current, thereby enabling the investigation of molecular mechanisms that cause AF and the identification of novel treatment strategies. The mice have regional heterogeneity of action potential duration of the atria similar to observations in patients with AF. In these mice, we found that the initiation and persistence of the rotational reentrant AF arrhythmias, known as spiral waves or rotors, were dependent upon action potential duration heterogeneity. The centers of the rotors were localized to regions of greatest heterogeneity of the action potential duration. Pharmacologically attenuating the action potential duration heterogeneity reduced both spontaneous and pacing-induced AF. Computer-based simulations also demonstrated that the action potential duration heterogeneity is sufficient to generate rotors that manifest as AF.

We are able to distinguish multiple closed states not evident with lower bandwidth recordings, suggesting the presence of an additional Ca2+ binding site, distinct from the site responsible for activation. An extended beta distribution analysis of our high-bandwidth data can be used to infer closed state flicker events as fast as 35 ns.

Osteolytic bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and are a major contributor to decreased survival, performance, and quality of life for patients. Pathologic fracture caused by osteolytic cancer in bone (OCIB) leads to a significant (32%) increased risk of death compared to patients without fracture. Since muscle weakness is linked to risk of falls which are a major cause of fracture, we have investigated skeletal muscle response to OCIB. Here, we show that a syngeneic mouse model of OCIB (4T1 mammary tumor cells) leads to cachexia and skeletal muscle weakness associated with oxidation of the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca2+) release channel (RyR1). Muscle atrophy follows known pathways via both myostatin signaling and expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1. We have identified a mechanism for skeletal muscle weakness due to increased oxidative stress on RyR1 via NAPDH oxidases [NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)]. In addition, SMAD3 phosphorylation is higher in muscle from tumor-bearing mice, a critical step in the intracellular signaling pathway that transmits TGF\u03b2 signaling to the nucleus. This is the first time that skeletal muscle weakness has been described in a syngeneic model of OCIB and represents a unique model system in which to study cachexia and changes in skeletal muscle.", "Keywords": ["breast cancer", "immune competent", "muscle weakness", "osteolytic disease", "syngeneic tumor model"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jenna N", "Last Name": "Regan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carter", "Last Name": "Mikesell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Haifang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Khalid S", "Last Name": "Mohammad", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Theresa A", "Last Name": "Guise", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Waning", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28653141", "Title": "Physiology and pathophysiology of excitation-contraction coupling: the functional role of ryanodine receptor.", "Abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+) release from intracellular stores plays a key role in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction.

RyR2 macromolecular complex remodeling, characterized by depletion of the regulatory protein calstabin2, resulted in increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial oxidative stress. We also report a functional interplay between amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, and altered Ca2+ signaling via leaky RyR2 channels. Thus, post-translational modifications of RyR occur downstream of A\u03b2 through a \u03b22-adrenergic signaling cascade that activates PKA. RyR2 remodeling in turn enhances \u03b2APP processing. Importantly, pharmacological stabilization of the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 channels, which prevents Ca2+ leakage, or blocking the \u03b22-adrenergic signaling cascade reduced \u03b2APP processing and the production of A\u03b2 in APPswe-expressing SH-SY5Y cells.

Abnormal regulation of RyR2 contributes to heart failure, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. RyR2 channels are oxidized, nitrosylated, and hyperphosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in heart failure, resulting in \"leaky\" channels. These leaky RyR2 channels contribute to depletion of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in defective cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In this review, we discuss both the importance of PKA and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulation of RyR2 in health, and how altered phosphorylation, nitrosylation and oxidation of RyR2 channels lead to cardiac disease. Correcting these defects using either genetic manipulation (knock-in) in mice, or specific and novel small molecules ameliorates the RyR2 dysfunction, reducing the progression to heart failure and the incidence of arrhythmias.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium Signaling", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Excitation Contraction Coupling", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Mice", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23442794", "Title": "MicroRNAs and the cellular response to rapamycin: potential role in diagnosis and therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["biomarkers", "mTOR", "microRNA", "rapamycin", "resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Mice", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplasms", "Sirolimus", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hana", "Last Name": "Totary-Jain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "PubDate": "2013Mar15"}, {"PMID": "23431178", "Title": "Cotransplantation with specific populations of spina bifida bone marrow stem/progenitor cells enhances urinary bladder regeneration.", "Abstract": "Spina bifida (SB) patients afflicted with myelomeningocele typically possess a neurogenic urinary bladder and exhibit varying degrees of bladder dysfunction. Although surgical intervention in the form of enterocystoplasty is the current standard of care in which to remedy the neurogenic bladder, it is still a stop-gap measure and is associated with many complications due to the use of bowel as a source of replacement tissue. Contemporary bladder tissue engineering strategies lack the ability to reform bladder smooth muscle, vasculature, and promote peripheral nerve tissue growth when using autologous populations of cells. Within the context of this study, we demonstrate the role of two specific populations of bone marrow (BM) stem/progenitor cells used in combination with a synthetic elastomeric scaffold that provides a unique and alternative means to current bladder regeneration approaches. In vitro differentiation, gene expression, and proliferation are similar among donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whereas poly(1,8-octanediol-cocitrate) scaffolds seeded with SB BM MSCs perform analogously to control counterparts with regard to bladder smooth muscle wall formation in vivo. SB CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells cotransplanted with donor-matched MSCs cause a dramatic increase in tissue vascularization as well as an induction of peripheral nerve growth in grafted areas compared with samples not seeded with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Finally, MSC/CD34(+) grafts provided the impetus for rapid urothelium regeneration. Data suggest that autologous BM stem/progenitor cells may be used as alternate, nonpathogenic cell sources for SB patient-specific bladder tissue regeneration in lieu of current enterocystoplasty procedures and have implications for other bladder regenerative therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Child", "Citrates", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Nerve Regeneration", "Polymers", "Rats", "Rats, Nude", "Regeneration", "Spinal Dysraphism", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Urinary Bladder", "Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arun K", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Urology, Ann and Robert H.

Inhibitors of mTOR, including rapamycin and its analogues, are being evaluated as antitumor agents. For their promise to be fulfilled, it is of paramount importance to identify the mechanisms of resistance and develop novel therapies to overcome it. Given the emerging role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that miRNAs could play important roles in the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. Long-term rapamycin treatment showed extensive reprogramming of miRNA expression, characterized by up-regulation of miR-17-92 and related clusters and down-regulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs. Inhibition of members of the miR-17-92 clusters or delivery of tumor suppressor miRNAs restored sensitivity to rapamycin. This study identifies miRNAs as new downstream components of the mTOR-signaling pathway, which may determine the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. It also identifies potential markers to assess the efficacy of treatment and provides novel therapeutic targets to treat rapamycin-resistant tumors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Mice", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplasm Proteins", "RNA, Neoplasm", "Signal Transduction", "Sirolimus", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Time Factors", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hana", "Last Name": "Totary-Jain", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, the Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. ht2167@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Despina", "Last Name": "Sanoudou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iddo Z", "Last Name": "Ben-Dov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cula N", "Last Name": "Dautriche", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Guarnieri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Tuschl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2013Mar01"}, {"PMID": "23281409", "Title": "Calcium cycling proteins and heart failure: mechanisms and therapeutics.", "Abstract": "Ca2+-dependent signaling is highly regulated in cardiomyocytes and determines the force of cardiac muscle contraction. Ca2+ cycling refers to the release and reuptake of intracellular Ca2+ that drives muscle contraction and relaxation. In failing hearts, Ca2+ cycling is profoundly altered, resulting in impaired contractility and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The key defects in Ca2+ cycling occur at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a Ca2+ storage organelle in muscle. Defects in the regulation of Ca2+ cycling proteins including the ryanodine receptor 2, cardiac (RyR2)/Ca2+ release channel macromolecular complexes and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a)/phospholamban complex contribute to heart failure. RyR2s are oxidized, nitrosylated, and PKA hyperphosphorylated, resulting in \"leaky\" channels in failing hearts. These leaky RyR2s contribute to depletion of Ca2+ from the SR, and the leaking Ca2+ depolarizes cardiomyocytes and triggers fatal arrhythmias. SERCA2a is downregulated and phospholamban is hypophosphorylated in failing hearts, resulting in impaired SR Ca2+ reuptake that conspires with leaky RyR2 to deplete SR Ca2+. Two new therapeutic strategies for heart failure (HF) are now being tested in clinical trials: (a) fixing the leak in RyR2 channels with a novel class of Ca2+-release channel stabilizers called Rycals and (b) increasing expression of SERCA2a to improve SR Ca2+ reuptake with viral-mediated gene therapy.
