Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence. These results provide important insights into transcriptional dysregulation in xenografted APPV717I neurons linked to synaptic function, and they indicate that LINGO2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Disease modeling", "Grafts", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "Transplantation", "iPSCs", "snRNA-seq"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "Animals", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Mutation", "Membrane Proteins", "Synapses", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Mares", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed A", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. vm2545@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38626772", "Title": "Osteopontin drives neuroinflammation and cell loss in MAPT-N279K frontotemporal dementia patient neurons.", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains.

This heterogeneity is further exacerbated during GBM recurrence, as treatment-induced reactive changes produce additional intratumoral heterogeneity that is ambiguous to differentiate on clinical imaging. There is an urgent need to develop non-invasive approaches to map the heterogeneous landscape of histopathological alterations throughout the entire lesion for each patient. We propose to predictively fuse Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with the underlying intratumoral heterogeneity in recurrent GBM using machine learning (ML) by leveraging image-localized biopsies with their associated locoregional MRI features. To this end, we develop BioNet, a biologically-informed neural network model, to predict regional distributions of three tissue-specific gene modules: proliferating tumor, reactive/inflammatory cells, and infiltrated brain tissue. BioNet offers valuable insights into the integration of multiple implicit and qualitative biological domain knowledge, which are challenging to describe in mathematical formulations. BioNet performs significantly better than a range of existing methods on cross-validation and blind test datasets. Voxel-level prediction maps of the gene modules by BioNet help reveal intratumoral heterogeneity, which can improve surgical targeting of confirmatory biopsies and evaluation of neuro-oncological treatment effectiveness. The non-invasive nature of the approach can potentially facilitate regular monitoring of the gene modules over time, and making timely therapeutic adjustment.

One hallmark of HD is the selective neuronal vulnerability of striatal medium spiny neurons. To date, the underlying mechanisms of this selective vulnerability have not been fully defined. Here, we employed a multi-omic approach including single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq), bulk RNAseq, lipidomics, HTT gene CAG repeat length measurements, and multiplexed immunofluorescence on post-mortem brain tissue from multiple brain regions of HD and control donors. We defined a signature of genes that is driven by CAG repeat length and found it enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. Moreover, weighted gene correlation network analysis showed loss of connectivity of astrocytic and microglial modules in HD and identified modules that correlated with CAG-repeat length which further implicated inflammatory pathways and metabolism. We performed lipidomic analysis of HD and control brains and identified several lipid species that correlate with HD grade, including ceramides and very long chain fatty acids. Integration of lipidomics and bulk transcriptomics identified a consensus gene signature that correlates with HD grade and HD lipidomic abnormalities and implicated the unfolded protein response pathway. Because astrocytes are critical for brain lipid metabolism and play important roles in regulating inflammation, we analyzed our snRNAseq dataset with an emphasis on astrocyte pathology. We found two main astrocyte types that spanned multiple brain regions; these types correspond to protoplasmic astrocytes, and fibrous-like - CD44-positive, astrocytes. HD pathology was differentially associated with these cell types in a region-specific manner. One protoplasmic astrocyte cluster showed high expression of metallothionein genes, the depletion of this cluster positively correlated with the depletion of vulnerable medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus. We confirmed that metallothioneins were increased in cingulate HD astrocytes but were unchanged or even decreased in caudate astrocytes. We combined existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a GWA study conducted on HD patients from the original Venezuelan cohort and identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the metallothionein gene locus associated with delayed age of onset. Functional studies found that metallothionein overexpressing astrocytes are better able to buffer glutamate and were neuroprotective of patient-derived directly reprogrammed HD MSNs as well as against rotenone-induced neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we found that metallothionein-overexpressing astrocytes increased the phagocytic activity of microglia in vitro and increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid binding.

Here, we identify lamin A/C (LMNA/C) as essential for transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We show that LMNA/C levels increase with differentiation of progenitors and that loss of Lmna in differentiated oligodendrocytes profoundly alters their chromatin accessibility and transcriptional signature. Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination. However, altered chromatin accessibility is detected in fully differentiated oligodendrocytes together with increased expression of progenitor genes and decreased levels of lipid-related transcription factors and inner mitochondrial membrane transcripts. These changes are accompanied by altered brain metabolism, lower levels of myelin-related lipids, and altered mitochondrial structure in oligodendrocytes, thereby resulting in myelin thinning and the development of a progressively worsening motor phenotype.

The burden of pathology is most pronounced in the brain stem including the medulla oblongata. Hypoxic/ischemic damage is the most frequent neuropathologic abnormality. Other neuropathologic features include neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases: astrogliosis and microglial reactivity. It is still unknown if these pathologies are secondary to hypoxia versus a combination of inflammatory response combined with hypoxia. It is also unknown how astrocytes react to neuroinflammation in COVID-19, especially considering evidence supporting the neurotoxicity of certain astrocytic phenotypes. This study aims to define the link between astrocytic and microglial pathology in COVID-19 victims in the inferior olivary nucleus, which is one of the most severely affected brain regions in COVID-19, and establish whether COVID-19 pathology is driven by hypoxic damage. Here, we conducted neuropathologic assessments and multiplex-immunofluorescence studies on the medulla oblongata of 18 COVID-19, 10 pre-pandemic patients who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 7-8 control patients with no ARDS or COVID-19. The comparison of ARDS and COVID-19 allows us to identify whether the pathology in COVID-19 can be explained by hypoxia alone, which is common to both conditions. Our results showed increased olivary astrogliosis in ARDS and COVID-19. However, microglial density and microglial reactivity were increased only in COVID-19, in a region-specific manner. Also, olivary hilar astrocytes increased YKL-40 (CHI3L1) in COVID-19, but to a lesser extent than ARDS astrocytes. COVID-19 astrocytes also showed lower levels of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and Metallothionein-3 in subsets of COVID-19 brain regions. Cluster analysis on immunohistochemical attributes of astrocytes and microglia identified ARDS and COVID-19 clusters with correlations to clinical history and disease course. Our results indicate that olivary glial pathology and neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 cannot be explained solely by hypoxia and suggest that failure of astrocytes to upregulate the anti-inflammatory YKL-40 may contribute to the neuroinflammation. Notwithstanding the limitations of retrospective studies in establishing causality, our experimental design cannot adequately control for factors external to our design. Perturbative studies are needed to confirm the role of the above-described astrocytic phenotypes in neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "astrocyte", "hypoxia", "inferior olivary nucleus", "microglia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nacoya", "Last Name": "Madden", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ying Zi Jessy", "Last Name": "Mei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juncheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37142563", "Title": "Re-convolving the compositional landscape of primary and recurrent glioblastoma reveals prognostic and targetable tissue states.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) diffusely infiltrates the brain and intermingles with non-neoplastic brain cells, including astrocytes, neurons and microglia/myeloid cells.

These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival.

Despite inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying TSC-associated neurological symptoms remain incompletely understood. Here we generate a Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model in which Tsc1 inactivation in late embryonic radial glia causes social and cognitive impairment and spontaneous seizures. Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "astrogliosis", "cortical hyperexcitability", "cytomegalic dysplastic neurons", "epileptogenesis", "tuberous sclerosis complex"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Pyramidal Cells", "Seizures", "Tuberous Sclerosis", "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wudu", "Last Name": "Lado", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jia Jie", "Last Name": "Teoh", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahrom", "Last Name": "Ham", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian J A", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Gal-3's role in the central nervous system has been less studied than in the immune system. However, recent studies show it exacerbates Alzheimer's disease and is upregulated in a large variety of brain injuries, while loss of Gal-3 function can diminish symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Several novel molecular pathways for Gal-3 were recently uncovered. It is a natural ligand for TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells), TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), and IR (insulin receptor). Gal-3 regulates a number of pathways including stimulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and modulating Wnt signalling in a context-dependent manner. Gal-3 typically acts in pathology but is now known to affect subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the healthy brain. Despite its myriad interactors, Gal-3 has surprisingly specific and important functions in regulating SVZ neurogenesis in disease. Gal-1, a similar lectin often co-expressed with Gal-3, also has profound effects on brain pathology and adult neurogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-3's carbohydrate recognition domain bears structural similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein necessary for cell entry. Gal-3 can be targeted pharmacologically and is a valid target for several diseases involving brain inflammation. The wealth of molecular pathways now known further suggest its modulation could be therapeutically useful.", "Keywords": ["Galectin-3", "galectin", "inflammation", "neurogenesis", "stem cells", "subventricular zone"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "COVID-19", "Cell Movement", "Galectin 3", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lateral Ventricles", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luana C", "Last Name": "Soares", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Sherrington Building, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Hillis", "Affiliation": "Massachusets General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 15 Parkman Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher C", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, 325 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isaiah", "Last Name": "Asbed", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Sherrington Building, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Masanori", "Last Name": "Sakaguchi", "Affiliation": "International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Francis G", "Last Name": "Szele", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Sherrington Building, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2021Nov05"}, {"PMID": "33856027", "Title": "COVID-19 neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital.", "Abstract": "Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop neurological signs and symptoms; although, to date, little evidence exists that primary infection of the brain is a significant contributing factor. We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

Viewpoint discusses insights from basic science and clinical perspectives on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the brain, with a particular focus on Parkinson's disease. Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified. Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important. In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report. We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's patients with COVID-19. While a role for the virus in causing or exacerbating Parkinson's disease appears unlikely at this time, aggravation of specific motor and non-motor symptoms has been reported, and it will be important to monitor subjects after recovery, particularly for those with persisting hyposmia.", "Keywords": ["Translational research"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology, Pharmacology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "Antonini", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Parkinson and Movement Disorders Unit, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Leta", "Affiliation": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF UK."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Nordvig", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Smeyne", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Zecca", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council of Italy, Segrate, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Sette", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Bubacco", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Olimpia", "Last Name": "Meucci", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Moro", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Ashley S", "Last Name": "Harms", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaqian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Fahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "K", "Last Name": "Ray Chaudhuri", "Affiliation": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF UK."}], "Journal": "NPJ Parkinson's disease", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32847628", "Title": "Neuronophagia and microglial nodules in a SARS-CoV-2 patient with cerebellar hemorrhage.", "Abstract": "We document the neuropathologic findings of a 73-year old man who died from acute cerebellar hemorrhage in the context of relatively mild SARS-CoV2 infection.

signaling pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. However, the molecular regulation of Wnt function in the pSVZ is poorly understood. We previously showed that Wnt signaling is upregulated in an SVZ gliomagenesis in\u2009vivo model. As well, the pro-inflammatory molecule Galectin-3 (Gal-3) increases Wnt signaling in cancer cells and is expressed in the SVZ. Therefore, we asked if Gal-3 has a similar function on Wnt signaling in the pSVZ. We interrogated Wnt signaling using a signaling reporter as well as immunohistochemistry and showed that Wnt signaling predominates upstream in the pSVZ lineage but is downregulated in migrating neuroblasts. Biochemical analysis of SVZ cells, in\u2009vivo and in neurosphere stem/progenitor cells, showed that Gal-3 physically interacts with multiple forms of \u03b2-catenin, which is a major downstream regulator of Wnt signaling. Functional analyses demonstrated, in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo, that Gal-3 knockdown increases Wnt signaling and conversely that Gal-3 OE inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the pSVZ. This latter result suggested that Gal-3, which is consistently increased in brain injury, may decrease pSVZ proliferation. We showed that Gal-3 OE decreased proliferation without altering cell cycle re-entry and that it increased p27Kip1, a molecule which induces cell cycle exit.

In this study, we focused on astrocytes, although we found significant gene expression differences in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia as well. In particular, the gene expression profiles of astrocytes in HD showed multiple signatures, varying in phenotype from cells that had markedly upregulated metallothionein and heat shock genes, but had not completely lost the expression of genes associated with normal protoplasmic astrocytes, to astrocytes that had substantially upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and had lost expression of many normal protoplasmic astrocyte genes as well as metallothionein genes. When compared to astrocytes in control samples, astrocyte signatures in HD also showed downregulated expression of a number of genes, including several associated with protoplasmic astrocyte function and lipid synthesis. Thus, HD astrocytes appeared in variable transcriptional phenotypes, and could be divided into several different \"states\", defined by patterns of gene expression.

The cues necessary for this process are unclear, despite this phase of brain development being pivotal in forebrain gliogenesis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is increased in multiple brain pathologies and thereby regulates astrocyte proliferation and inflammation in injury. To study the function of Gal-3 in inflammation and gliogenesis, we carried out functional studies in mouse. We overexpressed Gal-3 with electroporation and using immunohistochemistry surprisingly found no inflammation in the healthy postnatal SVZ. This allowed investigation of inflammation-independent effects of Gal-3 on gliogenesis. Loss of Gal-3 function via knockdown or conditional knockout reduced gliogenesis, whereas Gal-3 overexpression increased it. Gal-3 overexpression also increased the percentage of striatal astrocytes generated by the SVZ but decreased the percentage of oligodendrocytes. These novel findings were further elaborated with multiple analyses demonstrating that Gal-3 binds to the bone morphogenetic protein receptor one alpha (BMPR1\u03b1) and increases bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Conditional knockout of BMPR1\u03b1 abolished the effect of Gal-3 overexpression on gliogenesis. Gain-of-function of Gal-3 is relevant in pathological conditions involving the human forebrain, which is particularly vulnerable to hypoxia/ischemia during perinatal gliogenesis. Hypoxic/ischemic injury induces astrogliosis, inflammation and cell death. We show that Gal-3 immunoreactivity was increased in the perinatal human SVZ and striatum after hypoxia/ischemia.

The study population consisted of two groups: 52 dementia patients and 50 control subjects. All individuals were screened using the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test. Serum copper and lipid profile were also assessed. Results were statistically evaluated at p < 0.05 level of significance. The dementia group had 10.1% higher copper level than control subjects that was not statistically significant. No significant differences could be found between the two groups in lipid profile levels. There was no significant correlation between serum copper, lipid profile, and cognitive decline in elderly Jordanians. Demographic variables indicated that educational level less than 12 years and illiterate demonstrated a 3.29 fold (p = 0.026) and 6.29 fold (p = 0.002) increase in risk of developing dementia, respectively. Coffee intake demonstrated a protective effect against cognitive decline with 6.25 fold lower risk with increased coffee intake.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "cholesterol", "coffee", "copper", "dementia", "lipid profile"], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Blood Chemical Analysis", "Coffee", "Cognition", "Copper", "Dementia", "Diet", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Jordan", "Lipids", "Male", "Marital Status", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Olive Oil", "Plant Oils", "Sex Factors", "Sterols"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eman", "Last Name": "Al-khateeb", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biochemistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Ebaa", "Last Name": "Al-zayadneh", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biochemistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Medical students, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Zeinab", "Last Name": "Alawadi", "Affiliation": "Medical students, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Faisal", "Last Name": "khatib", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biochemistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Randa", "Last Name": "Naffa", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biochemistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}, {"First Name": "Yanal", "Last Name": "Shafagoj", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biochemistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24269916", "Title": "Blocked angiogenesis in Galectin-3 null mice does not alter cellular and behavioral recovery after middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke.", "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is thought to decrease stroke size and improve behavioral outcomes and therefore several clinical trials are seeking to augment it. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) expression increases after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and has been proposed to limit damage 3days after stroke. We carried out mild MCAO that damages the striatum but spares the cerebral cortex and SVZ. Gal-3 gene deletion prevented vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation after MCAO. This inhibited post-MCAO increases in endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis in the striatum allowing us to uniquely address the function of angiogenesis in this model of stroke. Apoptosis and infarct size were unchanged in Gal-3(-/-) mice 7 and 14 days after MCAO, suggesting that angiogenesis does not affect lesion size. Microglial and astrocyte activation/proliferation after MCAO was similar in wild type and Gal-3(-/-) mice. In addition, openfield activity, motor hemiparesis, proprioception, reflex, tremors and grooming behaviors were essentially identical between WT and Gal-3(-/-) mice at 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days after MCAO, suggesting that penumbral angiogenesis has limited impact on behavioral recovery. In addition to angiogenesis, increased adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis is thought to provide neuroprotection after stroke in animal models. SVZ neurogenesis and migration to lesion were overall unaffected by the loss of Gal-3, suggesting no compensation for the lack of angiogenesis in Gal-3(-/-) mice. Because angiogenesis and neurogenesis are usually coordinately regulated, identifying their individual effects on stroke has hitherto been difficult. These results show that Gal-3 is necessary for angiogenesis in stroke in a VEGF-dependant manner, but suggest that angiogenesis may be dispensable for post-stroke endogenous repair, therefore drawing into question the clinical utility of augmenting angiogenesis.", "Keywords": ["5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine", "ANOVA", "Angiogenesis", "BrdU", "CBF", "CSF", "Dcx", "ECM", "GFAP", "Gal-3", "Galectin-3", "H/I", "Ischemia", "MCA", "MCAO", "Middle cerebral artery occlusion", "Migration", "NeuN", "Neural repair", "Neurogenesis", "OB", "PCP", "PECAM-1", "PHi3", "RMS", "SVZ", "Subependymal zone", "TUNEL", "VEGF", "WT", "ace tub", "acetylated tubulin", "analysis of variance", "cerebral blood flow", "cerebrospinal fluid", "doublecortin", "extracellular matrix", "gamma-tubulin", "glial fibrillary acidic protein", "hypoxia ischemia", "middle cerebral artery", "middle cerebral artery occlusion", "neuronal nuclei", "olfactory bulb", "phosphorylated histone H3", "planar cell polarity", "platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1", "rostral migratory stream", "subventricular zone", "terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling", "vascular endothelial growth factor", "wild type", "\u03b2-cat", "\u03b2-catenin", "\u03b3-tub"], "MeSH terms": ["Angiogenesis Inducing Agents", "Animals", "Brain", "Brain Infarction", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Doublecortin Protein", "Galectin 3", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gliosis", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Neurogenesis", "Recovery of Function", "Time Factors", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher C", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "University of Oxford, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "University of Oxford, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nicola J", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "University of Oxford, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Keith J", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Micaela M", "Last Name": "Jenkins", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Fran\u00e7oise", "Last Name": "Poirier", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, UMR CNRS 7592, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, 75205 Paris 13, France."}, {"First Name": "Alastair M", "Last Name": "Buchan", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Francis G", "Last Name": "Szele", "Affiliation": "University of Oxford, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK.
