This field is largely inspired by the adaptability, fault tolerance, robustness, and energy efficiency inherent in biological senses, driving the development of numerous innovative digitalization techniques. Among these techniques, neuromorphic bioelectronics, characterized by biomimetic adaptability, stand out for their seamless bidirectional interactions with biological entities through stimulus-response and feedback loops, incorporating bio-neuromorphic intelligence for information exchange. This review illustrates recent progress in sensory digitalization, encompassing not only the digital representation of physical sensations such as touch, light, and temperature, correlating to tactile, visual, and thermal perceptions, but also the detection of biochemical stimuli such as gases, ions, and neurotransmitters, mirroring olfactory, gustatory, and neural processes. It thoroughly examines the material design, device manufacturing, and system integration, offering detailed insights. However, the field faces significant challenges, including the development of new device/system paradigms, forging genuine connections with biological systems, ensuring compatibility with the semiconductor industry, and overcoming the absence of standardization. Looking ahead, the ambition is to realize biocompatible neural prosthetics, exoskeletons, soft humanoid robots, and cybernetic devices that integrate smoothly with both biological tissues and artificial components, bridging the gap between organic and synthetic realms.

desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150-200\u00b0C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO2 emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol-containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF-HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25 \u00b0C and 1.0 bar the cis -COF exhibited a NH3 uptake capacity of 7.7 mmol g-1 and a NH3/N2 selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH3, about 29.0% could be removed by vis-light irradiated cis-trans isomerization at 25 \u00b0C, and the remaining NH3 might be released at 25 \u00b0C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption-desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH3 capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH3 and the smart COF, and the increase in polarity and in number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans-cis isomerization process.", "Keywords": ["Ammonia Capture * Covalent Organic Framework (COF) * Photo Switching * Azophenol"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxin", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Zhenzhen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Yunlei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiyong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Jikuan", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Huiyong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Suojiang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Process Engineering, CHINA."}, {"First Name": "Jianji", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Henan Normal University School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, East main street, 453002, Xinxiang, CHINA."}], "Journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "PubDate": "2024Jun13"}, {"PMID": "38843924", "Title": "Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression in Assessing Dengue Fever Spread Factors in YunnanBorder Regions.", "Abstract": "This study employs the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to assess the impact of meteorological elements and imported cases on dengue fever outbreaks, emphasizing the spatial-temporal variability of these factors in border regions.", "Keywords": ["Dengue fever", "Geographically and temporally weighted regression", "Meteorological factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Dengue", "China", "Humans", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Incidence", "Disease Outbreaks", "Spatial Regression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao Xiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102211, China."}, {"First Name": "Song Wang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102211, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan Fei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102211, China."}, {"First Name": "Ye Wu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102211, China."}, {"First Name": "Xue Mei", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102211, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Tao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Yunnan Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Pu'er 665000, Yunnan, China."}], "Journal": "Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES", "PubDate": "2024May20"}, {"PMID": "38781178", "Title": "Metabolomics and transcriptomics reveal the mechanism of alkaloid synthesis in Corydalis yanhusuo bulbs.", "Abstract": "Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang is a traditional herb. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are the main pharmacological active ingredients that play an important role in sedation, relieving pain, promoting blood circulation, and inhibiting cancer cells. However, there are few studies on the biosynthetic pathway of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in Corydalis yanhusuo, especially on some specific components, such as tetrahydropalmatine. We carried out widely targeted metabolome and transcriptomic analyses to construct the biosynthetic pathway of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and identified candidate genes. In this study, 702 metabolites were detected, including 216 alkaloids. Protoberberine-type and aporphine-type alkaloids are the main chemical components in C. yanhusuo bulbs. Key genes for benzylisoquinoline alkaloids biosynthesis, including 6-OMT, CNMT, NMCH, BBE, SOMT1, CFS, SPS, STOX, MSH, TNMT and P6H, were successfully identified. There was no significant difference in the content of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and the expression level of genes between the two suborgans (mother-bulb and son-bulb). The expression levels of BIA genes in the expansion stage (MB-A and SB-A) were significantly higher than those in the maturity stage (MB-C and SB-C), and the content of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids was consistent with the pattern of gene regulation. Five complete single genes were likely to encode the functional enzyme of CoOMT, which participated in tetrahydropalmatine biosynthesis in C. yanhusuo bulbs.

Here we found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MILIP supports TNBC cell survival, proliferation, and tumorigenicity by complexing with transfer RNAs (tRNA) to promote protein production, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in TNBC. MILIP was expressed at high levels in TNBC cells that commonly harbor loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor p53, and MILIP silencing suppressed TNBC cell viability and xenograft growth, indicating that MILIP functions distinctively in TNBC beyond its established role in repressing p53 in other types of cancers. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MILIP interacted with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1\u03b11) and formed an RNA-RNA duplex with the type II tRNAs tRNALeu and tRNASer through their variable loops, which facilitated the binding of eEF1\u03b11 to these tRNAs. Disrupting the interaction between MILIP and eEF1\u03b11 or tRNAs diminished protein synthesis and cell viability. Targeting MILIP inhibited TNBC growth and cooperated with the clinically available protein synthesis inhibitor omacetaxine mepesuccinate in vivo. Collectively, these results identify MILIP as an RNA translation elongation factor that promotes protein production in TNBC cells and reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MILIP, alone and in combination with other types of protein synthesis inhibitors, for TNBC treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms", "Humans", "Female", "RNA, Transfer", "Animals", "Mice", "Peptide Elongation Factor 1", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Cell Proliferation", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "Mice, Nude", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Si Min", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "General Surgery Department, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, P.R.

The homogeneity can be enhanced by adjusting the counter electrode size and solution flow rate. We have successfully produced relatively uniform nanorod arrays on an 8 \u00d7 10 cm2 i-ZnO-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a compact counter electrode and a vertical stirring setup. The as-grown nanorods exhibit similar surface morphologies and dominant, intense, almost uniform near-band-edge emissions in different regions of the sample. Additionally, the surface reflectance is significantly reduced after depositing the ZnO nanorods, achieving a moth-eye effect through subwavelength structuring. This effect of the nanorod array structure indicates that it can improve the utilization efficiency of light reception or emission in various optoelectronic devices and products. The large-scale preparation of ZnO nanorods is more practical to apply and has an extremely broad application value. Based on the research results, it is feasible to prepare large-scale ZnO nanorods suitable for antireflective coatings and commercial applications by optimizing the electrodeposition conditions.",

polymers with associative dynamic covalent bonds, can afford elastomers with recyclability while maintaining their thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we report a series of boronic ester-based vitrimers with tunable mechanical properties and recyclability by varying the substitute groups of boronic acid in polymer networks. The dynamic polymer networks are formed by reacting diol-containing tetra-arm poly(amidoamine) with boronic acid-terminated tetra-arm poly(ethylene glycol), which possesses different substituents adjacent to boronic acid moieties. Varying the substituent adjacent to the boronic ester unit will significantly affect the binding strength of the boronic ester, therefore affecting their dynamics and mechanical performance. The electron-withdrawing substituents noticeably suppress the dynamics of boronic ester exchange and increase the activation energy and relaxation time while enhancing the mechanical strength of the resulting elastic vitrimers. On the other hand, the presence of electron-rich substituent affords relatively reduced glass transition temperature (Tg), faster relaxation, and prominent recyclability and malleability at lower temperatures. The developed pathway will guide the rational design of elastomers with well-tunable dynamics and processabilities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zoriana", "Last Name": "Demchuk", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexei P", "Last Name": "Sokolov", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peng-Fei", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Journal": "ACS materials Au", "PubDate": "2024Mar13"}, {"PMID": "38447732", "Title": "Spatial distribution characteristics and degradation mechanism of microorganisms in n-hexadecane contaminated vadose zone.", "Abstract": "The damage caused by petroleum hydrocarbon pollution to soil and groundwater environment is becoming increasingly significant. The vadose zone is the only way for petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants to leak from surface into groundwater. The spatial distribution characteristics of indigenous microorganisms in vadose zone, considering presence of capillary zones, have rarely been reported. To explore the spatial distribution characteristics of indigenous microorganisms in vadose zone contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons, a one-dimensional column migration experiment was conducted using n-hexadecane as characteristic pollutant. Soil samples were collected periodically from different heights during experiment. Corresponding environmental factors were monitored online. The microbial community structure and spatial distribution characteristics of the cumulative relative abundance were systematically analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition, the microbial degradation mechanism of n-hexadecane was analyzed using metabolomics. The results showed that presence of capillary zone had a strong retarding effect on n-hexadecane infiltration. Leaked pollutants were mainly concentrated in areas with strong capillary action. Infiltration and displacement of NAPL-phase pollutants were major driving force for change in moisture content (\u03b8) and electric conductivity (EC) in vadose zone. The degradation by microorganisms results in a downward trend in potential of hydrogen (pH) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Five petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial phyla and 11 degradable straight-chain alkane bacterial genera were detected. Microbial degradation was strong in the area near edge of capillary zone and locations of pollutant accumulation. Mainly Sphingomonas and Nocardioides bacteria were involved in microbial degradation of n-hexadecane. Single-end oxidation involved microbial degradation of n-hexadecane (C16H34). The oxygen consumed, hexadecanoic acid (C16H32O2) produced during this process, and release of hydrogen ions (H+) were the driving factors for reduction of ORP and pH. The vadose zone in this study considered presence of capillary zone, which was more in line with actual contaminated site conditions compared with previous studies. This study systematically elucidated vertical distribution characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants and spatiotemporal variation characteristics of indigenous microorganisms in vadose zone considered presence of capillary zone. In addition, the n-hexadecane degradation mechanism was elucidated using metabolomics.

To address this issue and provide novel insights for fracture treatment, we compiled this review. This review aims to study the impact of nerve injury on fracture healing, exploring the role of neurotrophic factors in the healing process. We first revisited the effects of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) on the skeletal system, and further explained the phenomenon of significantly accelerated fracture healing under nerve injury conditions.

The study investigated the presence and characteristics of TAMs in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and assessed their influence on patient prognosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to identify CD204+ TAMs in a cohort of 72 patients with ccRCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CD204+ TAMs in each group. The TCGA-KIRC cohort was used to analyze the relationship between CD204 and immunity. The functions of CD204+ TAMs in the TCGA-KIRC cohort were analyzed through GO enrichment analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF) was conducted to confirm the positive effects of CD204 on regulatory T (Treg) cells and exhausted T (Tex) cells. Results: There was a negative relation between high infiltration of CD204+ TAMs and both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in ccRCC. A positive correlation was found between high-infiltrating CD204+ TAMs and distant organ metastasis, as well as lymph node metastasis. In the TCGA-KIRC cohort, the group with high expression of CD204 exhibited significant up-regulation of 120 genes as well as enrichment in the negative regulation of immunity. CD204 high-expression group showed up-regulation of Treg cells and Tex cells. Conclusion: The presence of CD204+ TAMs in ccRCC is associated with a negative prognosis in patients.

However, there was rare information on spatiotemporal evolution and pollution levels of heavy metals in the major grain-producing areas. We extracted and examined data from 276 publications between 2010 and 2021 covering five major grain-producing regions in China from 2010 to 2021. Spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of main heavy metals/metalloids was obtained by meta-analysis. In addition, subgroup analyses were carried out to study preliminary correlations related to accumulation of the pollutants. Cadmium (Cd) was found to be the most prevailing pollutant in the regions in terms of both spatial distribution and temporal accumulation. The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain was the most severely polluted. Accumulation of Cd, mercury (Hg) and copper (Cu) increased from 2010 to 2015 when compared with the 1990 background data. Further, the levels of five key heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, lead [Pb] and zinc [Zn]) showed increasing trends from 2016 to 2021 in all five regions. Soil pH and mean annual precipitation had variable influences on heavy metal accumulation. Alkaline soil and areas with less rainfall faced higher pollution levels.

In C. elegans, RNAi knockdown of pezo-1 had no impact on lifespan, body length, lethality, locomotion behaviors, or oxidative response (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, exposure to 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L nanopolystyrene in the pezo-1 RNAi group resulted in severe locomotion changes: head trashes (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), body bends (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), forward turns (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), backward turns (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and impaired sensory perception, including abnormal chemotaxis to NaCl (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and diacetyl (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), as well as aversive responses (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) to nanopolystyrene compared to the wild-type group.

Despite great success in improving the adhesive properties of elastomers, permanent adhesives tend to stick to the surfaces prematurely or result in poor contact depending on the installation method. Thus, elastomers with on-demand adhesion that is not limited to being triggered by UV light or heat, which may not be practical for scenarios that do not allow an additional external source, provide a solution to various challenges in conventional adhesive elastomers. Herein, we report a novel, ready-to-use, ultra high-strength, ductile adhesive elastomer with an on-demand adhesion feature that can be easily triggered by a compression force. The precursor is mainly composed of a capsule-separated, two-component curing system. After a force-trigger and curing process, the ductile adhesive elastomer exhibits a peel strength and a lap shear strength of 1.2 \u00d7 104 N m-1 and 7.8 \u00d7 103 kPa, respectively, which exceed the reported values for advanced ductile adhesive elastomers. The ultra-high adhesion force is attributed to the excellent surface contact of the liquid-like precursor and to the high elastic modulus of the cured elastomer that is reinforced by a two-phase design. Incorporation of such on-demand adhesion into an elastomer enables a controlled delay between installation and curing so that these can take place under their individual ideal conditions, effectively reducing the energy cost, preventing failures, and improving installation processes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Zoriana", "Last Name": "Demchuk", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China. caopf@buct.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jiancheng", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Bingrui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "The Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Education, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Alexei P", "Last Name": "Sokolov", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Diana", "Last Name": "Hun", "Affiliation": "Buildings and Transportation Science Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. hunde@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Tomonori", "Last Name": "Saito", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. saitot@ornl.gov."}, {"First Name": "Peng-Fei", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China. caopf@buct.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Materials horizons", "PubDate": "2024Feb19"}, {"PMID": "38052943", "Title": "Bacteria-derived nanovesicles enhance tumour vaccination by trained immunity.", "Abstract": "Trained immunity enhances the responsiveness of immune cells to subsequent infections or vaccinations.

Herein, we addressed this conundrum by constructing a unique atomic dispersed hetero-pair consisting of Mo-Fe di-atoms anchored on N-doped carbon carrier. This system shows an unprecedented CO2RR intrinsic activity with TOF of 3336\u00a0h-1, high selectivity toward CO production, Faradaic efficiency of 95.96% at -\u20090.60\u00a0V and excellent stability. Theoretical calculations show that the Mo-Fe diatomic sites increased the *COOH intermediate adsorption energy by bridging adsorption of *COOH intermediates. At the same time, d-d orbital coupling in the Mo-Fe di-atom results in electron delocalization and facilitates desorption of *CO intermediates. Thus, the undesirable correlation between these steps is broken.

To answer this question we studied thin films of CoOx supported on an Au(111) single crystal surface as a model for the CO oxidation reaction. We show that three reaction regimes exist in response to chemical and topographic restructuring of the CoOx catalyst as a function of reactant gas phase CO/O2 stoichiometry and temperature. Under oxygen-lean conditions and moderate temperatures (\u2264150\u2009\u00b0C), partially oxidized films (CoOx<1) containing Co0 were found to be efficient catalysts. In contrast, stoichiometric CoO films containing only Co2+ form carbonates in the presence of CO that poison the reaction below 300\u2009\u00b0C. Under oxygen-rich conditions a more oxidized catalyst phase (CoOx>1) forms containing Co3+ species that are effective in a wide temperature range. Resonant photoemission spectroscopy (ResPES) revealed the unique role of Co3+ sites in catalyzing the CO oxidation. Density function theory (DFT) calculations provided deeper insights into the pathway and free energy barriers for the reactions on these oxide phases.

In this work, we present a new mechanism for intercalating large molecules through monolayer graphene to form confined oxide materials at the graphene-substrate heterointerface. We investigate the intercalation of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) molecules directly from the vapor phase and confirm the formation of confined P2O5 at the graphene-substrate heterointerface using various techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) corroborates the experimental results and reveals the intercalation mechanism, whereby P2O5 dissociates into small fragments catalyzed by defects in the graphene that then permeates through lattice defects and reacts at the heterointerface to form P2O5. This process can also be used to form new confined metal phosphates (e.g., 2D InPO4). While the focus of this study is on P2O5 intercalation, the possibility of intercalation from predissociated molecules catalyzed by defects in graphene may exist for other types of molecules as well.

Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV-inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long-term training, and trained tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV-based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV-SIRP\u03b1@CaP/GM-CSF) for exerting vaccine-enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM-CSF-assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP\u03b1-Fc-assisted OMVs trigger TAM-mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV-mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM-hot and T cell-cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16-F10 tumor model (T cell-hot and TAM-cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity.

Although there are certain first-line therapies to treat MS, their unsatisfactory efficacy is partly due to the limited CNS access after systemic administration. Besides, there is an urgent need to treat MS by enhancing remyelination or neuroprotection, or dampen the activity of microglia. Astragaloside IV (ASI) bears anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, remyelination and neuroprotective activity. While its poor permeability, relatively high molecular weight and low lipophilicity restrict it to reach the brain. Therefore, \u03b2-asarone modified ASI loaded chitosan nanoparticles (ASI-\u03b2CS-NP) were prepared to enhance the nose-to-brain delivery and therapeutic effects of ASI on EAE mice. The prepared ASI-\u03b2CS-NP showed mean size of about 120\u00a0nm, and zeta potential from +19 to +25\u00a0mV. DiR-\u03b2CS-NP was confirmed with good nose-to-brain targeting ability. After intranasal administration, the ASI-\u03b2CS-NP significantly reduced behavioral scores, decreased weight loss, suppressed inflammatory infiltration and astrocyte/microglial activation, reduced demyelination and increased remyelination on a mice EAE model.

Ascorbic acid can create a Pt-skin of three atomic layers to make the typical PtCu-alloy@Pt-skin core/shell nanostructure rather than the uniform alloys generated by using alkaline reductants.

However, the surface inertia of Ti implants leads to delayed integration of Ti and new bone, as well as problems such as aseptic loosening and inadequate osseointegration. Magnesium (Mg) ions can promote bone regeneration, and many studies have used Mg-containing materials to modify the Ti implant surface. This systematic review summarizes the methods, effects, and clinical applications of surface modification of Ti implants with Mg-containing coatings. Database collection was completed on Janury 1, 2023, and a total of 29 relevant studies were ultimately included. Mg can be compounded with different materials and coated to the surface of Ti implants using different methods. In vitro\u00a0and\u00a0in vivo\u00a0experiments have shown that Mg-containing coatings promote cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. On the one hand, the surface roughness of implants increases with the addition of Mg-containing coatings, which is thought to have an impact on the osseointegration of the implant. On the other hand, Mg ions promote cell attachment through binding interactions between the integrin family and FAK-related signaling pathways. And Mg ions could induce osseointegration by activating PI3K, Notch, ERK/c-Fos, BMP-4-related signaling pathways and TRPM7 protein channels. Overall, Mg-based coatings show great potential for the surface modification of Ti implants to promote osseointegration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The inertia surface of titanium (Ti) implants leads to delayed osseointegration. Magnesium (Mg) ions, known for promoting bone regeneration, have been extensively studied to modify the surface of Ti implants. However, no consensus has been reached on the appropriate processing methods, surface roughness and effective concentration of Mg-containing coatings for osseointegration.

In this work, the distortion caused by the WAAM reinforcement of half-cylinder shell geometries was investigated through experiments and transient thermo-mechanical finite element simulations. In the experiments, the weld beads were applied to the specimen, while its thermal history was measured using thermocouples. The developing distortions were registered using displacement transducers. The experimental data were used to calibrate and validate the simulation. Using the validated model, the temperature field and the distortions of the specimens could be predicted. Subsequently, the simulation was used to assess different deposition patterns and shell thicknesses with regard to the resulting part distortions. The investigations revealed a non-linear relation between shell thickness and distortion. Moreover, the orientation and the sequence of the weld beads had a significant impact on the formation of distortion.

"Tough hydrogel has attracted considerable interest in various fields, however, due to poor biocompatibility, nondegradation, and pronounced compositional differences from natural tissues, it is

Inspired by human exercise to improve muscle strength, the synergistic effect is utilized to generate highly functional crystalline domains for resisting crack propagation. The GBTH exhibits excellent tensile strength of 6.67\u00a0MPa (145-fold that after untreated gelation). Furthermore, it is directly sutured to a ruptured tendon of adult rabbits due to its pronounced toughness and biocompatibility, self-degradability in vivo, and similarity to natural tissue components. Ruptured tendons can compensate for mechanotransduction by GBTH and stimulate tendon differentiation to quickly return to the initial state, that is, within eight weeks.

Here, firstly, we obtain a novel carbon-supported oxygen-coordinated single-Fe-atom catalyst for highly efficient production of ammonia from electrocatalytic N2RR. Based on such new type of N2RR electrocatalyst, by combining operando X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) with density function theory calculation, we reveal significantly that the as-prepared active coordination structure undergoes a potential-driven two-step restructuring, firstly from FeSAO4(OH)1a to FeSAO4(OH)1a'(OH)1b with the adsorption of another -OH on FeSA at open-circuit potential (OCP) of 0.58 VRHE, and subsequently restructuring from FeSAO4(OH)1a'(OH)1b to FeSAO3(OH)1a\u2033 due to the breaking of one Fe-O bond and the dissociation of one -OH at working potentials for final electrocatalytic process of N2RR, thus revealing the first potential-induced in\u00a0situ formation of the real electrocatalytic active sites to boost the conversion of N2 to NH3. Moreover, the key intermediate of Fe-NNHx was detected experimentally by both operando XAS and in\u00a0situ attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectra (ATR-SEIRAS), indicating the alternating mechanism followed by N2RR on such catalyst.

The presence of a dynamic exchangeable disulfide affords self-heability and recyclability, and the chemical attachment between SiO2 nanoparticles and the polymer matrix enables the homogeneous distribution of inorganic fillers and mechanical robustness. With integrated flexibility, fast segmental dynamics, and autonomous adaptability, the as-prepared CHDN-based protective layer enables superior electrochemical performance in half cells and full cells (capacity retention of 83.7% over 400 cycles for the CHDN@Li/LiFePO4 cell at 1 C).

However, most of current methods for identifying important areas have different assessment criteria and focus on different biological assemblages (species or communities) and ecosystem types. Key biodiversity areas (KBAs) are sites that contribute significantly to global biodiversity persistence. Unlike traditional research and identification methods, KBAs identification is based on a unified global standard to explore habitats that are critical to endangered plants and animals in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Based on the theoretical and technical framework of KBAs, we summarized the system of identification criteria and assessment parameters for KBAs. The five high-level criteria are separated into eleven sub-level criteria. Among the eleven evaluation parameters, there is one evaluation parameter for the ecosystem level, eight evaluation parameters for the species level, one evaluation parameter for the gene level, and one comprehensive evaluation parameter. In addition, we analyzed the application of KBAs identification in biodiversity research and conservation combined with relevant domestic and foreign research cases.

Recently, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been regarded as a protective bioactive polyphenol in green tea that has the ability to protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the molecular mechanism remains poorly deciphered. Ferroptosis plays a vital role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but experimental evidence of ferroptosis inhibition by epigallocatechin gallate is limited. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of epigallocatechin gallate on hepatic ferroptosis to mitigate hepatic injury in high-fat diet-fed mice. Methods: Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a standard chow diet (SCD), a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet and administered epigallocatechin gallate or ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis-specific inhibitor) for 12\u00a0weeks. Liver injury, lipid accumulation, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, iron overload, and ferroptosis marker proteins were examined. In vitro, steatotic L-02 cells were used to explore the underlying mechanism. Results: In our research, we found that epigallocatechin gallate notably alleviated liver injury and lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, hepatic steatosis, decreased iron overload and inhibited ferroptosis in a high-fat diet-induced murine model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro experiments, using ferrostatin-1 and a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MtROS) scavenger (Mito-TEMPO), we found that epigallocatechin gallate remarkably alleviated oxidative stress and inhibited ferroptosis by reducing the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in steatotic L-02 cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our results revealed that epigallocatechin gallate may exert protective effects on hepatic lipotoxicity by inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated hepatic ferroptosis.

The generation of iPSCs from somatic cells via transcriptional-factor- or chemical molecule-based approaches are time-consuming and inefficient. Here, a cell-reprogramming-inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel is fabricated via a synthetic-biology-based strategy. Human and mouse somatic cells (including senescent cells) are efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. The cell-reprogramming-responsive hydrogel possesses dynamic bioresponsiveness, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. Mechanistic study demonstrates that the autonomous change of the mechanical properties of the cell-reprogramming-responsive hydrogel elicits the formation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates with the appropriate timing during cell reprogramming, ensuring a faster and more efficient generation of iPSCs than conventional cell reprogramming approach.

Enabling technology for exogenous antigen display should not only ensure the assembly ability of VLPs and site-specific modification, but also consider the effect of preexisting immunity on the behavior of VLPs in vivo. Here, combining genetic code expansion technique and synthetic biology strategy, a site-specific modification method for hepatitis B core (HBc) VLPs via incorporating azido-phenylalanine into the desired positions is described.

The site-specific modification of HBc VLPs not only improves the immunogenicity of MUC1 antigens but also shields the immunogenicity of HBc VLPs themselves, thereby activating a strong and persistent anti-MUC1 immune response even in the presence of preexisting anti-HBc immunity, which results in the efficient tumor elimination in a lung metastatic mouse model.

We also identified the mechanisms through which GelMA/Mg/Zn hydrogel promoted wound healing: the Mg2+ promoted Zn2+ entry into HSFs and increased the concentration of Zn2+ in HSFs, which effectively induced HSFs to differentiate into myofibroblasts by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway.

This disease is heterogeneous, with clinical subtypes being estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) positive, having human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression, or being triple-negative for ER-\u03b1, progesterone receptor, and HER2 (TNBC). The ER-\u03b1 positive and HER2 overexpressing tumors can be treated with agents targeting these proteins, including tamoxifen and pertuzumab, respectively. Despite these treatments, resistance and metastasis are problematic, while TNBC is challenging to treat due to the lack of suitable targets. Many studies examining BC and other tumors indicate a role for N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1) as a metastasis suppressor. The ability of NDRG1 to inhibit metastasis is due, in part, to the inhibition of the initial step in metastasis, namely the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Paradoxically, there are also reports of NDRG1 playing a pro-oncogenic role in BC pathogenesis. The oncogenic effects of NDRG1 in BC have been reported to relate to lipid metabolism or the mTOR signaling pathway. The molecular mechanism(s) of how NDRG1 regulates the activity of multiple signaling pathways remains unclear. Therapeutic strategies that up-regulate NDRG1 have been developed and include agents of the di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone class. These compounds target oncogenic drivers in BC cells, suppressing the expression of multiple key hormone receptors including ER-\u03b1, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, and prolactin receptor, and can also overcome tamoxifen resistance. Considering the varying role of NDRG1 in BC pathogenesis, further studies are required to examine what subset of BC patients would benefit from pharmacopeia that up-regulate NDRG1.", "Keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Metastasis suppressor", "NDRG1", "RTKs", "Therapeutic target"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Receptors, Progesterone", "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Tamoxifen"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Cell Biology and Drug Discovery, Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, Queensland 4111, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Des R", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Cell Biology and Drug Discovery, Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, Queensland 4111, Australia; Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.

Central to the psychological-neurological nexus are interactions between neurotransmitters and their receptors expressed on breast cancer cells and other types of cells in the tumor microenvironment, which activate various intracellular signaling pathways. Importantly, the manipulation of these interactions is emerging as a potential avenue for breast cancer prevention and treatment. However, an important caveat is that the same neurotransmitter can exert multiple and sometimes opposing effects. In addition, certain neurotransmitters can be produced and secreted by non-neuronal cells including breast cancer cells that similarly activate intracellular signaling upon binding to their receptors. In this review we dissect the evidence for the emerging paradigm linking neurotransmitters and their receptors with breast cancer. Foremost, we explore the intricacies of such neurotransmitter-receptor interactions, including those that impinge on other cellular components of the tumor microenvironment, such as endothelial cells and immune cells. Moreover, we discuss findings where clinical agents used to treat neurological and/or psychological disorders have exhibited preventive/therapeutic effects against breast cancer in either associative or pre-clinical studies. Further, we elaborate on the current progress to identify druggable components of the psychological-neurological nexus that can be exploited for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer as well as other tumor types. We also provide our perspectives regarding future challenges in this field where multidisciplinary cooperation is a paramount requirement.", "Keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Nerves", "Neurotransmitter receptors", "Neurotransmitters", "Tumor microenvironments"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Breast Neoplasms", "Endothelial Cells", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruo Qi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "General Surgery Department, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Hong", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Qin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "General Surgery Department, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Hubert", "Last Name": "Hondermarck", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rick F", "Last Name": "Thorne", "Affiliation": "Translational Research Institute, Henan Provincial and Zhengzhou City Key laboratory of Non-coding RNA and Cancer Metabolism, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Non-coding RNA and Metabolism in Cancer, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xu Dong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jin Nan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "General Surgery Department, Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Shanxi Academy of Medical Sciences, Tongji Shanxi Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}], "Journal": "Theranostics", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "36792543", "Title": "Two-Dimensional Analysis Method for Highly Sensitive Detection of Dual MicroRNAs in Breast Cancer Cells.", "Abstract": "Multiple biomarker detection is crucial for early clinical diagnosis, and it is significant to achieve the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers with the same nanomaterial. In this work, the hairpin DNA strands were selectively modified on the surface of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to construct two kinds of nanoprobes by rational design. When in the presence of dual microRNAs, AuNRs were assembled to form end-to-end (ETE) and side-by-side (SBS) dimers. Compared with a single AuNR, the dark-field scattering intensity and red color percentage variation of dimers were extremely distinguished, which could be developed for dual microRNA detection by combining the red color percentage and scattering intensity with the data processing method of principal component analysis to construct a two-dimensional analysis method. Especially, the fraction of AuNR dimers presented a linear relationship with the amount of microRNAs. Based on this, microRNA-21 and microRNA Let-7a in breast cancer cells were detected with the detection limits of 1.72 and 0.53 fM, respectively.

For context, we also reviewed patients who received BRAF-directed therapy after surgery, and those who did not have surgery after BRAF-directed therapy. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care cancer center in Texas from 2017 to 2021. Fifty-seven consecutive patients with BRAFV600E-mutated ATC and at least 1 month of BRAF-directed therapy were included. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: All patients had stage IVB (35%) or IVC (65%) ATC. Approximately 70% of patients treated with BRAF-directed therapy ultimately had surgical resection of residual disease. Patients who had neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy followed by surgery (n\u2009=\u200932) had 12-month OS of 93.6% [confidence interval (CI) 84.9-100] and PFS of 84.4% [CI 71.8-96.7]. Patients who had surgery before BRAF-directed therapy (n\u2009=\u200912) had 12-month OS of 74.1% [CI 48.7-99.5] and PFS of 50% [CI 21.7-78.3]. Finally, patients who did not receive surgery after BRAF-directed therapy (n\u2009=\u200913) had 12-month OS of 38.5% [CI 12.1-64.9] and PFS of 15.4% [CI 0-35.0]. Neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy reduced tumor size, extent of surgery, and surgical morbidity score. Subgroup analysis suggested that any residual ATC in the surgical specimen was associated with significantly worse 12-month OS and PFS (OS\u2009=\u200983.3% [CI 62.6-100], PFS\u2009=\u200961.5% [CI 35.1-88]) compared with patients with pathologic ATC complete response (OS\u2009=\u2009100%, PFS\u2009=\u2009100%). Conclusions: We observed that neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy reduced extent of surgery and surgical morbidity. While acknowledging potential selection bias, the 12-month OS rate appeared higher in patients who had BRAF-directed therapy followed by surgery as compared with BRAF-directed therapy without surgery; yet, it was not significantly different from surgery followed by BRAF-directed therapy. PFS appeared higher in patients treated with neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy relative to patients in the other groups. These promising results of neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy followed by surgery for BRAF-mutated ATC should be confirmed in prospective clinical trials.", "Keywords": ["BRAF therapy", "BRAFV600E", "anaplastic thyroid cancer", "neoadjuvant", "surgery", "thyroid cancer"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "Retrospective Studies", "Prospective Studies", "Thyroid Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery;

The electrochemical behavior of TEMPOH is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of TEMPO-mediated redox sequences. However, compared to abundant studies on TEMPOH electrochemistry in aqueous solutions, the sole value of its oxidation potential Eox(TEMPOH) in organic solutions was reported to be 0.7 V (vs Fc in acetonitrile), seemingly conflicting with experimentally observed facile oxidation of TEMPOH. Herein, the electrochemistry of TEMPOH derivatives in acetonitrile was revisited, featuring much smaller oxidation potentials (about 0 V) than literature ones. Acid/base effects and kinetic studies lent credibility to these new values.

Because the treatment mechanism of SWTX in I/R injury remains obscure, we intended to analyze the potential cardioprotective effects of SWTX in rats with myocardial I/R injury. Our research revealed that SWTX prolonged ventricular conduction time in a dose-dependent manner. While SWTX significantly delayed left ventricular signal conduction velocity, it had no effect on left atrial conduction velocity. Under sinus conditions, low SWTX concentrations reduced left ventricular conduction dispersion, while high concentrations increased conduction dispersion. SWTX also prolonged the QRS interval, APD30/50/90, and ERP. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments on myocytes, Ito and Ikr were inhibited by SWTX. While SWTX had no effect on INa, the activation curve for Nav1.5 was left-shifted.

Through employment of their high immunogenicity and nanosize, we have developed a \"Plug-and-Display\" delivery platform on the basis of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for tumor nanovaccines (NanoVac), which can rapidly display different tumor antigens and efficiently eliminate lung metastases of melanoma. In this study, we first upgraded the NanoVac to increase their antigen display efficiency. However, we found that the presence of a subcutaneous xenograft seriously hampered the efficiency of NanoVac to eliminate lung metastases, with the subcutaneous xenograft mimicking the primary tumor burden in clinical practice. The primary tumor secreted significant amounts of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and altered the epigenetic features of granulocyte monocyte precursor cells (GMPs) in the bone marrow, thus disrupting systemic immunity, particularly the function of APCs, and ultimately resulting in NanoVac failure to affect metastases. These changes in the systemic immune macroenvironment were plastic, and debulking surgery of primary tumor resection reversed the dysfunction of APCs and failure of NanoVac. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the formulation design of the tumor nanovaccines themselves, the systemic immune macroenvironment incapacitated by tumor development is another key factor that cannot be ignored to affect the efficiency of tumor nanovaccines, and the combination of primary tumor resection with NanoVac is a promising radical treatment for widely metastatic

overexpressed in approximately 25% of neuroblastomas as the consequence of MYCN gene amplification, has long been postulated to regulate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in neuroblastoma cells, but experimental evidence of this function is presently scant. Here, we show that N-Myc transcriptionally activates the long noncoding RNA MILIP to promote nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair through facilitating Ku70-Ku80 heterodimerization in neuroblastoma cells. High MILIP expression was associated with poor outcome and appeared as an independent prognostic factor in neuroblastoma patients. Knockdown of MILIP reduced neuroblastoma cell viability through the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, retarded neuroblastoma xenograft growth, and sensitized neuroblastoma cells to DNA-damaging therapeutics. The effect of MILIP knockdown was associated with the accumulation of DNA DSBs in neuroblastoma cells largely due to decreased activity of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway. Mechanistical investigations revealed that binding of MILIP to Ku70 and Ku80 increased their heterodimerization, and this was required for MILIP-mediated promotion of NHEJ DNA repair. Disrupting the interaction between MILIP and Ku70 or Ku80 increased DNA DSBs and reduced cell viability with therapeutic potential revealed where targeting MILIP using Gapmers cooperated with the DNA-damaging drug cisplatin to inhibit neuroblastoma growth in vivo. Collectively, our findings identify MILIP as an N-Myc downstream effector critical for activation of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway in neuroblastoma cells, with practical implications of MILIP targeting, alone and in combination with DNA-damaging therapeutics, for neuroblastoma treatment.", "Keywords": ["DNA repair", "MYCN", "N-Myc", "lncRNA", "neuroblastoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "DNA", "DNA

Vin 200-mA- Io capless low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) is developed for a wireless respiration monitoring system. The biaxially driven power transistor (BDP) technique is proposed in the LDO, with a current driven stimulation on the bulk and a voltage on the gate terminal. With the BDP technique, an adaptively biased current-driven loop (ABCL) is designed which can reduce the high threshold voltage of power transistor, thus presenting lower input voltage and reduced power consumption. Moreover, this loop can provide an improved dynamic response due to its increased discharging current. Based on an error amplifier with enhanced DC gain and gain bandwidth, the capless LDO achieves superior power supply rejection (PSR) and stability without a complex frequency compensation mechanism. The proposed LDO is fabricated in the SMIC 180 nm process with a chip area of 0.046 mm 2. Measurement results indicate that this LDO can obtain a 200-mA load current range and greater than -66 dB PSR up to 1 kHz at a supply voltage as low as 0.8 V.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Equipment Design", "Electric Power Supplies", "Electrocardiography", "Amplifiers, Electronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yongqing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhou", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qisheng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sicheng", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuanjin", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "PubDate": "2022Dec"}, {"PMID": "36439456", "Title": "Proteoglycan-4 predicts good prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and inhibits cancer cell migration in vitro.", "Abstract": "To search for adaptive response molecules that affect the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), analyze their clinical correlation with and prognostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and explore their impact on cell biological behavior and their mechanisms of action.", "Keywords": ["epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition", "hepatocellular carcinoma", "proteoglycan 4", "starvation", "transcatheter arterial chemoembolization"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Hong Tao", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Shi Jun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei Li", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Hui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen Bo", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Fang Ting", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Hai Liang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36414080", "Title": "Enhancing the stability of oil-in-water emulsions by non-covalent interaction between whey protein isolate and hyaluronic acid.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of non-covalent interactions between different concentrations (0.1-1.2 %, w/v) of hyaluronic acid (HA) and 3 % (w/v) whey protein isolate (WPI) on the stability of oil-in-water emulsions.

However, in the traditional Z-Scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, the poor charge separation, and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers remain a huge bottleneck. To rationally design S-Scheme (i.e., Step scheme) heterojunctions by avoiding the futile charge transport routes is therefore seen as an attractive approach to achieving high hydrogen evolution rates. Herein, a twin S-scheme heterojunction is proposed involving graphitic C3 N4 nanosheets self-assembled with hydrogen-doped rutile TiO2 nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. This catalyst shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 62.37\u00a0mmol g-1 h-1 and high apparent quantum efficiency of 45.9% at 365\u00a0nm. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer induced by the unique twin S-scheme structure. The charge transfer route in the twin S-scheme is confirmed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping tests. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy, transient-state surface photovoltage (TPV), and other ex situ characterizations further corroborate the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface.

Results showed that LPS reduced WI-38 cell viability, and sinomenine protected cells against LPS-induced viability reduction. Sinomenine concentration-dependently attenuated LPS-induced inflammation by reducing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1, and increasing IL-10 levels. Sinomenine mitigated LPS-induced apoptosis. GSTM1 was screened by matching the targets of sinomenine and pediatric pneumonia. GSTM1 was upregulated in LPS-treated WI-38 cells, and this effect was attenuated after sinomenine treatment.

The short-circuit currents of the assembled glucose/O2 biofuel cells increase at increasing miRNA-141 concentrations, enabling ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-141. The self-powered biosensor features a wide dynamic range for detecting miRNA-141 from 10-17 to 10-11\u00a0M, with an ultralow detection limit of 1.3 aM.

At present, vaccine carrier development often integrates nanocarriers and immune adjuvants.

Herein, we report carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy composites with improved interfacial adhesion by covalent bonding between CFs and the epoxy matrix. This leads to the improved ultimate mechanical properties and enhanced thermal aging performance. Raman mapping demonstrates the formation of an interphase region derived from the covalent bonding between CFs and the epoxy matrix, which enables the uniform fiber distribution and eliminates phase separation during thermal cycling. The covalent attachment of the CF to the epoxy matrix suppresses its migration during temperature fluctuations, preserving the mechanical performance of resulting composites under the thermal aging process. Furthermore, the finite elemental analysis reveals the effectiveness of the chemical treatment of CFs in improving the interfacial strength and toughness of silane-treated CF/epoxy composites.

The electro-Fenton reaction has been extensively used to degrade organic pollutants, but it has not been applied to PEC immunoassays. Herein, we report a novel signaling strategy for a PEC immunoassay based on electro-Fenton degradation of liposomes (Lip) on a photoelectrode. Lip vesicles are coated on Au@TiO2 core-shell photoactive material, which can prevent ascorbic acid (AA) from scavenging photogenerated holes. In the presence of a target, the immunomagnetic bead labels are converted to Fe3+ for electro-Fenton reaction, and hydroxyl radicals generated by the electro-Fenton reaction can degrade the Lip vesicles on the photoelectrode. Because of the degradation of Lip vesicles, photogenerated holes can be scavenged more effectively by AA, leading to an increase in photocurrent.

We discovered that the disease-associated gain-of-function allele Lrrk2G2019S (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis and reprograms cell death pathways in macrophages. When the inflammasome is activated in Lrrk2G2019S macrophages, elevated mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) directs association of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) to mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial GSDMD pore formation then releases mtROS, promoting a switch to RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Consistent with enhanced necroptosis, infection of Lrrk2G2019S mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits hyperinflammation and severe immunopathology. Our findings suggest a pivotal role for GSDMD as an executer of multiple cell death pathways and demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction can direct immune outcomes via cell death modality switching.

Methods: The prognostic signature of GTRGs was constructed via univariate and multivariate Cox analyses after obtaining the expression patterns of GTRGs from the TCGA. A nomogram based on the signature and clinical parameters was established to predict the survival of each HNSCC patient. Potential mechanisms were explored through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, immunotherapy, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) analyses. The expression differences and prognostic efficacy of the signature were verified through the gene expression omnibus (GEO) and several online databases. Results: The prognostic signature was constructed based on five glycosyltransferases (PYGL, ALG3, EXT2, FUT2, and KDELC1) and validated in the GSE65858 dataset. The pathways enriched in the high- and low-risk groups were significantly different. The high-risk group had higher tumor purity; lower infiltration of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and Tregs; higher cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration; lower immune function; and lower checkpoint expression. The signature can also be applied to distinguish whether patients benefit from immunotherapy. In addition, the high-risk group had a higher TMB and more gene mutations, including those in TP53, CSMD1, CDKN2A, and MUC17.

Cancer vaccines induce tumor regression through triggering the specific T-cell responses against tumor neoantigens, a process that can be enhanced by nanocarrier delivery. Inspired by the body's natural immune defenses against bacterial invasion, we have developed two different types of nanocarrier based on bacterial membrane materials, which employ genetically engineered outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs), or hybrid membrane vesicles containing bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, respectively. The OMV-based nanocarriers can rapidly display different tumor antigens through the surface modified Plug-and-Display system, suitable for customized cancer vaccines when the tumor neoantigens can be identified. The hybrid membrane-based nanocarriers are prepared through fusion of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and the primary tumor cell membrane from surgically removed tumor tissues, possessing unique advantages as personalized cancer vaccines when the neoantigens are not readily available. Compared with chemically synthesized nanocarriers such as liposomes and polymer without intrinsic adjuvant properties, owing to the large amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the two nanocarriers can activate the antigen-presenting cells while delivering multiple antigens, thus inducing effective antigen presentation and robust adaptive immune activation. Excluding bacterial culture and tumor tissue collection, the preparation of OMV- and hybrid membrane-based nanocarriers takes ~8 h and 10 h for tumor vaccine construction, respectively.

The control group had a fixed positive end-expiratory pressure\u2009(PEEP) = 5\u2009cmH2O.

There was significant difference in cerebral oxygen saturation and blood glucose level at T4-T6 between the experimental group and the control group (P < 0.05); the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), figure of merit (FOM), and structural similarity (SSIM) of ONLM algorithm were significantly higher than those of NLM algorithm and Bayes Shrink denoising algorithm, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05); there was significant difference in stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) at T4-T6 between the experimental group and the control group (P < 0.05); there was significant difference in pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), and PO2 at T4-T6 between the experimental group and the control group (P < 0.05); pH was higher, and PCO2 and PO2 were lower in the experimental group. The results showed that transesophageal ultrasound based on the ONLM algorithm can accurately assess cardiac function and hemodynamics in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a water-soluble compound of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has a potent anti-inflammatory effect. We conducted a study to explore whether the protective effect of Sal B on iopromide-induced injury in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) is related to inhibition of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signal pathway. The results showed that 100\u2009\u03bcmol/L Sal B counteracted the decrease in cell viability, the increase of ROS and the number of apoptotic cells, and the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) induced by iopromide. Molecular docking analysis showed that Sal B binds TLR4 and NLRP3 proteins. Moreover, 100\u2009\u03bcmol/L Sal B also decreased the expression of TLR4, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB, cleaved caspase-3, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 induced by iopromide. TAK-242, a TLR4 antagonist, was added to further explore the mechanism of Sal B. However, the cotreatment group with TAK-242 and Sal B had no significant difference in cell viability and apoptosis rate compared to the treatment group with TAK-242 or Sal B alone.

"Title": "Response relationship of environmental factors caused by toluene concentration during leaching of capillary zone.", "Abstract": "Due to the leaching of capillary water, the petroleum pollutants initially trapped in vadose zone may migrate to lower aquifer, thus increasing the risk of groundwater pollution. In order to explore the effect of capillary leaching on toluene-contaminated soil and the relationship between toluene concentration (TC) and environmental factors (EFs) during the leaching process, the sterilized and non-sterilized soil column experiments were designed. The EFs were used to estimate TC. The results showed that the difference between leaching and volatilization rates directly determined the changing trend of toluene concentration in capillary water. The toluene concentration in the medium always showed decreasing trend due to leaching. The indigenous microbial community structure of the non-sterilized soil column was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. It was found that indigenous microorganisms could degrade toluene after 33.0 days of acclimatation. The microbial population was dominated by bacteria, among them the Ellin6055 strain and Pseudomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Cupriavidus, Bdellovibrio, Sphingobium, Phenylobacterium, Ramlibacter, Bradyrhizobium, Shinella genera. The Pseudomonas was the most crucial bacterial genus that degraded toluene. Indigenous microbial degradation was the fundamental reason for strong response relationship. Furthermore, we suggested a relationship of function between environmental factors (pH, DO, ORP) and time (t) for toluene attenuation: C0+ln(eAt\u03b1B\u03b3C\u03b2)=CToluene, (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 represent the pH, DO, and ORP in leaching capillary water, respectively; A, B, and C represent undetermined coefficients), and the fitting coefficient R2\u00a0>\u00a00.950. This relationship can only characterize the attenuation process of capillary zone leaching on toluene. However, it may still be utilized to give a theoretical foundation for understanding the dynamic of pollutant concentration change processes under specific environmental factors.", "Keywords": ["Attenuation", "Capillary zone", "Environmental factors", "Leaching", "Response relationship"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Biodegradation, Environmental", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Soil", "Soil Pollutants", "Toluene", "Water", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Zuo", "Affiliation": "College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Engineering Research Center of Groundwater Pollution Control and Remediation, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100875, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Engineering Research Center of Groundwater Pollution Control and Remediation, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100875, China."}, {"First Name": "Kexue", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; Engineering Research Center of Groundwater Pollution Control and Remediation, Ministry of Education, Beijing, 100875, China.

A novel approach, protein structure fingerprint, has been developed to expose the comprehensive local folding variations, and then construct folding conformations for entire protein.

Sequentially, a database was created to collect all possible folding shapes of local folding variations for all permutation of five amino acids. Successively, Protein Folding Variation Matrix (PFVM) assembled all possible local folding variations along sequence for a protein, which possesses several prominent features. First, it showed the fluctuation with certain folding patterns along sequence which revealed how the protein folding was related the order of amino acids in sequence. Second, all folding variations for an entire protein can be simultaneously apprehended at a glance within PFVM. Third, all conformations can be determined by local folding variations from PFVM, so total number of conformations is no longer ambiguous for any protein.

In this paper, a mild aqueous-solution route has been successfully developed for the gram-scale synthesis of three-dimensional porous Pt nanospheres (Pt-NSs) that are composed of network-structured nanodendrites and/or oval multipods. In comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates the dominant metallic-state of Pt and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates the substantial improvement of conductivity for the Pt-NSs/C catalyst. The surfactant-induced porous network nanostructure improves both the catalytic ORR activity and durability. The optimal Pt-NSs/C catalyst exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.898\u2005V (vs. RHE), leading to the mass activity of 0.18\u2005A\u2009mgPt -1 and specific activity of 0.68\u2005mA\u2009cm-2 which are respectively 1.9 and 5.7 times greater than those of Pt/C.

However, knowledge of N. ceranae infecting eastern honey bees is extremely limited. Currently, the mechanism underlying N. ceranae infection is still largely unknown. Based on our previously gained high-quality transcriptome datasets derived from N. ceranae spores (NcCK group), N. ceranae infecting Apis cerana cerana workers at seven days post inoculation (dpi) and 10 dpi (NcT1 and NcT2 groups), comparative transcriptomic investigation was conducted in this work, with a focus on virulence factor-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Microscopic observation showed that the midguts of A. c. cerana workers were effectively infected after inoculation with clean spores of N. ceranae. In total, 1411, 604, and 38 DEGs were identified from NcCK vs. NcT1, NcCK vs. NcT2, and NcT1 vs. NcT2 comparison groups. Venn analysis showed that 10 upregulated genes and nine downregulated ones were shared by the aforementioned comparison groups. The GO category indicated that these DEGs were involved in a series of functional terms relevant to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function such as metabolic process, cell part, and catalytic activity. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the DEGs were engaged in an array of pathways of great importance such as metabolic pathway, glycolysis, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, expression clustering analysis demonstrated that the majority of genes encoding virulence factors such as ricin B lectins and polar tube proteins displayed apparent upregulation, whereas a few virulence factor-associated genes such as hexokinase gene and 6-phosphofructokinase gene presented downregulation during the fungal infection. Finally, the expression trend of 14 DEGs was confirmed by RT-qPCR, validating the reliability of our transcriptome datasets. These results together demonstrated that an overall alteration of the transcriptome of N. ceranae occurred during the infection of A. c. cerana workers, and most of the virulence factor-related genes were induced to activation to promote the fungal invasion.

millions of deaths every year and accounting for 10% of death rate insight into various diseases. The ideal biological wound dressings are expected to possess extraordinary mechanical characterization, cytocompatibility, adhesive properties, antibacterial properties, and conductivity of endogenous electric current to enhance the wound healing process. Recent studies have demonstrated that biomedical hydrogels can be used as typical wound dressings to accelerate the whole healing process due to them having a similar composition structure to skin, but they are also limited by ideal biocompatibility and stable mechanical properties. To extend the number of practical candidates in the field of wound healing, we designed a new structural zwitterion poly[3-(dimethyl(4-vinylbenzyl) ammonium) propyl sulfonate] (SVBA) into a poly-acrylamide network, with remarkable mechanical properties, stable rheological property, effective antibacterial properties, strong adsorption, high penetrability, and good electroactive properties.

However, typical resorbable membranes composed of collagen (Col) have insufficient mechanical properties and high degradation rate, while non-resorbable membranes need secondary surgery. Herein, we designed a photocrosslinkable collagen/polycaprolactone methacryloyl/magnesium (Col/PCLMA/Mg) composite membrane that provided spatiotemporal support effect after photocrosslinking. Magnesium particles were added to the PCLMA solution and Col/PCLMA and Col/PCLMA/Mg membranes were developed; Col membranes and PCL membranes were used as controls. After photocrosslinking, an interpenetrating polymer network was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Col/PCL and Col/PCL/Mg membranes. The elastic modulus, swelling behavior, cytotoxicity, cell attachment, and cell proliferation of the membranes were evaluated. Degradation behavior in vivo and in vitro was monitored according to mass change and by SEM. The membranes were implanted into calvarial bone defects of rats for 8 weeks. The Col/PCL and Col/PCL/Mg membranes displayed much higher elastic modulus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and a lower swelling rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), than Col membranes, and there were no differences in cell biocompatibility among groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The Col/PCL and Col/PCL/Mg membranes had lower degradation rates than the Col membranes, both in vivo and in vitro (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In this study, Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) was used to screen molecular markers associated with salt-alkali tolerance trait in P. trituberculatus. Two DNA mixing pools with significant difference in salt-alkali tolerance were prepared and 94.83G of high-quality sequencing data was obtained. 855 SNPs and 1051 Indels were firstly selected as candidate markers by BSA analysis, out of which, 20 markers were further selected via \u25b3index value (close to 0 or 1) and eight of those were successfully verified. In addition, based on the located information of the markers in genome, eight candidate genes related to salt-alkali tolerance were anchored including ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, aspartate-tRNA ligase, vesicle-trafficking protein, and so on. qPCR results showed that the expression patterns of all these genes changed significantly after salt-alkali stress, suggesting that they play certain roles in salt-alkali adaptation.

Furthermore, due to the similar transmission routes of HBV and HCV, it is highly susceptible to suffer from the cross-infection of HBV and HCV when humans are infected by hepatitis viruses. So it is urgent to develop strategies with high sensitivity to distinguish HBV/HCV and detect their overlapping infection. Herein, a new biosensor named \"hepatitis virus indicator\" for simultaneous detection of HBV and HCV based on the automatic particle enumeration was developed by the combination of Exo III assisted signal amplification strategy and particle counting technology with a dark-field microscopy. The limit of detections (LOD) were as low as 0.194 pM for HBV and 0.169 pM for HCV, respectively. In addition, the proposed method was capable of simultaneously detecting HBV and HCV based on the colorful light scattering from plasmonic nanoparticles. The proposed assay was simple, sensitive and selective for the simultaneous detection of HBV and HCV, which provided a new idea for the early diagnosis of diseases, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV).", "Keywords": ["Automatic particle enumeration", "Hepatitis B virus", "Hepatitis C virus", "Plasmonic nanoparticles"], "MeSH terms": ["Biosensing Techniques", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B virus", "Hepatitis C", "Hepatitis Viruses", "Hepatitis, Viral, Human", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ru", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Fu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hui Hong", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Hui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "The Ninth People's Hospital of Chongqing, No. 69 Jialing Village, Beibei District, Chongqing, 400700, China."}, {"First Name": "Fu Kang", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "The Ninth People's Hospital of Chongqing, No. 69 Jialing Village, Beibei District, Chongqing, 400700, China."}, {"First Name": "Chun Mei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Gao Lin", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210096, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Cheng Zhi", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory on Luminescence and Real-Time Analytical Chemistry (Southwest University), Ministry of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, PR China.

We also proved the applicability of this nanovaccine in identifying the human tumor neoantigens through rapid antigen display.

In this study, the response of toluene to environmental factors during reverse migration and attenuation of toluene from aquifer to vadose zone was studied by column experiment and experimental data analysis. The changes of environmental factors, including potential of hydrogen (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and toluene concentration were monitored by soil column experiment under sterilized and non-sterilized conditions. The 16S rRNA molecular biological detection technology was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of microbial degradation on the environment. Finally, the correlation between environmental factors and concentration in the attenuation process of toluene in the vadose zone was quantitatively studied by Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and multivariate statistical equation. The results showed that pH was primarily affected by microbial degradation, and DO and ORP were primarily affected by both adsorption and microbial degradation. The attenuation of toluene was divided into two stages: adsorption dominated (0~26\u00a0d) and microbial degradation dominated (26~55\u00a0d).

The IM vaccination routes resulted in good protective efficacies in terms of decreasing CIA incidence and severity and significantly improved radiographic and histopathologic findings and scores of joints. Furthermore, IM, SC, and IV vaccinations markedly decreased serum levels of anti-type \u2161 collagen (C\u2161) IgG antibodies, but only IM vaccination significantly reduced serum levels of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. The vaccine exhibited a continuous CCOL2A1-mRNA expression in the tail and abdominal subcutaneous tissue injection sites, but no CCOL2A1-mRNA signal was observed in muscle.

Studying on the geographical distribution pattern and predicting the potential geographical distribution of species are of great significance for developing scientific and effective biodiversity conservation strategies. Plenty of rare and endangered species that need immediate conservation are distributed in Northwest Yunnan. In this regard, this research is conducted in the purpose of predicting the potential geographical distribution of 25 rare and endangered plant species in Northwest Yunnan and analyzing the explanation capabilities of various environmental factors on the potential geographical distribution patterns of these species. Initially, the ecological niche model MaxEnt was employed to predict the potential geographical distribution of target species. Following that, the superposition method was applied to obtain the potential geographical distribution pattern of species richness on the spatial scale of the ecological niche model with a resolution of 0.05\u00b0 \u00d7 0.05\u00b0. Ultimately, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was adopted to investigate the explanation capabilities of various environmental parameters on the potential distribution patterns. The research results showed that the average value of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of each species was between 0.80 and 1.00, which indicated that the simulation accuracy of the MaxEnt model for each species was good or excellent. On the whole, the potential distribution area for each species was relatively concentrated and mainly distributed in the central-western, central-eastern and northern regions of Northwest Yunnan. In addition, the potential distribution areas of these species were between 826.33\u00a0km2 and 44,963.53\u00a0km2. In addition, the annual precipitation (Bio12), precipitation of coldest quarter (Bio19), and population density (Pop) made a greater contribution to the species distribution model, and their contribution values were 25.92%, 15.86%, and 17.95%, respectively. Moreover, the goodness-of-fit R 2 and AIC value of the water model were 0.88 and 7,703.82, respectively, which indicated the water factor largely influenced the potential distribution of these species. These results would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the potential geographical distribution pattern and the distribution of suitable habitats of some rare and endangered plant species in Northwest Yunnan and would be helpful for implementing long-term conservation and reintroduction for these species.", "Keywords": ["MaxEnt", "Northwest Yunnan", "biodiversity conservation", "environmental explanations", "geographically weighted regression", "habitat suitability", "potential geographical distribution"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pengcheng", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China Nanjing China."}, {"First Name": "Guangfu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Biotechnology School of Life Sciences Nanjing Normal University Nanjing China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China Nanjing China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China Nanjing China."}, {"First Name": "Qin", "Last Name": "Si", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China Nanjing China."}, {"First Name": "Jianyong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China Nanjing China."}], "Journal": "Ecology and evolution", "PubDate": "2021Oct"}, {"PMID": "34646389", "Title": "Visualization of endogenous p27 and Ki67 reveals the importance of a c-Myc-driven metabolic switch in promoting survival of quiescent cancer cells.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Recurrent and metastatic cancers often undergo a period of dormancy, which is closely associated with cellular quiescence, a state whereby cells exit the cell cycle and are reversibly arrested in G0 phase. Curative cancer treatment thus requires therapies that either sustain the dormant state of quiescent cancer cells, or preferentially, eliminate them. However, the mechanisms responsible for the survival of quiescent cancer cells remain obscure. Methods: Dual genome-editing was carried out using a CRISPR/Cas9-based system to label endogenous p27 and Ki67 with the green and red fluorescent proteins EGFP and mCherry, respectively, in melanoma cells. Analysis of transcriptomes of isolated EGFP-p27highmCherry-Ki67low quiescent cells was conducted at bulk and single cell levels using RNA-sequencing. The extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate were measured to define metabolic phenotypes. SiRNA and inducible shRNA knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were employed to elucidate mechanisms of the metabolic switch in quiescent cells. Results: Dual labelling of endogenous p27 and Ki67 with differentiable fluorescent probes allowed for visualization, isolation, and analysis of viable p27highKi67low quiescent cells. Paradoxically, the proto-oncoprotein c-Myc, which commonly drives malignant cell cycle progression, was expressed at relatively high levels in p27highKi67low quiescent cells and supported their survival through promoting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In this context, c-Myc selectively transactivated genes encoding OXPHOS enzymes, including subunits of isocitric dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3), whereas its binding to cell cycle progression gene promoters was decreased in quiescent cells. Silencing of c-Myc or the catalytic subunit of IDH3, IDH3\u03b1, preferentially killed quiescent cells, recapitulating the effect of treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors. Conclusion: These results establish a rigorous experimental system for investigating cellular quiescence, uncover the high selectivity of c-Myc in activating OXPHOS genes in quiescent cells, and propose OXPHOS targeting as a potential therapeutic avenue to counter cancer cells in quiescence.", "Keywords": ["IDH3", "c-Myc", "oxidative phosphorylation", "quiescence", "quiescent cells"], "MeSH

However, G. jasminoides presents a relatively long flowering period and different ripening periods, so there are significant differences in the accumulation of metabolites in fruits of different colors. In addition, the complete metabolic pathways of iridoidsand crocins, which are used as medicinal composition of G. jasminoides, are poorly understood at present. In this research, we comprehensively compared the transcriptome and metabolites profiles of the developmental stages and locations of iridoid and crocin biosynthesis. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were detected in four groups of samples, and clear variation in the pattern of metabolite abundance and gene expression were observed among different fruit colors and parts. Geniposide and gardenoside mainly accumulated in the sarcocarp of green fruit (GFS) and the sarcocarp of red fruit (FS), respectively. Crocin mainly accumulated in the peel and sarcocarp of red fruits. In the iridoid pathway, we hypothesized that there was a transport mechanism from the sarcocarp to the peel of G. jasminoides because of the inconsistent expression of G8O, 10-HGO and IS associated with differences in fruit ripening. UGTs play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active components of G. jasminoides. Combined transcriptome and metabonomics analysis showed a negative correlation between the biosynthesis of geniposide and crocin. The redirection of the metabolic flux and the regulation of key enzymes may be the main reasons for the changes in the biosynthesis of iridoid and crocin in G. jasminoides fruit. Our study expended valuable information for functional genomic library and provided new insights for metabolic engineering of secondary metabolite in G.

Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) signaling plays a crucial role in construction of the desmoplastic stroma and provides potential targets for PDAC therapy. To surmount the pathological obstacle, we developed a size switchable nanosystem based on PEG-PLGA nanospheres encapsulated within liposomes for the combined delivery of vactosertib (VAC), a TGF-\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor, and the cytotoxic drug paclitaxel (TAX). By surface modification of the liposomes with a peptide, APTEDB, the nanosystem can be anchored to abundant tumor-associated fibronectin in PDAC stroma and decreases its size by releasing encapsulated TAX-loaded nanospheres, as well as VAC after collapse of the liposomes. The inhibition of ECM hyperplasia by VAC allows TAX more ready access to the cancer cells in addition to its small size, thereby shrinking pancreatic tumor xenografts more effectively than a combination of the free drugs.

Ideally, nucleic acid vaccine should be directly delivered to proper immune cells or tissue (such as lymph nodes). However, current developed vaccines are normally treated through intramuscular injection, where immune cells do not normally reside. Meanwhile, current nucleic acid vaccines must be stored in a frozen state that may hinder their application in developing countries. Here, we report a separable microneedle (SMN) patch to deliver polymer encapsulated spike (or nucleocapsid) protein encoding DNA vaccines and immune adjuvant for efficient immunization. Compared with intramuscular injection, SMN patch can deliver nanovaccines into intradermal for inducing potent and durable adaptive immunity. IFN-\u03b3+CD4/8+ and IL-2+CD4/8+ T cells or virus specific IgG are significantly increased after vaccination. Moreover, in vivo results show the SMN patches can be stored at room temperature for at least 30 days without decreases in immune responses.

However, the inevitable local inflammation after PTT in residual tumor recruits abundant abnormal immune cells, especially the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which further promote immune escape and survival of the remaining tumor cells, resulting in the tumor recurrence and progression. To solve this problem, herein we explored biomimetic nanoparticles carrying repolarization agent of TAMs to remodel the post-PTT inflammatory microenvironment. The polydopamine nanoparticles were used simultaneously as photothermal transduction agents to ablate tumor cells and the delivery vehicles for TMP195 which can repolarize the M2-like TAMs into an antitumor phenotype. In addition, a biomimetic decoration of macrophage membrane coating was designed to endow nanoparticles the ability to actively target the tumor site after PTT mediated by inflammation-mediated chemotaxis. In the breast tumor model, these biomimetic nanoparticles with immune-modulating ability significantly elevated the levels of M1-like TAMs, ultimately resulting in a tumor-elimination rate of 60%, increased from 10% after PTT. This synergistic treatment strategy of PTT and TAMs repolarization provides a promising approach to address the deteriorated tumor microenvironment after PTT and proposes a more effective way for

Magnetic Field (MF) has been a greener and effective technology to control calcium carbonate fouling. However, the effects of MF on composite calcium-silica fouling are still elusive. Therefore, this paper assessed the effect of MF on calcium and silica fouling. We found that MF not only significantly reduce the calcium carbonate fouling, but also obviously decreased the silica fouling. The MF reduced the calcite fouling reached 38.2%-64.3% by changing water quality parameters to trigger the transformation rate of CaCO3 crystal from compact calcite to looser aragonite, as well as increase the unit-cell parameters and chemical bond lengths of calcite and aragonite. The MF also decreased the content of silica fouling (silica and silicate) reached 22.4-46.3% by reducing the concentration of soluble silica and accelerating the flocculation settlement to form large size solid particles in BW. Furthermore, MF broke the synergistic interactions among calcium and silica fouling. In addition, the anti-fouling ability of permanent MF was higher by 12.3-35.1% than electric MF. Overall, these findings demonstrate that MF is an effective and chemical-free technology to control calcium-silica fouling in BWDS, and provide a new perspective for sustainable application of brackish water.", "Keywords": ["Calcium fouling", "Electric magnetic field", "Fouling control", "Permanent magnetic field", "Silica fouling"], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium", "Calcium Carbonate", "Magnetic Fields", "Membranes, Artificial", "Saline Waters", "Silicon Dioxide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zeyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Water-Saving and Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Di Luccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Sciences & Techniques of Navigation and Shipbuilding, University of Cantabria, C/ Gamazo 1, 39004 Santander, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jaume", "Last Name": "Puig-Bargu\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Agricultural Engineering and Technology, University of Girona, Girona 17003, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Water-Saving and Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "Trueba", "Affiliation": "Department of Sciences & Techniques of Navigation and Shipbuilding, University of Cantabria, C/ Gamazo 1, 39004 Santander, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Tahir", "Last Name": "Muhammad", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Water-Saving and Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Water-Saving and Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunkai", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Water-Saving and Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100083, China.

However, the tailor-made efficient delivery system for specific antigens is still urgently needed due to the low immunogenicity and stability of antigens, especially for vaccines to induce CD8+ T cells-mediated cellular immunity. Unlike B cells-mediated humoral immunity, CD8+ T cells-mediated cellular immunity mainly aims at the intracellular antigens from microorganism in virus-infected cells or genetic mutations in tumor cells. Therefore, the vaccines for stimulating CD8+ T cells-mediated cellular immunity should deliver the antigens efficiently into the cytoplasm of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to form major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI)-antigen complex through cross-presentation, followed by activating CD8+ T cells for immune protection and clearance. Importantly, nanotechnology has been emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate these multiple processes specifically, allowing not only enhanced antigen immunogenicity and stability but also APCs-targeted delivery and elevated cross-presentation. This review summarizes the process of CD8+ T cells-mediated cellular immunity induced by vaccines and the technical advantages of nanotechnology implementation in general, then provides an overview of the whole spectrum of nanocarriers studied so far and the recent development of delivery nanotechnology in vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.

This synergistic interaction is particularly important for the formulation of coamorphous pharmaceuticals since the molecular interactions and resulting Tg strongly impact stability against crystallization, dissolution kinetics, and bioavailability. Current models that describe the composition dependence of Tg for binary systems, including the Gordon-Taylor, Fox, Kwei, and Braun-Kovacs equations, fail to describe the behavior of coamorphous pharmaceuticals using parameters consistent with experimental \u0394CP and \u0394\u03b1. Here, we develop a robust thermodynamic approach extending the Couchman and Karasz method through the use of activity coefficient models, including the two-parameter Margules, non-random-two-liquid (NRTL), and three-suffix Redlich-Kister models. We find that the models, using experimental values of \u0394CP and fitting parameters related to the binary interactions, successfully describe observed synergistic elevations and inflections in the Tg versus composition response of coamorphous pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the predictions from the NRTL model are improved when the association-NRTL version of that model is used.

This retrospective study was conducted at a single center in China and aimed to investigate the risk factors for fentanyl-induced cough following general anesthesia in adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 601 adult patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled, and the incidence of FIC during general anesthesia induction and postoperative adverse events were recorded. The risk factors for FIC during general anesthesia induction and postoperative nausea and vomiting were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The incidence of FIC, nausea, and vomiting were 21.8%, 6.3%, and 4.5%, respectively. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that pharyngitis history was associated with an increased risk of FIC during general anesthesia induction (odds ratio [OR]: 2.852; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.698-4.792; P<0.001), whereas use of lidocaine could protect against FIC risk (OR: 0.649; 95% CI: 0.557-0.757; P<0.001).

However, eliciting a robust therapeutic effect with personalized vaccines remains a challenge because of the weak immunogenicity of autologous tumor antigens. Utilizing exogenous prokaryotic constituents that act as adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity is a promising strategy to overcome this limitation. However, nonspecific stimulation of the immune system may elicit an undesirable immunopathological state. To specifically trigger sufficient antitumor reactivity without notable adverse effects, we developed an antigen and adjuvant codelivery nanoparticle vaccine based on Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membranes (EMs) and tumor cell membranes (TMs) from resected autologous tumor tissue. Introduction of the EM into the hybrid membrane nanoparticle vaccines (HM-NPs) induced dendritic cell maturation, thus activating splenic T cells. HM-NPs showed efficacy in immunogenic CT26 colon and 4T1 breast tumor mouse models and also efficiently induced tumor regression in B16-F10 melanoma and EMT6 breast tumor mouse models. Furthermore, HM-NPs provoked a strong tumor-specific immune response, which not only extended postoperative animal survival but also conferred long-term protection (up to 3 months) against tumor rechallenge in a CT26 colon tumor mouse model. Specific depletion of different immune cell populations revealed that CD8+ T and NK cells were crucial to the vaccine-elicited tumor regression.

Thiourea increased N and S functional groups (-NH2, C-N, C=S and S=O). Fe(NO3)3 introduced \u03b3-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and provided Fe2O3@THC with Fe-O. The combination of thiourea and Fe(NO3)3 granted Fe2O3@THC with the largest surface area (33.45\u00a0m2/g), and the highest total pore volume (0.095 cm3/g) among three hydrochars. As(V) adsorption was a physicochemical process involving electrostatic attraction, complexation, ion exchange and H-bond interaction. The maximum As(V) adsorption capacities and partition coefficients decreased as follows: Fe2O3@THC (44.80\u00a0mg/g; 38.44\u00a0L/g) > THC (38.77\u00a0mg/g; 5.94\u00a0L/g) > PHC (19.05\u00a0mg/g; 1.17\u00a0L/g). Three hydrochars exhibited preferable reusability in NaOH solution with only 24.2%, 11.8% and 14.1% decrease in adsorption rates after four cycles for PHC, THC and Fe2O3@THC, respectively. Fe2O3@THC is a promising adsorbent for efficient As(V) removal.

However, it is still not clear whether the responses of plant cuticular waxes to their growing environments are inheritable. We collected seeds of Medicago ruthenica (a perennial legume) populations from 30 growing sites in northern China and examined the variations of leaf cuticular waxes in a common garden experiment. Four wax genes, MrFAR3-1, MrFAR3-2, MrCER1, and MrKCS1, involved in biosynthesis of predominant wax classes (primary alcohol and alkane) and wax precursors, were isolated to test the contributions of genetic variations of the coding sequences (CDS) and the promoter sequences and epigenetic modifications. The plasticity responses of the cuticular waxes were further validated by two stress-modeling experiments (drought and enhancing ultraviolet B). Great variations in total wax coverage and abundance of wax classes or wax compounds were observed among M. ruthenica populations in a common garden experiment. Stress-modeling experiments further validated that M. ruthenica would alter leaf wax depositions under changed growing conditions. The transcriptional levels of the wax genes were positively or negatively correlated with amounts of cuticular waxes. However, the analysis of promoter methylation showed that the methylation level of the promoter region was not associated with their expressions. Although both promoter sequences and CDS showed a number of polymorphic sites, the promoters were not naturally selected and insignificant difference could be observed in the numbers and types of acting elements of the four wax genes among populations. In contrast, the CDS of the wax genes were naturally selected, with a number of missense mutations resulting in alterations of the amino acid as well as their isoelectric points and polarities, which could impact on enzyme function/activity.

The developmental stage and corolla dehiscence of the flower are the important factors affecting the quality of medicinal ingredients. However, neither the regulatory mechanism controlling chlorogenic acids biosynthesis in L. macranthoides nor the molecular basis of effect of corolla dehiscence on the quality of medicinal materials is fully understood. In this study, metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze the metabolic and transcriptional differences of two different cultivars closed bud type (Bt), and flowering type (Ft), as well as the effect of jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) on chlorogenic acids (CGAs) biosynthesis. In total, large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were filtered among three lines of samples. Gene metabolite correlation analyses revealed a 'core set' of 30 genes and 54 genes that were strongly correlated with CGAs biosynthesis and regulating the flowering, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results proved the alterations in the expression levels of genes encoding the pathways involved in CGAs biosynthesis. The ion abundances of CGAs were most significantly increased, while some of the CGAs derived and Caffeoyl-CoA-derived substances showed the most largely reduced abundances in the closed bud type (Bt) compared to the flowering type (Ft). MeJA may leads to the activation of downstream genes in CGAs biosynthesis pathway.

Based on various delivery vehicles, specifically designed nanomaterials-based vaccines are highly advantageous in boosting therapeutic and prophylactic antitumor immunities. Specifically, therapeutic vaccines featuring unique properties have made major contributions to the enhancement of antigen immunogenicity, encapsulation efficiency, biocompatibility, and stability, as well as promoting antigen cross-presentation and specific CD8+ T cell responses. However, for clinical applications, tumor-associated antigen-derived vaccines could be an obstacle, involving immune tolerance and deficiency of tumor specificities, in achieving maximum therapeutic indices. However, when using bioinformatics predictions with emerging innovations of in silico tools, neoantigen-based therapeutic vaccines might become potent personalized vaccines for tumor treatments. In this review, we summarize the development of preclinical therapeutic cancer vaccines and the advancements of nanomaterial-based delivery vehicles for cancer immunotherapies, which provide the basis for a personalized vaccine delivery platform.

osteoporosis. Although previous studies have found that CO has beneficial effects in alleviating osteoporosis, its mechanisms remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we applied system bioinformatic approaches to investigate the possible therapeutic mechanisms of CO against osteoporosis. We collected the active ingredients of CO and their targets from the TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, and ETCM databases. Next, we obtained the osteoporosis targets from differentially expressed mRNAs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) gene series (GSE35958). Next, the shared genes of the CO pharmacological targets and osteoporosis-related targets were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction network, based on the results from the STRING database. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were carried out by using the clusterProfiler package in R software. RESULTS In all, there were 58 unique CO compounds and 518 therapeutic targets. Based on the GO and KEGG enrichment results of 98 common genes, we selected the top 25 terms, based on the terms' P values. We found that the anti-osteoporotic effect of CO may mostly involve the regulation of calcium metabolism and reactive oxygen species, and the estrogen signaling pathway and osteoclast differentiation pathway.

In this study, interaction between the EPS from Lactobacillus plantarum YW11 (EPS-YW11) and whey proteins (WP), and functional properties of the EPS-YW11/WP were investigated. The results showed that EPS-YW11 tended to encase WP by \u03b6-potential analysis with a decrease in the surface charge of the protein fraction (from -26.00\u00a0mV to 15.30\u00a0mV), and an increase in the melting temperature of the protein fraction (from 76.31\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0to 84.48\u00a0\u00b0C)\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0by differential scanning calorimetry.

Previous studies have shown that OMVs induce strong IFN-\u03b3- and T cell-mediated anti-tumor effects in mice. However, IFN-\u03b3 is known to upregulate immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment, especially the immune checkpoint programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which may hamper T cell function and limit immunotherapeutic effectiveness. Here, we report the development of genetically engineered OMVs whose surface has been modified by insertion of the ectodomain of programmed death 1 (PD1). This genetic modification does not affect the ability of OMVs to trigger immune activation. More importantly, the engineered OMV-PD1 can bind to PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and facilitate its internalization and reduction, thereby protecting T cells from the PD1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory axis. Through the combined effects of immune activation and checkpoint suppression, the engineered OMVs drive the accumulation of effector T cells in the tumor, which, in turn, leads to a greater impairment of tumor growth, compared with not only native OMVs but also the commonly used PD-L1 antibody. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the potential of bioengineered OMVs as effective immunotherapeutic agents that can comprehensively regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to effect markedly

Leaf samples from yellow, purple, and white lights were further analyzed, and candidate genes of wax biosynthesis were selected by RNA-seq technology and transcriptome processing. Yellow light increased the total wax coverage and changed the crystal structure compared with leaves under white light. Light wavelengths changed the relative abundance of dominant primary alcohol from C24 under white, yellow, and red lights to C26 under blue and purple lights. In total, 100,194 unigenes were obtained, and 10 genes were annotated in wax biosynthesis pathway, including VLCFAs elongation (KCS1, KCS4, LACS2 and LACS9), acyl reduction pathway (FAR3 and WSD1), and decarboxylation pathway (CER1, CER3 and MAH1). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that yellow and purple lights significantly influenced the expression levels of these genes.

Furthermore, an increased number of sleep disorders, including nighttime problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome was a significant contributor to a poor quality of life (\u03b2\u2009=\u20094.33, CI: 3.33-5.33, P for trend <0.001), even when controlling for multiple factors. Moreover, motor complications partially mediated this relationship (indirect effect: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.355, 95% boot CI: 0.134, 0.652).Our study showed that a large proportion of PD patients suffer from multiple comorbid sleep disorders, which greatly decreases the quality of life in PD patients and is partially mediated by motor complications.", "Keywords": ["Parkinson's disease"], "MeSH

immune-inflammation index (SII) have been identified as predictors of treatment response in a variety of cancers. We conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the usefulness of NLR, PLR and SII at baseline and at 6\u00a0weeks post-treatment as predictors of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatment in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Data of 41 SCLC patients receiving immunotherapy as second- or later-line treatment were analyzed. The overall median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1\u00a0months (95% CI 3.2-6.2). The median PFS was significantly longer in patients with NLR\u2009<\u20095 than in patients with NLR\u2009\u2265\u20095 at 6\u00a0weeks post treatment (HR\u2009=\u20090.29, 95%CI 0.09-0.96, P\u2009=\u20090.04). However, median PFS was comparable between patients with NLR\u2009<\u20095 and patients with NLR\u2009\u2265\u20095 at baseline (HR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.24-2.26, P\u2009=\u20090.56). The median PFS was similar between patients with PLR\u2009<\u2009169 and those with PLR\u2009\u2265\u2009169 at baseline (HR\u2009=\u20090.67, 95% CI 0.25-1.80, P\u2009=\u20090.43) and at 6\u00a0weeks post treatment (HR\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% CI 0.25-1.86, P\u2009=\u20090.46).

The integration of low pH-responsive DNA 'locking strands' outside the nanostructures enables the opening of the vaccine in lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells, exposing adjuvants and antigens to activate a strong immune response.

Studies of Solid-Gas and Solid-Liquid Interfaces.", "Abstract": "Free-standing ultrathin (\u223c2 nm) films of several oxides (Al2O3,TiO2, and others) have been developed, which are mechanically robust and transparent to electrons with Ekin \u2265 200 eV and to photons.

However, it is challenging to maintain the porosity and biodegradability, as well as mechanical properties (especially compressive strength), at the same time. Therefore, in the present work, a biodegradable composite structure of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) was designed using compression molding with varying amounts of poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) (25, 50, 75\u2009wt%) and fixed amount (20\u2009wt%) of beta tricalcium phosphate (beta TCP). It was hypothesized that the fabricated composite structure will develop porosity during the degradation of the PGA and that the corresponding decrease in mechanical properties will be compensated by new bone formation and ingrowth, in vivo. Accordingly, we have systematically studied the effects of sample composition on time-dependent dissolution and mechanical properties of the PGA/beta TCP scaffolds. The compressive strength increased up to ~92\u2009MPa at 50% compression of the designed PCL-PGA samples. Furthermore, the dissolution rate, as well as weight loss, was observed to increase with an increase in the PGA amount in PCL.

This diversification of lipid droplets can promote metabolic flexibility and shape cellular stress responses in unique tissues with distinctive metabolic roles. Using Drosophila, we uncovered a role for myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) in modulating diet-dependent lipid droplet diversification within adult striated muscle, impacting mortality rates. Muscle-specific attenuation of MEF2, whose chronic activation maintains glucose and mitochondrial homeostasis, leads to the accumulation of large, cholesterol ester-enriched intramuscular lipid droplets in response to high calorie, carbohydrate-sufficient diets. The diet-dependent accumulation of these lipid droplets also correlates with both enhanced stress protection in muscle and increases in organismal lifespan. Furthermore, MEF2 attenuation releases an antagonistic regulation of cell cycle gene expression programs, and up-regulation of Cyclin E is required for diet- and MEF2-dependent diversification of intramuscular lipid droplets. The integration of MEF2-regulated gene expression networks with dietary responses thus plays a critical role in shaping muscle metabolism and function, further influencing organismal lifespan.

As the initial Sr2+ concentration increased, the sorption of Sr increased, but the sorption percentage decreased; the sorption percentage reached a maximum at pH\u00a0=\u00a07 and decreased as the acidity or alkalinity of the solution increased.

Cancer immunotherapy, either used alone or in combination with a variety of immunotherapies (such as cancer therapeutic vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, or immune checkpoint blocking therapy), is a very attractive class of cancer therapy. However, so far, the clinical effect of most cancer immunotherapy is not satisfactory. It has been widely recognized that nanotechnology can enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. A variety of biogenic nanoparticles have been developed, which have excellent immunogenicity and modifiability, and can carry tumor therapeutic drugs to achieve combined therapy, so as to improve the effectiveness and durability of antitumor immunity while reducing adverse side effects. In this review, we summarized the key parameters and futures of three kinds of biogenic nanomaterials in cancer immunotherapy; we highlighted the progress of cancer immunotherapy based on outer membrane vesicles, virus-like particles, and exosomes.

In this study, we developed a genome-based identification system named tiger pedigree identification multiplex system (TPI-plex). By analyzing the entire tiger genome, 139,967 STR loci were identified and 12.76% of these displayed three to six alleles among three re-sequenced individual tiger genomes. A total of 204 candidate STRs were identified and screened with a reference population containing 31 unrelated captive tigers. Of these, 15 loci were chosen for inclusion in the multiplex panel. The mean allele number and mean expected heterozygosity (He) were 7.3333 and 0.7789, respectively. The cumulative probability of exclusion (CPE) and total probability of discrimination power (TDP) reached 0.999999472 and 0.999999999999995, respectively.

"Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most common algae found in eutrophicated water bodies. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP) can be produced by Microcystis aeruginosa to utilize organic phosphates under phosphorus deficiency stress, thereby AKP can be regarded as an important indicator for algal growth. Sulfur compounds are ubiquitous in waters, while investigation on the interactions between sulfur compounds and Microcystis aeruginosa is limited. In this work, we introduced 33 types of sulfur compounds to culture Microcystis aeruginosa, and the results demonstrated that algal growth is positively related to AKP activities. Toxicity of organic sulfur compounds was further evaluated using Toxicity Estimation Software Tool based on quantitative structure-activity relationship prediction. The algal growth results exhibited strong correlation to the toxicity endpoints suggesting the organic sulfur compounds inhibits the algal growth as toxic matters. K-means cluster analyses have been carried out subsequently via Python based on the results of algal growth and AKP activities of each sample and statistically, the sulfur compounds can be adequately clustered into 2 groups. According to clustering results, sulfonic acids exhibit low toxicity while sulfur amino acids can be considered as more toxic compounds.

The updated model was implemented to estimate the abatement potential and marginal cost of multiple pollutants in China. The total maximum abatement potentials of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), primary particulate matter (PM2.5), non-volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and ammonia (NH3) in China were estimated to be 19.2, 20.8, 9.1, 17.2 and 8.6\u00a0Mt, respectively, which accounted for 89.7%, 89.9%, 94.6%, 74.0%, and 80.2% of their total emissions in 2014, respectively. The associated control cost of such reductions was estimated as 92.5, 469.7, 75.7, 449.0, and 361.8 billion CNY in SO2, NOx, primary PM2.5, NMVOCs and NH3, respectively. Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces exhibited large abatement potentials for all pollutants.

In this study, the metabolism, distribution, and excretion of EZL were evaluated in chickens after administration of EZL at a single dosage. According to the relevant drug biotransformation rules, the exact molecular mass detection, the fragmentation characteristics, and the retention times, a total of five metabolites were identified in vivo in chickens, including two phase I metabolites and three phase II conjugated metabolites. The major metabolic pathways of EZL in chickens were deacetylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation. Regarding 14C-tissue residues after administration, kidney was considered to be the target tissue, as 14C-tissue residues could be detected at 240 h postdose. DeacetylEZL (M3) was the main metabolite, accounting for 68.65% and 25.62% of 14C in kidney at 6 and 24 h, respectively. In heart, muscle, skin+fat, and lung tissues, EZL was the main radioactive substance accounting for 94.88%, 97.32%, 96.23%, and 91.3% of 14C, respectively. In the liver, EZL and M3 were 20.76% and 54.65% of 14C, respectively. In chicken tissues the ratio of M5 was too low to be quantitated and it was mainly detected in chicken fecal and bile samples. In chicken excreta, EZL, M3, and glucuronidation of EZL (M5) accounted for 7.02%, 12.33%, and 10.32% of the dose, respectively and were eliminated primarily. This study presents the first detection of EZL metabolites, which is helpful for further understanding of the metabolic mechanism and in vivo intermediate processes of EZL.

The accurate inversion of water quality parameters in sewage with visible-near infrared spectroscopy can improve the effectiveness and rational utilization and management of water resources. However, the accuracy of spectral models of water quality parameters is usually prone to noise information and high dimensionality of spectral data. This study aimed to enhance the model accuracy through optimizing the spectral models based on the sensitive spectral intervals of different water quality parameters. To this end, six kinds of sewage water taken from a biological sewage treatment plant went through laboratory physical and chemical tests. In total, 87 samples of sewage water were obtained by adding different amount of pure water to them. The raw reflectance (Rraw) of the samples were collected with analytical spectral devices. The Rraw-SNV were obtained from the Rraw processed with the standard normal variable. Then, the sensitive spectral intervals of each of the six water quality parameters, namely, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), NH3-N, the total dissolved substances (TDS), total hardness (TH) and total alkalinity (TA), were selected using three different methods: gray correlation (GC), variable importance in projection (VIP) and set pair analysis (SPA). Finally, the performance of both extreme learning machine (ELM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was investigated based on the sensitive spectral intervals. The results demonstrated that the model accuracy based on the sensitive spectral ranges screened through different methods appeared different. The GC method had better performance in reducing the redundancy and the VIP method was better in information preservation. The SPA method could make the optimal trade-offs between information preservation and redundancy reduction and it could retain maximal spectral band intervals with good response to the inversion parameters. The accuracy of the models based on varied sensitive spectral ranges selected by the three analysis methods was different: the GC was the highest, the SPA came next and the VIP was the lowest. On the whole, PLSR and ELM both achieved satisfying model accuracy, but the prediction accuracy of the latter was higher than the former. Great differences existed among the optimal inversion accuracy of different water quality parameters: COD, BOD and TN were very high; TA relatively high; and TDS and TH relatively low. These findings can provide a new way to optimize the spectral model of wastewater biochemical parameters and thus improve its prediction precision.", "Keywords": ["Band screen", "Extreme learning machine", "Gray correlation method", "Hyperspectral remote sensing", "Set pair analysis", "Variable importance projection analysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Junying", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xianwen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhitao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Congcong", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Haifeng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China."}], "Journal": "PeerJ", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31799765", "Title": "A Bioinspired Nanoprobe with Multilevel Responsive T1 -Weighted MR Signal-Amplification Illuminates Ultrasmall Metastases.", "Abstract": "Metastasis remains the major cause of death in cancer patients. Thus, there is a need to sensitively detect tumor metastasis, especially ultrasmall metastasis, for early diagnosis and precise treatment of cancer.

By conjugating the ultrasmall manganese ferrite nanoparticles (UMFNPs) with a tumor-targeting penta-peptide CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala), ultrasmall breast cancer metastases are accurately detected. With a behavior similar to neutrophils' immunosurveillance process for eliminating foreign pathogens, UMFNP-CREKA exhibits a chemotactic \"targeting-activation\" capacity. UMFNP-CREKA is recruited to the margin of tumor metastases by the binding of CREKA with fibrin-fibronectin complexes, which are abundant around tumors, and then release of manganese ions (Mn2+ ) to the metastasis in response to pathological parameters (mild acidity and elevated H2 O2 ). The localized release of Mn2+ and its interaction with proteins affects a marked amplification of T1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signals.

However, the current thrombolysis strategies offer limited results due to the therapeutics' short half-lives, low targeting ability, and unexpected bleeding complications. Inspired by the innate roles of platelets in hemostasis and pathological thrombus, platelet membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles (nanoplatelets) are developed for targeting delivery of the thrombolytic drug, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), to local thrombus sites. The tailor-designed nanoplatelets efficiently accumulate at the thrombi in pulmonary embolism and mesenteric arterial thrombosis model mice, eliciting a significantly enhanced thrombolysis activity compared to free rt-PA.

In this study, the cold-stress response of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum K25 isolated from Tibetan kefir grains was analyzed by iTRAQ proteomic method. By comparing differentially expressed (DE) protein profiles of the strain incubated at 10\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, 506 DE proteins were identified. The DE proteins involved in carbohydrate, amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were significantly down-regulated, leading to a specific energy conservation survival mode. The DE proteins related to DNA repair, transcription and translation were up-regulated, implicating change of gene expression and more protein biosynthesis needed in response to cold stress. In addition, two-component system, quorum sensing and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters also participated in cell cold-adaptation process.

However, it is difficult to maintain the mechanical properties as well as biodegradability and porosity (necessary for bone ingrowth) at the same time. Therefore, in the present study, polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA5050) were mixed in varying ratio and incorporated with 20 wt.% \u03b2TCP. The mixture was shaped under pressure into originally non-porous cylindrical constructs. It is envisioned that the fabricated constructs will develop porosity with the time-dependent biodegradation of the polymer blend. The mechanical properties will be sustained since the decrease in mechanical properties associated with the dissolution of the PLGA and the formation of the porous structure will be compensated with the new bone formation and ingrowth. To prove the hypothesis, we have systematically studied the effects of samples composition on the time-dependent dissolution behavior, pore formation, and mechanical properties of the engineered samples, in vitro. The highest initial (of as-prepared samples) values of the yield strength (0.021\u00b10.002 GPa) and the Young's modulus (0.829\u00b10.096 GPa) were exhibited by the samples containing 75 wt.% of PLGA. Increase of the PLGA concentration from 25 wt.% to 75 wt.% increased the rate of biodegradation by a factor of 3 upon 2 weeks in phosphate buffered saline (1\u00d7 PBS).

To circumvent these problems, in this study, polymeric nanoparticles were utilized to codeliver a water-soluble CDDP derivative, poly(\u03b3,l-glutamic acid)-CDDP conjugate, and a naturally occurring compound derived from broccoli, sulforaphane, which can achieve efficient glutathione (GSH) depletion, to improve the accumulation of CDDP in cancer cells. Results show that compared with combinational treatment of CDDP and SFN, the nanoparticles were more effectively internalized and could significantly reduce GSH content in breast cancer cells, leading to a notable increase in DNA-bound Pt and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in an orthotopic breast cancer model, the nanoparticles achieved a significantly higher tumor accumulation and exhibited a more powerful antitumor activity.

Inulin is one of the most common prebiotics that exhibit twisted hydrocolloidal properties in dairy products. The present study was designed to develop a synbiotic yogurt by incorporation of S. boulardii and inulin at 1%, 1.5%, and 2% (w/v), comparing with the probiotic and control plain yogurts. Microrheological, microstructural, microbiological, sensory properties, and volatile compounds of the yogurt samples were evaluated. Microrheological analysis showed that addition of inulin to yogurt slightly reduced the values of G' and G\u2033, while solid-liquid balance (SLB) values confirmed more solid properties of the synbiotic yogurt (0.582~0.595) than the plain yogurt (0.503~0.518). A total of 18 volatile compounds were identified in the synbiotic yogurt, while only five and six compounds were identified in plain and probiotic yogurts, respectively. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, acidity, and protein content were in the normal range (as with the control), while fat content in the synbiotic yogurt decreased significantly. Addition of 1% inulin not only reduced syneresis but also maintained viability of S. boulardii after 28 days of storage. Microstructural and microrheological studies confirmed the dense, compressed, homogeneous structure of the synbiotic yogurt. Thus, addition of inulin improved the textural and sensory properties of the synbiotic yogurt, as well as survival of S. boulardii with viable count above 6.0 log CFU/g in yogurt, as generally required for probiotics. Therefore, novel synbiotic yogurt with desirable quality was developed as an effective carrier for delivery of the probiotic yeast exerting its beneficial health effects.", "Keywords": ["Saccharomyces boulardii", "inulin", "prebiotics", "probiotics", "synbiotic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abid", "Last Name": "Sarwar", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. abiduomian@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Tariq", "Last Name": "Aziz", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. iwockd@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Al-Dalali", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. salihsam4@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. zhaoxiao0828@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. zhangjian@btbu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jalal", "Last Name": "Ud Din", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. jalal4827@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Dongjun Dairy (Yucheng) Co., Ltd., Yucheng 251200, China. chaochen266@163.co."}, {"First Name": "Yongqiang", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Dongjun Dairy (Yucheng) Co., Ltd., Yucheng 251200, China. caoyongqiang91@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Zhennai", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center of Food Additives, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China. yangzhennai@th.btbu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Foods (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2019Oct10"}, {"PMID": "31629710", "Title": "Cutaneous microenvironment responsive microneedle patch for rapid gene release to treat subdermal tumor.", "Abstract": "Transdermal gene therapy is a useful treatment for many skin lesions. By penetrating stratum corneum directly, microneedle patch (MNP) has been widely investigated to improve transdermal gene delivery. However, considering the operability and patience compliance, quick gene release was required after insertion. In this research, by utilizing acidic cutaneous environment, pH-responsive polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) were coated on the surface of polycaprolactone (PCL) microneedles by layer-by-layer assembly to realize rapid gene release. Dimethylmaleic anhydride-modified polylysine (PLL-DMA), a charge reversible polymer, was introduced to PEM. The PEM composed of two parts: the transition layers of (PLL-DMA/polyethyleneimine)12 and the gene-loaded layers of (p53 expression plasmid/polyethyleneimine)16. Microneedle patch modified with such PEM was marked as tr-MNP. In following experiment, Hoechst 33258 dyed model DNA was used to track modification process, fluorescent intensity of tr-MNP was obviously strengthened while the number of bilayers increased and the morphology could be maintained. Each tr-MNP could load 31\u03bcg model DNA and improve gene release. To prove this character, MNP without transition layers (ntr-MNP) was fabricated as control. Tr-MNP could release 33% of model DNA in simulative cutaneous environment (phosphate buffer saline; pH=5.5) while ntr-MNP could only release 4%. That was because PLL-DMA could achieve charge reversal in acidic cutaneous environment, leading to the collapse of transition layers and promoted the gene release. In vivo experiment showed tumor inhibit efficacy of tr-MNP treated mice could reach 90.1% while that of ntr-MNP treated mice and intravenous administration mice was only 46.4% and 30.5%.

However, the performance of SACs lags far behind that of state-of-the-art Pt due to the unsatisfactory adsorption-desorption behaviors of the reported catalytic centers. To address this issue, rational manipulation of the active site configuration toward a well-managed energy level and geometric structure is urgently desired, yet still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to accomplish this task through the construction of an Fe-Co dual-atom centered site. A spontaneously absorbed electron-withdrawing OH ligand was proposed to act proactively as an energy level modifier to empower easy intermediate desorption, while the triangular Fe-Co-OH coordination facilitates O-O bond scission. Benefiting from these attributes, the as-constructed FeCoN5-OH site enables an ORR onset potential and half-wave potential of up to 1.02 and 0.86 V (vs RHE), respectively, with an intrinsic activity over 20 times higher than the single-atom FeN4 site.

High quality vaccines for Brucella are urgently needed to effectively reduce the incidence of brucellosis. OMP2b and BCSP31 are important component proteins of the Brucella outer membrane and are highly immunogenic. Here, we used the bioinformatics software ProtParam, SOPMA, SWISS-MODEL, Rasmol, BepiPred, SYFPEITHI and IEDB to analyze the structure of these two proteins and predict the epitopes of T cells and B cells. Through analysis, we predicted three Th cell epitopes, seven CTL epitopes, eight B cell epitopes, and one T-B combined epitope of OMP2b protein. Subsequently, we also obtained three Th cell epitopes, six CTL epitopes, nine B cell epitopes and one T-B combined epitope of BCSP31 protein. The T-B combined epitopes and CTL epitopes of OMP2b and those of BCSP31 were synthesized to detect their immunogenicity. The IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay showed that the T-B combined epitope peptides of OMP2b and BCSP31 activated Th cell immune responses. ELISA analysis detected the specific antibodies against the T-B combined epitope peptide of OMP2b and BCSP31 in the serum of Brucellosis patients. Additionally, CTL epitope peptide of OMP2b and BCSP31 proteins promoted the secretion of soluble perforin and granzyme B in the culture supernatant.

The coagulation and settleability of sediment particles were tested under simulated storm weather conditions, i.e., low temperature (7 \u00b0C) and in the presence of various types and concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM) that was extracted from the local sediments. Experimental results proved that elevated NOM (6.14 mg\u00b7L-1 as Total Organic Carbon, TOC) in raw water was the root cause for the failure of the plant while the low temperature played a minor but significant role. Pre-oxidation with permanganate and/or elevated coagulant dosage were found effective to remove TOC in raw water and to prevent similar treatment failure.

Briefly, ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide nanoring (FVIO)-mediated mild magnetic hyperthermia caused calreticulin (CRT) expression on the 4T1 breast cancer cells. The CRT expression transmitted an \"eat-me\" signal and promoted phagocytic uptake of cancer cells by the immune system to induce an efficient immunogenic cell death, further leading to the macrophage polarization. This mild thermotherapy promoted 88% increase of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in distant tumors and triggered immunotherapy by effectively sensitizing tumors to the PD-L1 checkpoint blockade. The percentage of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be further increased from 55.4% to 64.5% after combining with PD-L1 blockade. Moreover, the combination treatment also inhibited the immunosuppressive response of the tumor, evidenced by significant down-regulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

In this paper, a series of microporous ceramic filter membranes were prepared using inexpensive standard sand and river sand as matrix materials. Semi-empirical formula for the effective permeability radius of ceramic membranes with respect to time was established from analysis of the response mechanism between water flow and material properties. Finally, on the basis of theoretical analysis, some measures were proposed to improve permeate flux. The experimental results showed that during the initial stage of filtration, the microporous ceramic filter membrane had a large change in permeate flux, and during the late stage of filtration, permeate flux tended to be stable. Over time, open porosity and closed porosity changed the actual seepage area of the ceramic membrane, and this affected the stability of permeate flux and final stable permeate flux. The roughness of the inner wall of microporous ceramic pores affected the hydraulic loss coefficient, and this controlled the outflow process. Trace elements that were rich in sand produced a large amount of glass phase after sintering. The glass phase was rich in polar groups and formed a temporary hydrogen bond with the small flow of water molecules. It led to an increase in viscous resistance effect of the side wall along the water flow and the extent of the permeate flux of the ceramic membrane changed with time.", "Keywords": ["filter", "flow rate", "membrane", "microporous ceramic", "permeability stability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Pute", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China. gjzwpt@vip.sina.com."}, {"First Name": "Yaohui", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunping", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas, Ministry of Education, Northwest A&F University, Xianyang 712100, China."}], "Journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2019Jul05"}, {"PMID": "31275710", "Title": "Production, purification and characterization of a milk clotting enzyme from Bacillus methanolicus LB-1.", "Abstract": "Bacillus methanolicus LB-1 isolated from traditional rice wine was found to produce a milk clotting enzyme (MCE), and its fermentation conditions were optimized using response surface methodology.

Targeting tumor-associated TF has therefore great therapeutic potential for antimetastasis therapy and preventing thrombotic complication in cancer patients. Herein, we reported a novel peptide-based nanoparticle that targets delivery and release of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the tumor site to silence the expression of tumor-associated TF. We showed that suppression of TF expression in tumor cells blocks platelet adhesion surrounding tumor cells in vitro. The downregulation of TF expression in intravenously administered tumor cells (i.e., simulated circulating tumor cells [CTCs]) prevented platelet adhesion around CTCs and decreased CTCs survival in the lung. In a breast cancer mouse model, siRNA-containing nanoparticles efficiently attenuated TF expression in the tumor microenvironment and remarkably reduced the amount of lung metastases in both an experimental lung metastasis model and tumor-bearing mice. What's more, this strategy reversed the hypercoagulable state of the tumor bearing mice by decreasing the generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and activated platelets, both of which are downstream products of TF.

This all-in-one method allows for the one-to-one, in situ/operando, and atomic-scale correlation between structures of electrocatalysts with their electrochemical reactivities, distinct from common methods that adopt multisamples separately for electrochemical and physical characterizations. Because the atomic step is one of the most fundamentally structural elements in electrocatalysts, we demonstrated the feasibility of ISM by exploring the roles of atomic steps in the reactivity of electrocatalysts. In situ and atomic-scale evidence shows that low-coordinated atomic steps not only generate reactive species at low potentials and strengthen surface contraction but also act as templates to disturb interfacial water networks and thus affect the reactivity of electrocatalysts. This template role interprets the long-standing puzzle regarding why high-index facets are active for the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media.

In particular, two influential models (i.e., the encoding variability hypothesis and the study-phase retrieval hypothesis) could both model behavioral performance very well, but they make opposite hypotheses regarding the spacing effect's neural mechanisms. The present study attempted to provide empirical neural evidence to adjudicate these competing hypotheses. Using spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) analysis of EEG data, this study investigated whether and how repetition lags (massed/short-spaced/long-spaced) modulated the STPS's contribution to episodic memory encoding in male and female human participants. The results revealed that greater item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes at 543-727 ms after stimulus onset was associated with better memory performance. More importantly, this STPS was larger under the spaced-learning condition than the massed-learning condition and partially mediated the spacing effect on memory performance. In addition, we found that massed learning was associated with stronger repetition suppression in the N400 component that reflected momentary retrieval strength, but reduced activity in the late positive component that was associated with memory retrieval. These results suggest that spaced learning improves long-term memory by increasing retrieval effort and enhancing the pattern reinstatement of prior neural representations, which may be achieved by reducing the momentary retrieval strength as the extended repetition lags might help to eliminate the residual representation in working memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT As one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental phenomena in the history of memory research, the spacing effect provides an important window into understanding how enduring memory is formed in the brain and how different practice strategies could modulate these mechanisms to affect memory performance. By leveraging the neural representational analysis on scalp EEG data, the current study provides the first empirical data to show that spaced learning enhances memory by improving the spatiotemporal similarity that occurs at a late time window.

The initial proteolysis assay of the microbial rennet on milk proteins indicated a notable increase in the hydrolysis of casein components (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03ba-caseins) but no effect on whey proteins upon increasing the concentration of the enzyme. Correspondingly, compared to cheese made with commercial rennet, the use of the microbial rennet in Cheddar-style cheese resulted in significantly higher primary and secondary proteolysis in the later stages of ripening (60-90\u00a0days ripening) and thus a softer texture and the formation of more volatile compounds and free amino acids (FAAs) despite its lower moisture content (41.7%, w/w).

TMG-chitotriomycin and its analogues show different activities to OfHex1, dependent on the number of GlcNAc units. Subsequently, it is essential to explore how these GlcNAc unit number changes cause alterations in activity. In this study, we examined the free energy patterns and per residue decomposition of binding within the complexes of OfHex1 and a series of inhibitors, utilizing restricted molecular dynamics (MD) and water-mediated MM/GBSA calculations. The results indicated Glu328 could form a stronger polar interaction with OfHex1 inhibitors, while Trp448 and Trp490 had important non-polar contributions. Interestingly, the conformation of Trp448 was different in the open or closed state, when OfHex1 bound different inhibitors. Moreover, the water molecule that mediates the GlcNAc \u2161 and Trp490 may be critical to stabilizing the hydrophobic interaction. Further study showed that isomerization of TMG-chitotriomycin analogs did not decrease binding affinity, however, there was a highly positive correlation between the calculated binding affinities and the experimental activity data (r2\u202f=\u202f0.92) when water molecules were explicitly taken into account. Moreover, the water molecules that mediated GlcNAc II and Trp490 might be critical to the stabilization of the hydrophobic interaction and cause the activity difference between TMG-(GlcNAc)2 and TMG-(GlcNAc).", "Keywords": ["Inhibitor", "Isomerization", "MM/GBSA", "OfHex1", "Solvation effect"], "MeSH terms": ["Catalytic Domain", "Chitin", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Insect Proteins", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Sugar Alcohols", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Song", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China."}, {"First Name": "Yawen", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.

However, the unbinding routes of ligands from OfHex1 still remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we first simulated the six dissociation routes of N,N,N-trimethyl-d-glucosamine-chitotriomycin (TMG-chitotriomycin, a highly selective inhibitor of OfHex1) from the active pocket of OfHex1 by steered molecular dynamics simulations. By comparing the potential of mean forces (PMFs) of six routes, Route 1 was considered as the most possible route with the lowest energy barrier. Furthermore, the structures of six different states for Route 1 were snapshotted, and the key amino acid residues affecting the dissociated time were analyzed in the unbinding pathway. Moreover, we also analyzed the \"open\u207bclose\" mechanism of Glu368 and Trp448 and found that their conformational changes directly affected the dissociation of TMG-chitotriomycin.

Recent research has found that most pancreatic cancers develop resistance to the current first-line chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine (Gem), and high expression of Mcl-1 can reduce the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to Gem chemotherapy. Therefore, novel strategies, such as combination therapy, to overcome resistance of Gem chemotherapy are needed urgently. Here, we employed a lipid-based delivery system (LPs) to codeliver Mcl-1 siRNA and Gem for pancreatic cancer treatment, named LP-Gem-siMcl-1. LP-Gem-siMcl-1 exhibited an increased cellular uptake, enhanced Mcl-1 down-regulation efficacy, and significant cytotoxicity in the human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PANC-1 and BxPC-3. Furthermore, tumor inhibition in vivo proved that LP-Gem-siMcl-1 has higher anti-tumor efficiency than LP-siMcl-1 plus LP-Gem, indicating the synergistic anti-tumor effects of Gem and siMcl-1. Meanwhile, histological analysis demonstrated that LPs could efficiently co-deliver Gem and Mcl-1 siRNA to cancerous cells and overcome the resistance of Gem.

Gene expression profile datasets of NPC and OSCC were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 1279 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of NPC and 1293 DEGs of OSCC were identified by fold change and empirical Bayes method, and 278 DEGs were common to these two diseases. These overlapped genes were translated into a primary network consisting of 1290 nodes (genes) and 1766 edges. The primary network was then decomposed into 15 compacted modules (subnets) with high modularity by Newman's algorithm. Topological analysis of these modules identified a total of 58 hub genes, most of which (e.g., PCNA, CDK1, STAT1, CCL5, and MMP1) have been proved to be associated with NPC and/or OSCC, while the rest (e.g., MELK, NME1, RACGAP1, INHBA, and NID1) might be novel risk genes for the two diseases.

Thus, iron-removing drugs, iron chelators, have potential applications in cancer treatment. Deferoxamine (DFO) is an efficient iron chelator, but its short circulation half-life and ability to induce hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) overexpression restricts its use as an antitumor agent. In the present study, we first found that a pattern of iron-related protein expression favoring higher intracellular iron closely correlates with shorter overall and relapse-free survival in pancreatic cancer patients. We subsequently found that a combination of DFO and the HIF1\u03b1 inhibitor, lificiguat (also named YC1), significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of DFO in vitro. We then employed transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) targeting liposomes to codeliver DFO and YC1 to pancreatic tumors in a mouse model. The encapsulation of DFO prolonged its circulation time, improved its accumulation in tumor tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and facilitated efficient uptake by cancer cells, which express high level of TFR1. After entering the tumor cells, the encapsulated DFO and YC1 were released to elicit a synergistic antitumor effect in subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenografts. In summary, our work overcame two major obstacles in DFO-based cancer treatment through a simple liposome-based drug delivery system.

After product purification, different fluorescent-labeled DNA products were qualitatively analyzed by the fluorescent intensity determination. The sensitivity and specificity of the system was examined using four kinds of genetically modified (GM) maize. The qualitative results revealed high specificity and sensitivity of 0.5% (w/w). In addition, the quantitative results revealed that the absolute limit of detection was 103 copies, showing good repeatability. Moreover, the reproducibility assays were further performed using four foodborne pathogenic bacteria to further evaluate the applicability of the system. Consequently, the same qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput results were confirmed with the four GM maize.

Bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has been reported to improve the intestinal epithelial barrier function, but its impact on tight junction (TJ) proteins has been rarely described. Human intestinal epithelial crypt cells (HIECs) were more similar to those in the human small intestine, compared with the well-established Caco-2 cells. Accordingly, both HIECs and Caco-2 cells were investigated in this study to determine the effects of bioactive protein bLF on their growth promotion and intestinal barrier function. The results showed that bLF promoted cell growth and arrested cell-cycle progression at the G2/M-phase. Moreover, bLF decreased paracellular permeability and increased alkaline phosphatase activity and transepithelial electrical resistance, strengthening barrier function. Immunofluorescence, western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that bLF significantly increased the expression of three tight junction proteins-claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1-at both the mRNA and protein levels, and consequently strengthened the barrier function of the two cell models. bLF in general showed higher activity in Caco-2 cells, however, HIECs also exhibited desired responses to barrier function.

Skin ECM homeostasis is maintained by a complex process that involves an integration of cytokine and environmental mediators. However, it is unclear, in both normal and disease states, how these multifactorial processes converge to shift ECM homeostasis towards accumulation or degradation. Here we show a consistent downregulation in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and upregulation of glycolysis in fibrotic skin and in normal skin with abundant ECM. Perturbation of glycolysis and FAO pathway enzymes reveals their reciprocal effects in ECM upregulation and downregulation, respectively. Increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling, an inducer of the FAO pathway, generates a catabolic fibroblast phenotype characterised by inhibition of ECM transcription and enhanced ECM internalization and lysosomal degradation. In contrast, suppression of glycolysis inhibits ECM gene transcription and protein levels, independently of an intact FAO pathway or PPAR signalling. Moreover, we show that CD36, a multifunctional fatty acid transporter, connects the metabolic state of fibroblasts with their capacity for ECM regulation, as internalization and degradation of collagen-1 is abrogated in fibroblasts lacking CD36. Finally, restoring FAO and upregulating CD36 reduces ECM accumulation in murine skin fibrosis.

The polycarboxybetaine was found to have a low polydispersity (PDI) of 1.214, and its molecular weight was determined as 70590 g/mol via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements. Spherical, rodlike, and fractal assembled structures for the P(DACRO-MAA) were observed with pH change using TEM, zeta sizer, and dynamic light scattering (DLS).

Current treatment regiments have a low response rate in unselected patients. However, the subgroup of PCa patients with BRCA mutations may benefit from poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) due to their biological properties in DNA repair. Dose-limiting toxicity in normal tissues is frequently observed when PARPi are combined with other chemotherapies, and the co-delivery of two drugs to tumor sites at an adequate concentration is challenging. To address this issue, we have engineered an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting (with GE11 peptide) self-assembly amphiphilic peptide nanoparticle (GENP) to co-deliver gemcitabine and the PARPi olaparib to treat BRCA mutant PCa. The GENP was relatively stable, exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, and could coordinately release the two drugs in tumor milieu. Gemcitabine and olaparib showed strong synergistic actions in optimized conditions in vitro. The nanoparticle prolonged the half-life of both drugs and resulted in their tumor accumulation at the optimal therapeutic ratio in vivo. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were able to significantly suppress tumor growth in a murine PCa model with minimal side effects.

To investigate the cellular machinery involved in miR-185's regulation of tumor growth, it was found that miR-185 directly targets SRY-Box 13 (SOX13). In addition, miR-185 regulated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and increased chemo-sensitivity in H1975 cells by inhibiting SOX13. MiR-185 also inhibited tumor growth and suppressed SOX13 in nude mouse xenograft tumors. To investigate the clinical relevance of these consequences, 24 pairs of NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected to determine expression of miR-185 and SOX13.

However, due to its hydrophilicity and zwitterionic nature, the transdermal delivery of ALA is limited for the PDT of subcutaneous tumor. To address this problem, tip-loaded fast-dissolving microneedles made of sodium hyaluronate (HA) were fabricated by two casting method. 122\u202f\u03bcg of ALA was loaded per microneedle patch and mainly distributed in the tips, which could improve the utilization of drug and avoid the waste of drug residue in the base of microneedle patch after use.

The natural characters and facile isolation of original cells facilitate the biomedical applications of plasma membranes in functionalizing nanocarriers. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been identified to show tropism toward malignant lesions and have great advantages in ease of acquisition, low immunogenicity, and high proliferative ability. Here, we developed a poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle with a layer of plasma membrane from umbilical cord MSC coating on the surface for tumor-targeted delivery of chemotherapy. Functionalization of MSC plasma membrane significantly enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency of PLGA nanoparticles, the tumor cell killing efficacy of PLGA-encapsulated doxorubicin, and most importantly the tumor-targeting and accumulation of the nanoparticles. As a result, this MSC-mimicking nanoformulation led to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and induced obvious apoptosis within tumor lesions.

They act by inducing potent immune tolerance instead of generalized immunosuppression. Recently, we developed a novel antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 coding for chicken type II collagen (CCII) and confirmed its potent therapeutic efficacy in an established rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Here we report the prophylactic vaccination efficacy of a single 300\u2009\u03bcg/kg dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 against CIA incidence, severity, and onset. CCOL2A1 transcripts were detected in the blood of CIA rats 14-42 days after intramuscular injection by 300\u2009\u03bcg/kg pcDNA-CCOL2A1. The expression of CCOL2A1 transcripts increased quickly on day 21, peaked at day 28, and then gradually decreased thereafter. Importantly, a single prophylactic vaccination of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 14 days before CIA establishment significantly reduced CIA incidence and severity, deferred its onset, and was as efficacious as the current gold standard drug, methotrexate. The marked effects on CIA incidence and severity closely corresponded to the expression of CCOL2A1. Furthermore, prophylactic vaccination with pcDNA-CCOL2A1 markedly decreased serum content of anti-type II collagen (CII) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, induced Th1-to-Th2 and Tc1-to-Tc2 shifts, and decreased the percentages of CD4+CD29+ and Th17 T cells. Prophylactic vaccination with pcDNA-CCOL2A1 also downregulated various Th1 cytokines, while upregulating both the Th2-type cytokine interleukin-10 and the Th3-type cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2. Our results indicate that the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 DNA vaccine acts as a highly efficient inducer of specific immunotolerance that could be a promising option for RA treatment in the near future.", "Keywords": ["DNA vaccine", "chicken type II collagen", "immune tolerance", "rheumatoid arthritis", "vaccinated efficacy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Arthritis, Experimental", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Collagen Type II", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "Immunization", "Immunophenotyping", "Inflammation Mediators", "Rats", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "Vaccines, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and National Center for Biomedicine Analysis, Beijing 307 Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

Recently, a novel CRISPR-Cas effector, Cas13a has been reported to specifically knock down mRNA expression under the guidance of a single CRISPR-RNA in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas13a system can be engineered for targeted therapy of mutant KRAS in pancreatic cancer. In initial screening, we show that the bacterial Cas13a protein and crRNA significantly knock down mutant KRAS mRNA expression, identifying a CRISPR-Cas13a system that can induce up to a 94% knockdown efficiency. Introducing a single mismatch into the crRNA-target duplex enabled the CRISPR-Cas13a system to specifically recognize KRAS-G12D mRNA with no detectable effects on wild-type KRAS mRNA. More importantly, CRISPR-Cas13a-mediated KRAS-G12D mRNA knockdown potently induced apoptosis in vitro and elicited marked tumor shrinkage in mice.

However, the therapeutic effect of NgBR blockade on tumor vasculature and malignancy is unknown, investigations on which requires an adequate delivery system for small interfering RNA against NgBR (NgBR siRNA). Here a surface charge switchable polymeric nanoparticle that was sensitive to the slightly acidic tumor microenvironment was developed for steady delivery of NgBR siRNA to tumor tissues. The nanoformulation was constructed by conjugating 2, 3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMMA) molecules to the surface amines of micelles formed by cationic co-polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)2-poly(ethylenimine) and subsequent absorption of NgBR siRNAs. The nanoparticles remained negatively charged in physiological condition and smartly converted to positive surface charge due to tumor-acidity-activated shedding of DMMA. The charge conversion facilitated cellular uptake of siRNAs and in turn efficiently depleted the expression of NgBR in tumor-bearing tissues. Silencing of NgBR suppressed endothelial cell migration and tubule formation, and reverted the EMT process of breast cancer cells. Delivery of the nanoformulation to mice bearing orthotopic breast carcinoma showed no effect on tumor growth, but led to remarkable decrease of distant metastasis by normalizing tumor vessels and suppressing the EMT of breast cancer cells.

Herein, a therapeutic peptide assembling nanoparticle that can sequentially respond to dual stimuli in the tumor extracellular matrix was designed for tumor-targeted delivery and on-demand release of a short d-peptide antagonist of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (DPPA-1) and an inhibitor of idoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (NLG919). By concurrent blockade of immune checkpoints and tryptophan metabolism, the nanoformulation increased the level of tumor-infiltrated cytotoxic T cells and in turn effectively inhibited melanoma growth. To achieve this, an amphiphilic peptide, consisting of a functional 3-diethylaminopropyl isothiocyanate (DEAP) molecule, a peptide substrate of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and DPPA-1, was synthesized and coassembled with NLG919. The nanostructure swelled when it encountered the weakly acidic tumor niche where DEAP molecules were protonated, and further collapsed due to the cleavage of the peptide substrate by MMP-2 that is highly expressed in tumor stroma. The localized release of DPPA-1 and NLG919 created an environment which favored the survival and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, leading to the slowdown of melanoma growth and increase of overall survival.

The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate changes in carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) and explore the association of cardiovascular risk factors and the carotid intima thickness in adults with hypertension using standardized methods. We used data from a subgroup of Beijing Vascular Disease Patients Evaluation Study (BEST), a population-based study of community-dwelling adults. The c-IMT, biomarkers, and carotid-femoral-pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline, and lifestyles such as smoking status, sleeping habits, and oil or salt intake level were determined with the use of a validated questionnaire in the follow-up. We reevaluated c-IMT in all the initial 1284 (540 female and 744 male) patients with hypertension after 4 years. At reevaluation, mean (\u00b1 SD) age was 66 \u00b1 1.2 years, systolic blood pressure was 138 \u00b1 19 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure was 91 \u00b1 10 mmHg. The results showed that mean c-IMT z-scores increased significantly during 4 years (0.002 \u00b1 0.003, p < 0.001) as well as carotid-femoral PWV (13.99 \u00b1 2.74, p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (6.97 \u00b1 1.08, p < 0.001). Linear regression showed statistically significant associations between systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, lip-line, and heart rate with c-IMT z-scores of >1.5SD in the fully adjusted models and the p values were 0.000, 0.000, 0.017, 0.001, and 0.044, respectively . There were significant predictors for the mean effect on c-IMT z-score. In a full-model logistic regression, significant risk factors for an increase in IMT of \u22651.5 z-scores were carotid-femoral PWV (odds ratio: 1.119, confidence interval: 1.018, 1.230, p = 0.020 < 0.05) at first measurement. The conclusion of the study was that longitudinal c-IMT measurements revealed progression in subclinical atherosclerosis during a four-year period in a hypertensive old-aged cohort. Systolic or diastolic blood pressure, homocysteine, carotid-femoral PWV, and waistline were significantly related to c-IMT increment. By lifestyle and medical intervention to control these risk factors may prevent progression of c-IMT in old-aged cohort with hypertension. Clinical trial registration: Clinical trials. Gov.

We constructed pC- and pN-procollagen (without N- or C-propeptides, respectively) as well as CTEs located in the triple helical domain lacking both propeptides and telopeptides, and expressed these in yeast Pichia pastoris host strain GS115 (his4, Mut+) simultaneously with recombinant chicken prolyl-4-hydroxylase \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Both pC- and pN-procollagen monomers accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, whereas CTE was assembled into homotrimers with stable conformation and secreted into the supernatants, suggesting that the large molecular weight pC-or pN-procollagens were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the smaller CTEs proceeded through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, resulting recombinant chicken type II collagen pC\u03b11(II) can induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which seems to be as effective as the current standard nCCII.

To solve these problems, we employed a nanomedicine-based formulation of cationic liposomes for co-delivery of GEM along with siRNA targeting RRM2. Due to the specific endocytic uptake mechanism of nanocarriers and gene-silencing effect of RRM2 siRNA, this nanomedicine formulation significantly increased GEM chemosensitivity in tumor models of genetically engineered Panc1 cells with low hENT1 or high RRM2 expression.

Yet, few field data are available on the long-term fate and persistency of sediment-retained oil. While an unprecedented amount of oil dispersants was applied, the effects of oil dispersants on desorption of field aged oil remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the abundance, distributions and physico-chemical availability of the oil retained in Bay Jimmy sediment, Louisiana, five years after the DwH oil spill, and to determine the effects of two model oil dispersants on the desorption potential of the residual oil. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediment were analyzed and compared with those in the crude oil and the pre-DwH levels, and batch desorption kinetic tests were carried out to quantify the dispersant effects on the desorption rate and extent. The biomarker hopanes profile and diagnostic ratio were analyzed, which confirmed the origin and persistence of the sediment-retained oil. After five-year natural weathering, the oil level in the sediment remained orders of magnitude higher than the pre-spill level. Nearly all low-molecular-weight n-alkanes and 2-ring PAHs had been degraded. Oil dispersants, SPC 1000 and Corexit EC9500A, were able to enhance solubilization of the sediment-retained oil upon resuspension of the sediment. Successive desorption experiments indicated that 71.6% of TPHs, 74.8% of n-alkanes, and 91.9% of PAHs in the sediment remained highly stable and hardly desorbable by seawater; yet, addition of 18mg/L of SPC 1000 enhanced the desorption and lowered these fractions to 57.3%, 68.1%, and 81.4%, respectively.

In this study, we developed a TiO2 decorated titanate nanotubes composite (TiO2/TNTs) and used for photocatalytic degradation of BPA. TEM and XRD analysis show that the TiO2/TNTs is a nano-composite of anatase and titanate, with anatase acting as the primary photocatalytic site and titanate as the skeleton. TiO2/TNTs exhibited excellent photocatalytic reactivity and its easy-settling property leaded to good reusability. After 5 reuse cycles, TiO2/TNTs also could photo-degrade 91.2% of BPA with a high rate constant (k1) of 0.039 min-1, which was much better than TiO2 and TNTs. Higher pH facilitated photocatalysis due to more reactive oxygen species produced and less material aggregation. The presence of NaCl and CaCl2 showed negligible effects on BPA degradation, but NaHCO3 caused an inhibition effect resulting from consumption of \u00b7OH. Humic acid inhibited degradation mainly due to blockage of the active sites of TiO2/TNTs. Degradation pathway was well interpreted through theoretical calculation. Hydroxyl radical played the dominate role in BPA photodegradation, and the atoms of BPA with high Fukui index based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculation are the radical easy-attacking (f0) sites. Considering the good photocatalytic reactivity, reusability, stability and settle property, TiO2/TNTs promises to be an efficient alternative for removal of organic compounds from wastewaters.", "Keywords": ["Bisphenol A", "DFT calculation", "Easy-setting", "Photocatalysis", "TiO(2)", "Titanate nanotubes"], "MeSH terms": ["Benzhydryl Compounds", "Endocrine Disruptors", "Models, Chemical", "Nanotubes", "Phenols", "Photolysis", "Titanium", "Water", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, The Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, 100871, China; Center for Agricultural Water Research in China, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Penghui", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhengqing", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, The Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, 100871, China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, PR China.

Muscle is emerging as a key mediator of this homeostatic control through consumption of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, as well as governing systemic signaling networks. However, it remains less clear how energy substrate usage tissues, such as muscle, communicate with energy substrate storage tissues in order to adapt with diurnal changes in energy supply and demand. Using Drosophila, we show here that muscle plays a crucial physiological role in promoting systemic synthesis and accumulation of lipids in fat storage tissues, which subsequently impacts diurnal changes in circulating lipid levels. Our data reveal that the metabolic transcription factor Foxo governs expression of the cytokine unpaired 2 (Upd2) in skeletal muscle, which acts as a myokine to control glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) secretion from specialized neuroendocrine cells.

Whereas KRAS itself has proven difficult to inhibit, agents that target key downstream signals of KRAS, such as RAF, are possibly effective for pancreatic cancer treatment. Because selective BRAF inhibitors paradoxically induce downstream signaling activation, a pan-RAF inhibitor, LY3009120 is a better alternate for KRAS-mutant tumor treatment. Here we explored a new combinational strategy using a YAP inhibitor and LY3009120 in pancreatic cancer treatment. We found that reduced YAP expression closely correlates with longer relapse-free and overall survival of patients. Stable knockdown of YAP significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition, LY3009120 exhibited a dramatically enhanced antitumor effect in combination with YAP knockdown. YAP depletion blocks the activation of a parallel AKT signal pathway after LY3009120 treatment. Finally, combination with a YAP inhibitor, verteporfin, significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of LY3009120.

Cellular responses to estrogens are mediated by estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR1) and estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ESR2). In mouse and rat models, disruption of Esr1 causes infertility in both males and females. However, the role of ESR2 in reproductive function remains undecided because of a wide variation in phenotypic observations among Esr2-mutant mouse strains. Regulatory pathways independent of ESR2 binding to its cognate DNA response element have also been implicated in ESR2 signaling. To clarify the regulatory roles of ESR2, we generated two mutant rat models: one with a null mutation (exon 3 deletion, Esr2\u0394E3) and the other with an inframe deletion selectively disrupting the DNA binding domain (exon 4 deletion, Esr2\u0394E4). In both models, we observed that ESR2-mutant males were fertile. ESR2-mutant females exhibited regular estrous cycles and could be inseminated by wild-type (WT) males but did not become pregnant or pseudopregnant. Esr2-mutant ovaries were small and differed from WT ovaries by their absence of corpora lutea, despite the presence of follicles at various stages of development. Esr2\u0394E3- and Esr2\u0394E4-mutant females exhibited attenuated preovulatory gonadotropin surges and did not ovulate in response to a gonadotropin regimen effective in WT rats. Similarities of reproductive deficits in Esr2\u0394E3 and Esr2\u0394E4 mutants suggest that DNA binding-dependent transcriptional function of ESR2 is critical for preovulatory follicle maturation and ovulation.

Between the two stabilizers, CMC was more effective in resisting particle deposition, and thus CMC-stabilized MWNTs were more transportable through the medium. While non-stabilized MWNTs were much less transportable and were vulnerable to electrolyte effects (especially Ca2+), the stabilized counterparts were much more resistant to the coagulation effects of electrolytes. The presence of colloidal clay particles showed contrasting effects on the transport of bare and stabilized MWNTs. The full breakthrough C/C0 of bare MWNTs was suppressed by kaolinite and montmorillonite particles from 0.33 to <0.15 with 5mg/L clay, indicating that the presence of both clays enhanced the aggregation and deposition of MWNTs. However, kaolinite particles facilitated the transport of stabilized-MWNTs, while montmorillonite weakened the breakthrough of stabilized MWNTs. Humic acid had less effect on the mobility of stabilized-MWNTs than that of bare MWNTs. The advection-dispersion transport model incorporated with the filtration theory was able to simulate the breakthrough curves and quantitatively interpret the particle deposition.

In total, 85 cases of middle and late period NSCLC patients were selected, and were randomly divided into the RFA combined chemotherapy group, RFA treatment group and chemotherapy group. After treatment, the three groups were followed up for computed tomography (CT) scan, and were analyzed for the effect of RFA combined chemotherapy on middle and late period NSCLC. It was found that CT value of RFA combined chemotherapy group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P<0.05). The CT value of the RFA group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P<0.05). The CT value of chemotherapy group was not significantly changed compared to before surgery (P>0.05). The postoperative CT value of the RFA combined chemotherapy group and RFA group was smaller compared to that of the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). Effective rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly higher than that of the EFA and chemotherapy groups (P<0.05). Effective rate (CR+PR) of the RFA group was significantly higher than that of the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). By contrast, the progressive rate (P) of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly lower than that of the RFA and chemotherapy groups (P<0.05).

SESR makes it economically feasible to use a wide range of feedstocks for hydrogen production such as methane, ethanol, and biomass. Selection of catalysts and sorbents plays a vital role in SESR. This article reviews the recent research aimed at process intensification by the integration of catalysis and chemisorption functions into a single material. Alkali metal ceramic powders, including Li2ZrO3, Li4SiO4 and Na2ZrO3 display characteristics suitable for capturing CO2 at low concentrations (<15% CO2) and high temperatures (>500 \u00b0C), and thus are applicable to precombustion technologies such as SESR, as well as postcombustion capture of CO2 from flue gases. This paper reviews the progress made in improving the operational performance of alkali metal ceramics under conditions that simulate power plant and SESR operation, by adopting new methods of sorbent synthesis and doping with additional elements.

TNTs@AC was prepared through a one-step hydrothermal method, and is composed of an activated charcoal core and a shell of carbon-coated titanate nanotubes. TNTs@AC offered a maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of 12.1 mg/g for phenanthrene (a model PAH), which is \u223c11 times higher than the parent activated charcoal. Phenanthrene was rapidly concentrated onto TNTs@AC, and subsequently completely photodegraded under UV light within 2 h. The photoregenerated TNTs@AC can then be reused for another adsorption-photodegradation cycle without significant capacity or activity loss. TNTs@AC performed well over a wide range of pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter. Mechanistically, the enhanced adsorption capacity is attributed to the formation of carbon-coated ink-bottle pores of the titanate nanotubes, which are conducive to capillary condensation; in addition, the modified microcarbon facilitates transfer of excited electrons, thereby inhibiting recombination of the electron-hole pairs, resulting in high photocatalytic activity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 90 patients (age range, 18-65 years) who underwent general anesthesia were selected and divided into supine position (SP group) and lithotomy position groups (LP group). Vital signs and respiratory dynamic parameters of the 2 groups were measured at different time points and after implantation of an LMA. The arterial blood gas was monitored at 15 min after induction. The intraoperative changes of hemodynamic indexes and postoperative adverse reactions of LMA were recorded. The possible correlation between body mass index (BMI) and respiratory dynamic indexes was analyzed. RESULTS With prolonged duration of the operation, the inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat), inspiratory resistance (RI), and work of breathing (WOB) gradually increased, while chest-lung compliance (Compl) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in end-expiratory gas (PetCO2) gradually decreased (all P value <0.05). The mean airway pressure (Pmean), Pplat, and expiratory resistance (Re) in the LP group were significantly higher than in the SP group (P<0.05), while the peak inspiratory flow (FImax), peak expiratory flow (FEmax), WOB, and Compl in the LP group were significantly lower than in the SP group (P<0.05).

Hypothesizing that nanomedicines may impact ICD due to their proven advantages in delivery of chemotherapeutics, we encapsulated oxaliplatin (OXA) or gemcitabine (GEM), an ICD and a non-ICD inducer respectively, into the amphiphilic diblock copolymer nanoparticles. Neither GEM nor nanoparticle-encapsulated GEM (NP-GEM) induced ICD, while both OXA and nanoparticle-encapsulated OXA (NP-OXA) induced ICD. Interestingly, NP-OXA treated tumor cells released more DAMPs and induced stronger immune responses of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes than OXA treatment in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, OXA and NP-OXA exhibited stronger therapeutic effects in immunocompetent mice than in immunodeficient mice, and the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy was significantly higher in the NP-OXA group than the OXA group. Moreover, NP-OXA treatment induced a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes than OXA treatment. This general trend of enhanced ICD by nanoparticle delivery was corroborated in evaluating another pair of ICD inducer and non-ICD inducer, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. In conclusion, although nanoparticle encapsulation did not endow a non-ICD inducer with ICD-mediated anti-tumor capacity, treatment with a nanoparticle-encapsulated ICD inducer led to significantly enhanced ICD and consequently improved anti-tumor effects than the free ICD inducer.

To better understand its mechanism of toxicity, we performed transcriptional profiling of liver cells isolated from zebrafish larvae at the earliest stage of biliatresone-mediated biliary injury, with subsequent comparison of biliary and hepatocyte gene expression profiles. Transcripts encoded by genes involved in redox stress response, particularly those involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism, were among the most prominently up-regulated in both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes of biliatresone-treated larvae. Consistent with these findings, hepatic GSH was depleted at the onset of biliary injury, and in situ mapping of the hepatic GSH redox potential using a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein biosensor showed that it was significantly more oxidized in EHCs both before and after treatment with biliatresone. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of GSH redox homeostasis confirmed the importance of GSH in modulating biliatresone-induced injury given that GSH depletion sensitized both EHCs and the otherwise resistant intrahepatic cholangiocytes to the toxin, whereas replenishing GSH level by N-acetylcysteine administration or activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional regulator of GSH synthesis, inhibited EHC injury.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcysteine", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Benzodioxoles", "Biliary Atresia", "Disease Models, Animal", "Glutathione", "Hepatocytes", "Isothiocyanates", "Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1", "Liver", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Sulfoxides", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Lorent", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Wilkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Dylan M", "Last Name": "Marchione", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Gillespie", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Orith", "Last Name": "Waisbourd-Zinman", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Juhoon", "Last Name": "So", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Kyung Ah", "Last Name": "Koo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Donghun", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca G", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Blair", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Pack", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}], "Journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "PubDate": "2016Sep"}, {"PMID": "27083527", "Title": "Dissociated neural substrates underlying impulsive choice and impulsive action.", "Abstract": "There is a growing consensus that impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that comprises several components such as impulsive choice and impulsive action. Although impulsive choice and impulsive action have been shown to be the common characteristics of some impulsivity-related psychiatric disorders, surprisingly few studies have directly compared their neural correlates and addressed the question whether they involve common or distinct neural correlates. We addressed this important empirical gap using an individual differences approach that could characterize the functional relevance of neural networks in behaviors. A large sample (n=227) of college students was tested with the delay discounting and stop-signal tasks, and their performances were correlated with the neuroanatomical (gray matter volume, GMV) and functional (resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC) measures, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and 10-fold cross-validation. Behavioral results showed no significant correlation between impulsive choice measured by discounting rate (k) and impulsive action measured by stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The GMVs in the right frontal pole (FP) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) were predictive of k, but not SSRT. In contrast, the GMVs in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), supplementary motor area (SMA), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) could predict individuals' SSRT, but not k. RSFC analysis using the FP and right IFG as seed regions revealed two distinct networks that correspond well to the \"waiting\" and \"stopping\" systems, respectively. Furthermore, the RSFC between the FP and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) was predictive of k, whereas the RSFC between the IFG and pre-SMA was predictive of SSRT.

We treated mouse cholangiocytes in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture and neonatal extrahepatic duct explants with biliatresone and compounds that regulate glutathione (GSH). We examined the effects of biliatresone on SOX17 levels and determined the effects of Sox17 knockdown on cholangiocytes in 3D culture. We found that biliatresone caused disruption of cholangiocyte apical polarity and loss of monolayer integrity. Spheroids treated with biliatresone had increased permeability as shown by rhodamine efflux within 5 hours compared with untreated spheroids, which retained rhodamine for longer than 12 hours. Neonatal bile duct explants treated with the toxin showed lumen obstruction with increased subepithelial staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and collagen, consistent with fibrosis. Biliatresone caused a rapid and transient decrease in GSH, which was both necessary and sufficient to mediate its effects in cholangiocyte spheroid and bile duct explant systems.

However, the patients receiving amifostine suffer from severe dose-dependent adverse effects. Strategies for improvement of the protective efficacy and toxicity profile of amifostine are urgently required. Here we constructed a PEGylated amifostine (PEG-amifostine) through conjugation of amifostine to the 4-arm PEG (5000 Da) by a mild one-step reaction. The relatively large PEG-amifostine molecules clustered into spherical nanoparticles, resulting in distinct hydrolysis properties, cell uptake profile and antioxidative activity compared with the free small molecules. PEGylation prolonged the hydrolysis time of amifostine, providing sustained transformation to its functional metabolites. PEG-amifostine could be internalized into cells and translocated to acidic organelles in a time-dependent manner. The intrinsic cytotoxicity of amifostine, which is related to the reductive reactivity of its metabolites and their ability to diffuse readily, was attenuated after PEGylation. This modification impeded the interaction between free sulfhydryls and functional biomolecules, providing PEG-amifostine with an improved safety profile in vitro.

Monocytes, the precursors of TAMs, normally undergo spontaneous apoptosis within 2 days, but can subsist in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment for continuous survival and generation of sufficient TAMs. The mechanisms underlying tumor-driving monocyte survival remain obscure. Here we report that cancer cell-derived exosomes were crucial mediators for monocyte survival in the inflammatory niche. Analysis of the survival-promoting molecules in monocytes revealed that cancer cell-derived exosomes activated Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in the prevention of caspase cleavage. Phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), were abundantly expressed in cancer cell-derived exosomes. Knock-out of EGFR or/and HER-2, or alternatively, inhibitors against their phosphorylation significantly disturbed the exosome-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway, inhibition of caspase cleavage, and increase in survival rate in monocytes. Moreover, the deprived survival-stimulating activity of exosomes due to null expression of EGFR and HER-2 could be restored by activation of another RTK, insulin receptor. Overall, our study uncovered a mechanism of tumor-associated monocyte survival and demonstrated that cancer cell-derived exosomes can stimulate the MAPK pathway in monocytes through transport of functional RTKs, leading to inactivation of apoptosis-related caspases. This work provides insights into the long sought question on monocyte survival prior to formation of plentiful TAMs in the tumor microenvironment.", "Keywords": ["caspase", "exosome (vesicle)", "mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)", "monocyte", "receptor tyrosine kinase", "survival", "tumor microenvironment"], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "Caspases", "Cell Survival", "ErbB Receptors", "Exosomes", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Monocytes", "Neoplasms", "Receptor, ErbB-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanping", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China, the College of Pharmaceutical Science, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruifang", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Yinlong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China, the College of Pharmaceutical Science, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China, the Department of Pancreatic Carcinoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China, and."}, {"First Name": "Gregory J", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "the Iron Metabolism Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Locked Bag 2000, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland 4029, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Guangjun", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "From the CAS Key Laboratory of Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety & CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11th Beiyitiao, Zhongguancun, Beijing 100190, China, niegj@nanoctr.cn."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2016Apr15"}, {"PMID": "26895857", "Title": "Enhancement of D-lactic acid production from a mixed glucose and xylose substrate by the Escherichia coli strain JH15 devoid of the glucose effect.", "Abstract": "A thermal tolerant stereo-complex poly-lactic acid (SC-PLA) can be made by mixing Poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA) and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) at a defined ratio.
