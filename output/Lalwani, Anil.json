[{"PMID": "38928621", "Title": "Exploring Inner Ear and Brain Connectivity through Perilymph Sampling for Early Detection of Neurological Diseases: A Provocative Proposal.", "Abstract": "Recent evidence shows that it is possible to identify the elements responsible for sensorineural hearing loss, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, by performing perilymph sampling. However, current studies have only focused on the diagnosis of such as otologic conditions. Hearing loss is a feature of certain neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is widely detected in Alzheimer's disease. Although the environment of the inner ear is highly regulated, there are several communication pathways between the perilymph of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, examination of the perilymph may help understand the mechanism behind the hearing loss observed in certain neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review the constituents of CSF and perilymph, the anatomy of the inner ear and its connection with the brain. Then, we discuss the relevance of perilymph sampling in neurology. Currently, perilymph sampling is only performed during surgical procedures, but we hypothesize a simplified and low-invasive technique that could allow sampling in a clinical setting with the same ease as performing an intratympanic injection under direct visual check. The use of this modified technique could allow for perilymph sampling in people with hearing loss and neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders and clarify the relationship between these conditions; in fact, by measuring the concentration of neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers and those typically expressed in the inner ear in aging SNHL, it could be possible to understand if SNHL is caused by aging or neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": ["CSF", "brain", "neurodegeneration", "neuroinflammation", "perilymph"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arianna", "Last Name": "Di Stadio", "Affiliation": "Department GF Ingrassia, University of Catania, 95131 Catania, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Ralli", "Affiliation": "Organ of Sense Department, University La Sapienza, 00185 Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Diego", "Last Name": "Kaski", "Affiliation": "Sense Research Unit, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nehzat", "Last Name": "Koohi", "Affiliation": "Sense Research Unit, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Federico Maria", "Last Name": "Gioacchini", "Affiliation": "Ear, Nose, and Throat Unit, Department of Clinical and Molecular Sciences, Polytechnic University of Marche, 60020 Ancona, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey W", "Last Name": "Kysar", "Affiliation": "Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Department, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Lalwani", "Affiliation": "Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Department, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Athanasia", "Last Name": "Warnecke", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Evanthia", "Last Name": "Bernitsas", "Affiliation": "Multiple Sclerosis Center, Neurology Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jun20"}, {"PMID": "38487773", "Title": "Instrumented insoles for assessment of gait in patients with vestibular schwannoma.", "Abstract": "Imbalance and gait disturbances are common in patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) and can result in significant morbidity.

Although aiming for homogeneity of symptoms, this method often results in highly heterogeneous disorders. A standing question thus is how to automatically stratify a given random cohort of the population, such that treatment can be better tailored to each cluster's symptoms, and severity of any given group forecasted to provide neuroprotective therapies. In this work we introduce new methods to automatically stratify a random cohort of the population composed of healthy controls of different ages and patients with different disorders of the nervous systems. Using a simple walking task and measuring micro-fluctuations in their biorhythmic motions, we combine non-linear causal network connectivity analyses in the temporal and frequency domains with stochastic mapping.

As the only non-osseous barrier between these two spaces, the RWM is an ideal candidate for aspiration of perilymph for diagnostics purposes and delivery of medication for treatment of inner ear disorders. Routine access across the RWM requires the development of new surgical tools whose design can only be optimized with a thorough understanding of the RWM's structure and properties. The RWM possesses a layer of collagen and elastic fibers so characterization of the distribution and orientation of these fibers is essential. Confocal and two-photon microscopy were conducted on intact RWMs in a guinea pig model to characterize the distribution of collagen and elastic fibers. The fibers were imaged via second-harmonic-generation, autofluorescence, and Rhodamine B staining. Quantitative analyses of both fiber orientation and geometrical properties of the RWM uncovered a significant correlation between mean fiber orientations and directions of zero curvature in some portions of the RWM, with an even more significant correlation between the mean fiber orientations and linear distance along the RWM in a direction approximately parallel to the cochlear axis. The measured mean fiber directions and dispersions can be incorporated into a generalized structure tensor for use in the development of continuum anisotropic mechanical constitutive models that in turn will enable optimization of surgical tools to access the cochlea. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The Round Window Membrane (RWM) is the only non-osseous barrier separating the middle and inner ear spaces, and thus is an ideal portal for medical access to the cochlea. An understanding of RWM structure and mechanical response is necessary to optimize the design of surgical tools for this purpose. The RWM geometry and the connective fiber orientation and dispersion are measured via confocal and 2-photon microscopy. A region of the RWM geometry is characterized as a hyperbolic paraboloid and another region as a tapered parabolic cylinder. Predominant fiber directions correlate well with directions of zero curvature in the hyperbolic paraboloid region. Overall fiber directions correlate well with position along a line approximately parallel to the central axis of the cochlea's spiral.", "Keywords": ["Collagen fibers", "Confocal microscopy", "Elastic fibers", "Hyperbolic paraboloid", "Round window membrane"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cochlea", "Guinea Pigs", "Membranes", "Perilymph", "Round Window, Ear"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Arriaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel N", "Last Name": "Arteaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dimitrios", "Last Name": "Fafalis", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen E", "Last Name": "Kasza", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Lalwani", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey W", "Last Name": "Kysar", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The recent development of hollow microneedles enables safe and reliable sampling of perilymph for proteomic analysis. Using these microneedles, we investigate the effect of intratympanic (IT) versus intraperitoneal (IP) dexamethasone administration on guinea pig perilymph proteome. Guinea pigs were treated with IT dexamethasone (n = 6), IP dexamethasone (n = 8), or untreated for control (n = 8) 6 h prior to aspiration. The round window membrane (RWM) was accessed via a postauricular approach, and hollow microneedles were used to perforate the RWM and aspirate 1 \u03bcL of perilymph. Perilymph samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics. Mass spectrometry raw data files have been deposited in an international public repository (MassIVE proteomics repository at https://massive.ucsd.edu/) under data set # MSV000086887. In the 22 samples of perilymph analyzed, 632 proteins were detected, including the inner ear protein cochlin, a perilymph marker. Of these, 14 proteins were modulated by IP, and three proteins were modulated by IT dexamethasone. In both IP and IT dexamethasone groups, VGF nerve growth factor inducible was significantly upregulated compared to control. The remaining adjusted proteins modulate neurons, inflammation, or protein synthesis. Proteome analysis facilitated by the use of hollow microneedles shows that route of dexamethasone administration impacts changes seen in perilymph proteome. Compared to IT administration, the IP route was associated with greater changes in protein expression, including proteins involved in neuroprotection, inflammatory pathway, and protein synthesis.

Timely tracheostomy, when indicated, may shorten the course of intensive care unit stay and thereby potentially reduce the impairments associated with PICS. Otolaryngologists can provide expertise in olfactory disorders; thrombotic sequelae of hearing loss and vertigo; and laryngotracheal injuries that impair speech, voice, swallowing, communication, and breathing. In the aftermath of severe COVID-19, otolaryngologists are poised to lead efforts in early identification and intervention for impairments affecting patients' quality of life.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Critical care", "Dizziness", "Gustatory", "Head and neck cancer", "Hearing loss", "Iatrogenic injury", "Intensive care unit", "Laryngotracheal injury, Subglottic stenosis, Tracheal stenosis", "Olfactory", "Pandemic", "Patient safety and quality improvement", "Quality of life", "SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus", "Smell", "Speech", "Swallowing", "Taste", "Tracheocutaneous fistula", "Tracheostomy", "Tracheotomy", "Ventilator"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Otolaryngologists", "Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases", "Quality of Life", "SARS-CoV-2", "Survivorship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vinciya", "Last Name": "Pandian", "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing Faculty, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; Outcomes After Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Research Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.

Twenty old and twelve young subjects walked on an instrumented walkway in real and virtual environments while reacting to antero-posterior and medio-lateral oscillations of the visual field. Mean and variability of spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated during the first and fifth minutes of walking. A 3-way mixed-design ANOVA was performed to determine the main and interaction effects of group, condition and time. Both groups modified gait similarly, but older adults walked with shorter and slower strides and did not reduce stride velocity or increase stride width variability during medio-lateral perturbations. This may be related to a more conservative and anticipatory strategy as well as a reduced perception of the optic flow. Over time, participants adapted similarly to the perturbations but only younger participants reduced their stride velocity variability.

The round window membrane (RWM) is the only delivery portal from the middle ear to the inner ear that does not require perforation of bone. Recent advances in microneedle fabrication enable the RWM to be perforated safely with polymeric microneedles as a means to enhance the rate of drug delivery from the middle ear to the inner ear. However, the polymeric material is not biocompatible and also lacks the strength of other materials. Herein we describe the design and development of gold-coated metallic microneedles suitable for RWM perforation. When developing microneedle technology for drug delivery, we considered three important general attributes: (1) high strength and ductility material, (2) high accuracy and precision of fabrication, and (3) broad design freedom. We developed a hybrid additive manufacturing method using two-photon lithography and electrochemical deposition to fabricate ultra-sharp gold-coated copper microneedles with these attributes. We refer to the microneedle fabrication methodology as two-photon templated electrodeposition (2PTE). We demonstrate the use of these microneedles by inducing a perforation with a minimal degree of trauma in a guinea pig RWM while the microneedle itself remains undamaged. Thus, this microneedle has the potential literally of opening the RWM for enhanced drug delivery into the inner ear. Finally, the 2PTE methodology can be applied to many different classes of microneedles for other drug delivery purposes as well the fabrication of small scale structures and devices for non-medical applications.

One of these portals is the round window, which is covered by the Round Window Membrane (RWM). A longstanding clinical goal is to reliably and precisely deliver therapeutics into the cochlea to treat a plethora of auditory and vestibular disorders. Standard of care for several difficult-to-treat diseases calls for injection of a therapeutic substance through the tympanic membrane into the middle ear space, after which a portion of the substance diffuses across the RWM into the cochlea. The efficacy of this technique is limited by an inconsistent rate of molecular transport across the RWM. A solution to this problem involves the introduction of one or more microscopic perforations through the RWM to enhance the rate and reliability of diffusive transport. This paper reports the use of direct 3D printing via Two-Photon Polymerization (2PP) lithography to fabricate ultra-sharp polymer microneedles specifically designed to perforate the RWM. The microneedle has tip radius of 500 nm and shank radius of 50 \u03bc m, and perforates the guinea pig RWM with a mean force of 1.19 mN. The resulting perforations performed in vitro are lens-shaped with major axis equal to the microneedle shank diameter and minor axis about 25% of the major axis, with mean area 1670 \u03bc m2. The major axis is aligned with the direction of the connective fibers within the RWM. The fibers were separated along their axes without ripping or tearing of the RWM suggesting the main failure mechanism to be fiber-to-fiber decohesion. The small perforation area along with fiber-to-fiber decohesion are promising indicators that the perforations would heal readily following in vivo experiments. These results establish a foundation for the use of Two-Photon Polymerization lithography as a means to fabricate microneedles to perforate the RWM and other similar membranes.", "Keywords": ["3-D laser printing", "Inner ear delivery", "Microneedles", "Nanoscribe", "Round window membrane"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biological Transport", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Equipment Design", "Guinea Pigs", "Needles", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Round Window, Ear"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aykut", "Last Name": "Aksit", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel N", "Last Name": "Arteaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology - Head, Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Arriaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hirobumi", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen E", "Last Name": "Kasza", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Lalwani", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey W", "Last Name": "Kysar", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA. jk2079@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "PubDate": "2018Jun08"}, {"PMID": "29519690", "Title": "Music enjoyment with cochlear implantation.", "Abstract": "Since the advent of cochlear implant (CI) surgery in the 1960s, there have been remarkable technological and surgical advances enabling excellent speech perception in quiet with many CI users able to use the telephone.

However, a method to measure brain atrophy associated with hearing loss from a single MRI study (i.e. without an interval study) that produces an independently interpretable output does not. Such a method would be beneficial for studying patterns of structural brain changes on a large scale. Here, we introduce our method for this. Audiometric evaluations and mini-mental state exams were obtained in 34 subjects over the age of 80 who have had brain MRIs in the past 6\u00a0years. CSF and parenchymal brain volumes (whole brain and by lobe) were obtained through a novel, fully automated algorithm. Atrophy was calculated by taking the ratio of CSF to parenchyma. High frequency hearing loss was associated with disproportional temporal lobe atrophy relative to whole brain atrophy independent of age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.471, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Mental state was associated with frontoparietal atrophy but not to temporal lobe atrophy, which is consistent with known results. Our method demonstrates that hearing loss is associated with temporal lobe atrophy and generalized whole brain atrophy.

However, in the absence of a tool designed for creating precise perforation, current practices lead to tearing of the RWM and significant intracochlear pressure fluctuations. On the basis of RWM mechanical properties, we have designed a multi-serrated needle to create consistent holes without membrane tearing or damaging inner ear structures. Four and eight-serrated needles were designed and produced with wire electrical discharge machining (EDM). The needle's ability to create RWM perforations was tested in deidentified, commercially acquired temporal bones with the assistance of a micromanipulator. Subsequently, specimens were imaged under light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The needles created consistent, appropriately sized holes in the membrane with minimal tearing. While a four-serrated crown needle made rectangular/trapezoid perforations, the octagonal crown formed smooth oval holes within the membrane. Though designed for single use, the needle tolerated repeated use without significant damage. The serrated needles formed precise perforations in the RWM while minimizing damage during cochlear implantation. The octagonal needle design created the preferred oval perforation better than the quad needle. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The round window membrane (RWM) is an attractive portal for accessing cochlear fluids as it heals spontaneously. In this study, we report on the development of a microneedle for perilymph sampling that minimizes the size of RWM perforation, facilitates quick aspiration, and provides precise volume control. Here, considering the mechanical anisotropy of the RWM and hydrodynamics through a microneedle, a 31G stainless steel pipe was machined into wedge-shaped design via electrical discharge machining. The sharpness of the needle was evaluated via a surface profilometer. Guinea pig RWM was penetrated in vitro, and 1 \u03bcL of perilymph was sampled and analyzed via UV-vis spectroscopy. The prototype wedge shaped needle was successfully fabricated with the tip curvature of 4.5 \u03bcm and the surface roughness of 3.66 \u03bcm in root mean square. The needle created oval perforation with minor and major diameter of 143 and 344 \u03bcm (n\u2009=\u20096). The sampling duration and standard deviation of aspirated volume were 3 s and 6.8 % respectively. The protein concentration was 1.74 mg/mL. The prototype needle facilitated precise perforation of RWMs and rapid aspiration of cochlear fluid with precise volume control. The needle design is promising and requires testing in human cadaveric temporal bone and further optimization to become clinically viable.", "Keywords": ["Inner ear disease", "Microneedle", "Minimally invasive sampling", "Personalized medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cochlea", "Equipment Design", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Microtechnology", "Needles", "Paracentesis", "Perilymph", "Solutions", "Time Factors", "Tympanic Membrane"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hirobumi", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA. hw2420@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Cardoso", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of The University of New York, New York, NY, 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Lalwani", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey W", "Last Name": "Kysar", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 220 Mudd Building 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "26543322", "Title": "Music Engineering as a Novel Strategy for Enhancing Music Enjoyment in the Cochlear Implant Recipient.", "Abstract": "Enjoyment of music remains an elusive goal following cochlear implantation.
