G6PD is an essential enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), generating NADPH needed for cellular biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, the latter especially key in red blood cells (RBCs). Beyond the RBC, there is emerging evidence that G6PD exerts an immunologic role by virtue of its functions in leukocyte oxidative metabolism and anabolic synthesis necessary for immune effector function.

However, it remains unclear how it causes protracted courses of infection in spite of its expression of immunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide, which should activate a brisk inflammatory response and bacterial clearance. We predicted that the metabolic stress induced by the bacteria in the host cells shapes an immune response that tolerates infection. We combined in situ metabolic imaging and transcriptional analyses to demonstrate that Kp ST258 activates host glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This response creates an oxidant-rich microenvironment conducive to the accumulation of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. In this setting, metabolically active Kp ST258 elicits a disease-tolerant immune response. The bacteria, in turn, adapt to airway oxidants by upregulating the type VI secretion system, which is highly conserved across ST258 strains worldwide. Thus, much of the global success of Kp ST258 in hospital settings can be explained by the metabolic activity provoked in the host that promotes disease tolerance.", "Keywords": ["Klebsiella pneumoniae", "M2 macrophages", "MDSCs", "bacterial adaptation", "disease tolerance", "immunometabolism", "immunosuppression", "itaconate", "pulmonary infection", "type 6 secretion system"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Wong Fok Lung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Lung Inflammation via Host Epithelial Activation.", "Abstract": "Respiratory distress in severe malaria is associated with high mortality, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. The malaria pigment hemozoin (HZ) is abundant in target organs of severe malaria, including the lungs, and is known to be a potent innate immune activator of phagocytes. We hypothesized that HZ might also stimulate lung epithelial activation and thereby potentiate lung inflammation. We show here that airway epithelium stimulated with HZ undergoes global transcriptional reprogramming and changes in cell surface protein expression that comprise an epithelial activation phenotype. Proinflammatory signaling is induced, and key cytoadherence molecules are upregulated, including several associated with severe malaria, such as CD36 and ICAM1. Epithelial and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways are transformed, including induction of key metalloproteases and modulation of epithelial junctions. The overall program induced by HZ serves to promote inflammation and neutrophil transmigration, and is recapitulated in a murine model of HZ-induced acute pneumonitis. Together, our data demonstrate a direct role for hemozoin in stimulating epithelial activation that could potentiate lung inflammation in malaria.IMPORTANCE Respiratory distress (RD) is a complication of severe malaria associated with a particularly high risk for death in African children infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum The pathophysiology underlying RD remains poorly understood, and the condition is managed supportively. The parasite-derived factor HZ accumulates in target organs of severe malaria, including the lungs, and is a potent stimulator of immune cells. Our findings demonstrate that HZ causes global activation of lung epithelial cells, a response that directly promotes lung inflammation. HZ stimulates expression of key proinflammatory and cell surface molecules, alters signaling pathways involved in epithelial-matrix remodeling, and promotes neutrophil transmigration and airway inflammation. The lung epithelial activation induced by HZ mimics patterns seen in malarial lung injury and provides new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of RD.", "Keywords": ["hemozoin", "lung inflammation", "malaria"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bronchi", "CD36 Antigens", "Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Hemeproteins", "Host-Parasite Interactions", "Inflammation", "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1", "Lung", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neutrophils", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shivang S", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA ss5235@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice S", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2021Feb09"}, {"PMID": "33553686", "Title": "P53 regulation of osteoblast differentiation is mediated through specific microRNAs.", "Abstract": "In order to understand the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in microRNA expression during osteoblast differentiation, we used a screen to identify microRNAs that were altered in a p53-dependent manner. MicroRNAs from MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were isolated from day 0 (undifferentiated) and day 4 (differentiating) and compared to a p53 deficient MC3T3-E1 line treated similarly. Overall, one fourth of all the microRNAs tested showed a reduction of 0.6 fold, and a similar number of them were increased 1.7 fold with differentiation. P53 deficiency caused 40% reduction in expression of microRNAs in differentiating cells, while a small percent (0.03%) showed an increase. Changes in microRNAs were validated using real-time PCR and two microRNAs were selected for further analysis (miR-34b and miR-140). These two microRNAs were increased significantly during differentiation but showed a dramatic reduction in expression in a p53 deficient state. Stable expression of miR-34b and miR-140 in MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in decreases in cell proliferation rates when compared to control cells. There was a 4-fold increase in p53 levels with miR-34b expression and a less dramatic increase with miR-140. Putative target binding sites for bone specific transcription factors, Runx2 and Osterix, were found for miR-34b, while Runx2, beta catenin and type 1 collagen were found to be miR-140 targets. Western blot analyses and functional assays for the transcription factors Runx2, Osterix and Beta-catenin confirmed microRNA specific interactions.
