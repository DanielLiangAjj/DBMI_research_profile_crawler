In HIS mice that generate T cells de novo from hematopoietic progenitors, T cell-dependent multisystem autoimmune disease occurs, most rapidly when the human T cells develop in the native NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl (NSG) mouse thymus, where negative selection is abnormal. Disease develops very late when human T cells develop in human fetal thymus grafts, where robust negative selection is observed. We demonstrate here that PD-1 + CD4 + peripheral (Tph) helper-like and follicular (Tfh) helper-like T cells developing in HIS mice can induce autoimmune disease. Tfh-like cells were more prominent in HIS mice with a mouse thymus, in which the highest levels of IgG were detected in plasma, compared to those with a human thymus. While circulating IgG and IgM antibodies were autoreactive to multiple mouse antigens, in vivo depletion of B cells and antibodies did not delay the development of autoimmune disease. Conversely, adoptive transfer of enriched Tfh- or Tph-like cells induced disease and autoimmunity-associated B cell phenotypes in recipient mice containing autologous human APCs without T cells. T cells from mice with a human thymus expanded and induced disease more rapidly than those originating in a murine thymus, implicating HLA-restricted T cell-APC interactions in this process. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies and LIP have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Vecchione", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohsen", "Last Name": "Khosravi-Maharlooei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nichole", "Last Name": "Danzl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao Wei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Nauman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Madley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Waffarn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaolan", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Georgia", "Last Name": "Fousteri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May05"}, {"PMID": "38580539", "Title": "Tolerance in intestinal transplantation.", "Abstract": "Intestinal transplantation (ITx) is highly immunogenic, resulting in the need for high levels of immunosuppression, with frequent complications along with high rejection rates. Tolerance induction would provide a solution to these limitations. Detailed studies of alloreactive T cell clones as well as multiparameter flow cytometry in the graft and peripheral tissues have provided evidence for several tolerance mechanisms that occur spontaneously following ITx, which might provide targets for further interventions. These include the frequent occurrence of macrochimerism and engraftment in the recipient bone marrow of donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells carried in the allograft. These phenomena are seen most frequently in recipients of multivisceral transplants and are associated with reduced rejection rates. They reflect powerful graft-vs-host responses that enter the peripheral lymphoid system and bone marrow after expanding within and emigrating from the allograft. Several mechanisms of tolerance that may result from this lymphohematopoietic graft-vs-host response are discussed. Transcriptional profiling in quiescent allografts reveals tolerization of pre-existing host-vs-graft-reactive T cells that enter the allograft mucosa and become tissue-resident memory cells. Dissection of the pathways driving and maintaining this tolerant tissue-resident state among donor-reactive T cells will allow controlled tolerance induction through specific therapeutic approaches.", "Keywords": ["Graft-vs-host response", "Intestinal transplantation", "Single cell transcriptomics", "T cells", "Tolerance"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Intestines", "Transplantation Tolerance", "Animals", "Graft Rejection", "Graft vs Host Reaction", "Organ Transplantation", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Immune Tolerance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

The outcomes of kidney transplantation are significantly better than for chronic dialysis: kidney transplant recipients have lower rates of mortality and cardiovascular events and better quality of life, but wait-list time matters. Time on dialysis waiting for a deceased-donor kidney is a strong independent risk factor for outcomes after a kidney transplant.

Here, through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that Pip4k2c loss conferred LM but had no impact on lung metastasis or primary tumor growth. Pip4k2c-deficient cells were hypersensitized to insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and exploited the insulin-rich liver milieu for organ-specific metastasis. We observed concordant changes in PIP4K2C expression and distinct metabolic changes in 3,511 patient melanomas, including primary tumors, LMs and lung metastases. We found that systemic PI3K inhibition exacerbated LM burden in mice injected with Pip4k2c-deficient cancer cells through host-mediated increase in hepatic insulin levels; however, this circuit could be broken by concurrent administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor or feeding of a ketogenic diet. Thus, this work demonstrates a rare example of metastatic organotropism through co-optation of physiological metabolic cues and proposes therapeutic avenues to counteract these mechanisms.",

Following intestinal transplantation (ITx), surveillance ileal mucosal biopsies provide a unique opportunity to map the dynamic establishment of gut lymphocyte populations. Using polychromatic flow cytometry that includes HLA allele group-specific mAbs distinguishing donor from recipient cells along with high throughput BCR sequencing, we tracked the establishment of recipient B cell populations and BCR repertoire in the allograft mucosa of ITx recipients. We confirm the early presence of na\u00efve donor B cells in the circulation and, for the first time, document the establishment of recipient B cell populations, including B resident memory cells, in the intestinal allograft mucosa. Recipient B cell repopulation of the allograft was most rapid in infant (<1 year old)-derived allografts and, unlike T cell repopulation, did not correlate with rejection rates. While recipient memory B cell populations were increased in graft mucosa compared to circulation, na\u00efve recipient B cells remained detectable in the graft mucosa for years. Comparisons of peripheral and intra-mucosal B cell repertoires in the absence of rejection revealed increased BCR mutation rates and clonal expansion in graft mucosa compared to circulating B cells, but these parameters did not increase markedly after the first year post-transplant. Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults. Collectively, our data demonstrate intestinal mucosal B cell repertoire establishment from a circulating pool, a process that continues for years without evidence of establishment of a stable mucosal

SARS-CoV2 and common human coronaviruses.", "Abstract": "T cell immunity plays a central role in clinical outcomes of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and T cell-focused vaccination or cellular immunotherapy might provide enhanced protection for some immunocompromised patients. Pre-existing T cell memory recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens antedating COVID-19 infection or vaccination, may have developed as an imprint of prior infections with endemic non-SARS human coronaviruses (hCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, pathogens of \"common cold\". In turn, SARS-CoV-2-primed T cells may recognize emerging variants or other hCoV viruses and modulate the course of subsequent hCoV infections. Cross-immunity between hCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated T cell responses against the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and corresponding antigens from \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs among vaccinated, convalescent, and unexposed subjects. Broad T cell immunity against all tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens emerged in COVID-19 survivors. In convalescent and in vaccinated individuals, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells reliably recognized most SARS-CoV-2 variants, however cross-reactivity against the omicron variant was reduced by approximately 47%. Responses against spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens from endemic hCoVs were significantly more extensive in COVID-19 survivors than in unexposed subjects and displayed cross-reactivity between \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs. In some, non-SARS hCoV-specific T cells demonstrated a prominent non-reciprocal cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antigens, whereas a distinct anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunological repertoire emerged post-COVID-19, with relatively limited cross-recognition of non-SARS hCoVs. Based on this cross-reactivity pattern, we established a strategy for in-vitro expansion of universal anti-hCoV T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Overall, these results have implications for the future design of universal vaccines and cell-based immune therapies against SARS- and non-SARS-CoVs.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2", "SARS-CoV-2 variants", "cross-reactive T cells", "human coronavirus", "multicoronavirus-specific T cells", "omicron"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "RNA, Viral", "Coronavirus OC43, Human"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mithil K", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edoardo", "Last Name": "Migliori", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Amer", "Last Name": "Assal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hei Ton", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Khatiwada", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rodica", "Last Name": "Ciubotariu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marcus R", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "De Giorgi", "Affiliation": "Department of Transfusion Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pawel J", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37820009", "Title": "Donor-derived regulatory dendritic cell infusion modulates effector CD8+ T cell and NK cell responses after liver transplantation.", "Abstract": "Immune cell-based therapies are promising strategies to facilitate immunosuppression withdrawal after organ transplantation.

Here, we performed clinical monitoring and comprehensive assessment of peripheral and allograft tissue immune cell populations in DCreg-infused live-donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients up to 12 months (M) after transplant. Thirteen patients were given a single infusion of donor-derived DCreg 1 week before transplant (STUDY) and were compared with 40 propensity-matched standard-of-care (SOC) patients. Donor-derived DCreg infusion was well tolerated in all STUDY patients. There were no differences in postoperative complications or biopsy-confirmed acute rejection compared with SOC patients up to 12M. DCreg administration was associated with lower frequencies of effector T-bet+Eomes+CD8+ T cells and CD16bright natural killer (NK) cells and an increase in putative tolerogenic CD141+CD163+ DCs compared with SOC at 12M. Antidonor proliferative capacity of interferon-\u03b3+ (IFN-\u03b3+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was lower compared with antithird party responses in STUDY participants, but not in SOC patients, at 12M. In addition, lower circulating concentrations of interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), IFN-\u03b3, and CXCL10 were detected in STUDY participants compared with SOC patients at 12M. Analysis of 12M allograft biopsies revealed lower frequencies of graft-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, as well as attenuation of cytolytic TH1 effector genes and pathways among intragraft CD8+ T cells and NK cells, in DCreg-infused patients.

Treatment of thymus grafts with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) increased the proportion of stem cells derived from injected HSCs, delayed onset of autoimmune disease, reduced early T cell reconstitution, and reduced effector/memory T cell conversion. Younger neonatal human thymus tissue was associated with improved T cell reconstitution.

Therefore, T cell-focused vaccination or cellular immunotherapy might provide enhanced protection for immunocompromised patients. Pre-existing T cell memory recognizing SARS-CoV2 antigens antedating COVID-19 infection or vaccination, may have developed as an imprint of prior infections with endemic non-SARS human coronaviruses (hCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, pathogens of \"common cold\". In turn, SARS-CoV2-primed T cells may recognize emerging variants or other hCoV viruses and modulate the course of subsequent hCoV infections. Cross-immunity between hCoVs and SARS-CoV2 has not been well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated T cell responses against the immunodominant SARS-CoV2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and corresponding antigens from \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs among vaccinated, convalescent, and unexposed subjects. Broad T cell immunity against all tested SARS-CoV2 antigens emerged in COVID-19 survivors. In convalescent and in vaccinated individuals, SARS-CoV2 spike-specific T cells reliably recognized most SARS-CoV2 variants, however cross-reactivity against the omicron variant was reduced by approximately 50%. Responses against spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens from endemic hCoVs were more extensive in COVID-19 survivors than in unexposed subjects and displayed cross-reactivity between \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs. In some, non-SARS hCoVspecific T cells demonstrated a prominent non-reciprocal cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV2 antigens, whereas a distinct anti-SARS-CoV2 immunological repertoire emerged post-COVID-19, with relatively limited cross-recognition of non-SARS hCoVs. Based on this cross-reactivity pattern, we established a strategy for in-vitro expansion of universal anti-hCoV T cells for adoptive immunotherapy.

In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed on a compassionate use basis, and xenotransplantation experiments using pig kidneys in deceased human recipients provided encouraging data. Many advances in xenotransplantation have resulted from improvements in the ability to genetically modify pigs using CRISPR-Cas9 and other methodologies. Gene editing has the capacity to generate pig organs that more closely resemble those of humans and are hence more physiologically compatible and less prone to rejection. Despite such modifications, immune responses to xenografts remain powerful and multi-faceted, involving innate immune components that do not attack allografts.

Injection of aBM cells directly into the BM cavity, transgenic expression of hematopoietic cytokines, and coinfusion of human BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells synergized to enhance long-term B cell and monocyte levels in PI mice. These improvements allow a sustained time frame of 18-22 wk where APCs and T cells are present and greater flexibility for modeling immune disease pathogenesis and immunotherapies in PI mice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Liver", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Nauman", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nichole M", "Last Name": "Danzl", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jaeyop", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Borsotti", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Madley", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Markus A", "Last Name": "H\u00f6lzl", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Dahmani", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Akaitz", "Last Name": "Dorronsoro Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "\u00c9stefania", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Suxiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Prakash", "Last Name": "Satwani", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY; megan.sykes@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2022Apr01"}, {"PMID": "35291378", "Title": "Integrated Analysis Toolset for Defining and Tracking Alloreactive T-cell Clones After Human Solid Organ and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.", "Abstract": "We have developed a suite of tools for integrated analysis of T-Cell-Receptor Sequencing data to define and track alloreactive T-cells in human transplant studies.

The induction of transplantation tolerance - the lack of destructive immune responses to a transplanted organ in the absence of immunosuppression - could potentially overcome these limitations. Immune tolerance to kidney allografts from living donors has been successfully achieved in humans through clinical protocols based on chimerism induction with hematopoietic cell transplantation after non-myeloablative conditioning. Notably, two of these protocols have led to immune tolerance in a significant fraction of HLA-mismatched donor-recipient combinations, which represent the large majority of cases in clinical practice. Studies in mice and large animals have been critical in dissecting tolerance mechanisms and in selecting the most promising approaches for human translation. However, there are several key differences in tolerance induction between these models and humans, including the rate of success and stability of donor chimerism, as well as the relative contribution of different mechanisms in inducing donor-specific unresponsiveness. Kidney allograft tolerance achieved through durable full-donor chimerism may be due to central deletion of graft-reactive donor T cells, even though mechanistic data from patient series are lacking. On the other hand, immune tolerance attained with transient mixed chimerism-based protocols initially relies on Treg-mediated suppression, followed by peripheral deletion of donor-reactive recipient T-cell clones under antigenic pressure from the graft. These conclusions were supported by data deriving from novel high-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing approaches that allowed tracking of alloreactive repertoires over time. In this review, we summarize the most important mechanistic studies on tolerance induction with combined kidney-bone marrow transplantation in humans, discussing open issues that still need to be addressed and focusing on techniques developed in recent years to efficiently monitor the alloresponse in tolerance trials. These cutting-edge methods will be instrumental for the development of immune tolerance protocols with improved efficacy and to identify patients amenable to safe immunosuppression withdrawal.", "Keywords": ["chimerism and tolerance", "clinical protocol", "kidney", "mixed chimerism", "transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Allografts", "Animals", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Transplantation", "Transplantation Chimera", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation Tolerance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manuel Alfredo", "Last Name": "Podest\u00e0", "Affiliation": "Renal Division, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34902607", "Title": "Modeling human T1D-associated autoimmune processes.", "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by impaired immune tolerance to \u03b2-cell antigens and progressive destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells.

Donor T cell macrochimerism (\u22654%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism.

In contrast, blood and graft IGHV repertoires from the same samples showed minimal overlap. Coronary infiltrates included CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells expressing inflammatory (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and profibrotic (TGF\u03b2) cytokines. These were distinguishable from the peripheral blood based on memory, activation, and tissue residency markers (CD45RO, CTLA-4, and CD69). Importantly, high-frequency rearrangements were traced back to endomyocardial biopsies (2-6\u00a0years prior).

In human T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, T cells reactive to autoantigens are thought to escape negative selection, traffic to the periphery and attack self-tissues. However, physiological thymic negative selection of autoreactive human T cells has not been previously studied. We now describe a human T-cell receptor-transgenic humanized mouse model that permits the study of autoreactive T-cell development in a human thymus. Our studies demonstrate that thymocytes expressing the autoreactive Clone 5 TCR, which recognizes insulin B:9-23 presented by HLA-DQ8, are efficiently negatively selected at the double and single positive stage in human immune systems derived from HLA-DQ8+ HSCs. In the absence of hematopoietic expression of the HLA restriction element, negative selection of Clone 5 is less efficient and restricted to the single positive stage. To our knowledge, these data provide the first demonstration of negative selection of human T cells recognizing a naturally-expressed tissue-restricted antigen. Intrathymic antigen presenting cells are required to delete less mature thymocytes, while presentation by medullary thymic epithelial cells may be sufficient to delete more mature single positive cells.

With recent progress in xenotransplantation permitting porcine organ graft survival of months or even years in nonhuman primates, there is renewed interest in its potential to alleviate the organ shortage. Many of these advances are the result of our heightened capacity to modify pigs genetically, particularly with the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing methodologies. Although this approach allows the engineering of pig organs that are less prone to rejection, the clinical application of xenotransplantation will require the ability to avoid the ravages of a multifaceted attack on the immune system while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms.

The clinical studies are focused on mechanisms of tolerance involved in a protocol carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in HLA-mismatched haploidentical combinations for the induction of renal allograft tolerance. These studies, in which chimerism was only transient and GVHD did not occur, suggest an early role for donor-specific regulatory T cells in tolerance induction, followed by partial and gradual deletion of donor-reactive T cells. We utilized high-throughput sequencing methodologies in a novel way to identify and track large numbers of alloreactive T cell receptors (TCRs). This method has been shown to identify biologically significant alloreactive TCRs in transplant patients and pointed to clonal deletion as a major mechanism of long-term tolerance in these patients. More recently, we adapted this sequencing method to optimally identify the donor-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) repertoire. Interrogation of the early posttransplant repertoire demonstrated expansion of donor-specific Tregs in association with tolerance. Our studies suggest a role for the kidney graft in tolerance by these mechanisms in patients who had only transient chimerism. Nonhuman primate studies indicate that other organs, including the heart, the lungs and the liver, are less readily tolerated following a period of transient mixed chimerism. Our efforts to extend the reach of mixed chimerism for tolerance induction beyond the kidney are therefore focused on the addition of recipient Tregs to the protocol.

humanized anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody, has been used in conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation and tolerance induction with combined kidney-bone marrow transplantation. Siplizumab-based tolerance induction regimens deplete T cells globally while enriching regulatory T cells (Tregs) early posttransplantation. Siplizumab inhibits allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) in vitro. We compared the impact of siplizumab on Tregs versus other T cell subsets in HLA-mismatched allogeneic MLRs using PBMCs. Siplizumab predominantly reduced the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells, which express higher CD2 levels than na\u00efve T cells or resting Tregs. Conversely, siplizumab enriched proliferating CD45RA- FoxP3HI cells in MLRs. FoxP3 expression was stable over time in siplizumab-containing cultures, consistent with enrichment for bona fide Tregs. Consistently, high-throughput TCR\u03b2 CDR3 sequencing of sorted unstimulated and proliferating T cells in MLRs revealed selective expansion of donor-reactive Tregs along with depletion of donor-reactive CD4+ effector/memory T cells in siplizumab-containing MLRs. These results indicate that siplizumab may have immunomodulatory functions that may contribute to its success in tolerance-inducing regimens.

Here we explored this issue in humanized mice with functional human lymphohematopoietic systems, which were constructed by transplantation of human CD34+ cells alone, or along with human fetal thymus into NOD/SCID/\u03b3c-/- (NSG) or NSG mice carrying human SCF/GM-CSF/IL-3 transgenes (SGM3). In comparison with humanized NSG (huNSG) mice, huSGM3 mice had higher human myeloid reconstitution and aggressive expansion of human CD4+ memory T cells, particularly in the absence of human thymus. Although all huNSG mice appeared healthy throughout the observation period of over 20 weeks, huSGM3 mice developed fatal disease characterized by severe human T cell and macrophage infiltrations to systemic organs. HuSGM3 mice also showed severe anemia and thrombocytopenia with hypoplastic bone marrow, but increased reticulocyte counts in blood. In addition, huSGM3 mice showed a significant elevation in human inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-18, IFN-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b3, faithfully reproducing HLH in clinical situations.

We have optimized a method for identifying the donor-specific Treg repertoire and used it to interrogate the fate of donor-specific Tregs after CKBMT. We expanded Tregs with several different protocols. Using functional analyses and T cell receptor sequencing, we found that expanding sorted Tregs with activated donor B cells identified the broadest Treg repertoire with the greatest potency and donor specificity of suppression. This method outperformed both alloantigen stimulation with CTLA4Ig and sequencing of CFSElo cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient.

These advances reflect the application of new scientific knowledge, improved immunosuppressive agents, and genetic engineering. The field has recently enjoyed a renaissance of interest and hope, largely due to the exponential increase in our capacity to genetically engineer porcine source animals. However, immune responses to xenografts are very powerful and widespread clinical application of xenotransplantation will depend on the ability to suppress these immune responses while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. Our work over the last three decades has aimed to engineer the immune system of the recipient in a manner that achieves specific tolerance to the xenogeneic donor while preserving otherwise normal immune function. Important proofs of principle have been obtained, first in rodents, and later in human immune systems in \"humanized mice\" and finally in non-human primates, demonstrating the capacity and potential synergy of mixed xenogeneic chimerism and xenogeneic thymic transplantation in tolerizing multiple arms of the immune system. Considering the fact that clinical tolerance has recently been achieved for allografts and the even greater importance of avoiding excessive immunosuppression for xenografts, it is my belief that it is both possible and imperative that we likewise achieve xenograft tolerance.

Nevertheless, current manufacturing of Tregs as a cellular medicinal product varies between different laboratories, which in turn hampers precise comparisons of the results between the studies performed. While the number of clinical trials testing Tregs is already substantial, it seems to be crucial to provide some standardized characteristics of Treg products in order to minimize the problem. We have previously developed reporting guidelines called minimum information about tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells, which allows the comparison between different preparations of tolerance-inducing antigen-presenting cells. Having this experience, here we describe another minimum information about Tregs (MITREG). It is important to note that MITREG does not dictate how investigators should generate or characterize Tregs, but it does require investigators to report their Treg data in a consistent and transparent manner. We hope this will, therefore, be a useful tool facilitating standardized reporting on the manufacturing of Tregs, either for research purposes or for clinical application. This way MITREG might also be an important step toward more standardized and reproducible testing of the Tregs preparations in clinical applications.", "Keywords": ["T regulatory cells", "cell

Moreover, immune responses tend to be stronger in female vs male humans and mice. Because it is challenging to distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic influences on human immune responses, we used a personalized immune (PI) humanized mouse model, in which immune systems were generated de novo from adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in immunodeficient mice. We assessed the effect of recipient sex and of donor autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes [T1D] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) on human B-cell development in PI mice. We observed that human B-cell levels were increased in female recipients regardless of the source of human HSCs or the strain of immunodeficient recipient mice. Moreover, mice injected with T1D- or RA-derived HSCs displayed B-cell abnormalities compared with healthy control HSC-derived mice, including altered B-cell levels, increased proportions of mature B cells and reduced CD19 expression. Our study revealed an HSC-extrinsic effect of recipient sex on human B-cell reconstitution. Moreover, the PI humanized mouse model revealed HSC-intrinsic defects in central B-cell tolerance that recapitulated those in patients with autoimmune diseases.

Performing liver transplantation in cynomolgus monkeys is challenging because they poorly tolerate portal vein clamping during the anhepatic phase.

We used 3 different techniques to perform 5 liver transplants in male cynomolgus macaques (weight, 7.4-10.8 kg; mismatched for MHC I and II; matched for ABO). In procedure A, we clamped the portal vein briefly, as in human transplants, as well as the superior mesentery artery to minimize congestion at the expense of temporary ischemia (n = 2). In procedure B, we performed a temporary portocaval shunt with extracorporeal venovenous bypass (n = 1). For procedure C, we developed an H-shunt system (modified portocaval shunt) with extracorporeal bypass (n = 2). Postoperative immunosuppression comprised cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Recipients in procedure A developed hemodynamic instability and were euthanized within 2 d. The recipient that underwent procedure B was euthanized within 11 d due to inferior vena caval thrombosis. The H-shunt in procedure C led to minimal PV congestion during the anhepatic phase, and both recipients reached the 21-d survival endpoint with good graft function. Our novel H-shunt bypass system resulted in successful liver transplantation in cynomolgus macaques, with long-term posttransplant survival possible.

Upon transplantation in immunodeficient mice, grafted cells form vascularized islet-like structures containing MAFA/C-peptide-positive cells.

Importantly, NT-ES-\u03b2-cells maintain normal blood glucose levels after ablation of the mouse endogenous \u03b2-cells. Cystic structures, but no teratomas, were observed in NT-ES-\u03b2-cell grafts. Isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell lines showed greater variability in \u03b2-cell differentiation. Even though different methods of somatic cell reprogramming result in stem cell lines that are molecularly indistinguishable, full differentiation competence is more common in ES cell lines than in induced pluripotent stem cell lines.

In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections.

GVH-reactive primed T cells showed marked loss of cytotoxic function and activation, and delayed but not decreased proliferation or accumulation in lymphoid tissues when transferred to quiescent mixed chimeras compared with freshly irradiated secondary recipients. Primed CD4 and CD8 T cells provided mutual help to sustain these functions in both subsets. CD8 help for CD4 cells was largely IFN-\u03b3 dependent.

Chronic rejection and drug-induced morbidities are major limitations that could be overcome by allograft tolerance induction. Tolerance was first intentionally induced in humans via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT), but the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are incompletely understood. We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover.

Although coinhibitory checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Ab can restore functions to exhausted T cell populations, recovery is often incomplete and dependent upon the pool size of a quiescent T-bet(high) subset that expresses lower levels of PD-1. In a model in which unhelped, HY-specific CD8(+) T cells gradually lose function following transfer to male bone marrow transplantation recipients, we have explored the effect of shifting the balance away from coinhibition and toward costimulation by combining anti-PD-L1 with agonistic Abs to the TNFR superfamily members, OX40 and CD27. Several weeks following T cell transfer, both agonistic Abs, but especially anti-CD27, demonstrated synergy with anti-PD-L1 by enhancing CD8(+) T cell proliferation and effector cytokine generation. Anti-CD27 and anti-PD-L1 synergized by downregulating the expression of multiple quiescence-related genes concomitant with a reduced frequency of T-bet(high) cells within the exhausted population. However, in the presence of persistent Ag, the CD8(+) T cell response was not sustained and the overall size of the effector cytokine-producing pool eventually contracted to levels below that of controls. Thus, CD27-mediated costimulation can synergize with coinhibitory checkpoint blockade to switch off molecular programs for quiescence in exhausted T cell populations, but at the expense of losing precursor cells required to maintain a response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Animals", "Antibodies", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "OX40 Ligand", "Receptors, OX40", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7", "Tumor Necrosis Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Buchan", "Affiliation": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Manzo", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Flutter", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Rogel", "Affiliation": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton."}, {"First Name": "Noha", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Shivajanani", "Last Name": "Sivakumaran", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Ghorashian", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Clare", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}, {"First Name": "Gordon J", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Croft", "Affiliation": "Institute of Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla."}, {"First Name": "Aymen", "Last Name": "Al-Shamkhani", "Affiliation": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton."}, {"First Name": "Ronjon", "Last Name": "Chakraverty", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Immunology Group, Cancer Institute and Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2015Jan01"}, {"PMID": "25268247", "Title": "Tribute to Carl-Gustav Groth (1933-2014), first president of the International Xenotransplantation Association.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Research", "Societies, Scientific", "Sweden", "Transplantation, Heterologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David K C", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leo", "Last Name": "Buhler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Breimer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olle", "Last Name": "Korsgren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Annika", "Last Name": "Tibell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Wennberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Cozzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anthony J F", "Last Name": "d'Apice", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bernhard", "Last Name": "Hering", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian F C", "Last Name": "McKenzie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard N", "Last Name": "Pierson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takaaki", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Xenotransplantation", "PubDate": "2014Mar-Apr"}, {"PMID": "24591363", "Title": "Xenograft tolerance and immune function of human T cells developing in pig thymus xenografts.", "Abstract": "Transplantation of xenogeneic thymus tissue allows xenograft tolerance induction in the highly disparate pig-to-mouse model. Fetal swine thymus (SW THY) can support the generation of a diverse human T cell repertoire that is tolerant of the pig in vitro. We demonstrate that SW THY generates all human T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), in similar numbers as fetal human thymus (HU THY) grafts in immunodeficient mice receiving the same human CD34(+) cells. Peripheral T cells are specifically tolerant to the mouse and to the human and porcine donors, with robust responses to nondonor human and pig Ags. Specific tolerance is observed to pig skin grafts sharing the THY donor MHC. SW THY-generated peripheral Tregs show similar function, but include lower percentages of naive-type Tregs compared with HU THY-generated Tregs. Tregs contribute to donor-pig specific tolerance. Peripheral human T cells generated in SW THY exhibit reduced proportions of CD8(+) T cells and reduced lymphopenia-driven proliferation and memory-type conversion, accelerated decay of memory-type cells, and reduced responses to protein Ags. Thus, SW thymus transplantation is a powerful xenotolerance approach for human T cells.

A total of 10 patients with ESRD and MM have been treated with this initial protocol. Only 2 recipients developed evidence of reversible renal allograft rejection after stopping immunosuppression. Long-term (up to 14 years) operational renal allograft tolerance has been observed in all 10 patients, even in those with transient hematopoietic chimerism. Control of the MM has been less complete, as recurrent disease developed in five of these patients, three of whom expired. Nevertheless, in view of the essentially 100% 3-5 year mortality typically expected with alternative treatments for this challenging population, it has been suggested that combined kidney and donor bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) following non-myeloablative conditioning should become the standard therapy for patients with ESRD secondary to MM (27). These encouraging results, as well as the acceptable morbidity observed in cancer patients receiving non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched bone marrow transplantation in our center, led us to next evaluate CKBMT in 10 patients of HLA-mismatched transplants. All 10 subjects developed transient chimerism and in seven of these, immunosuppression was successfully discontinued. Four subjects continue to be immunosuppression free for periods of 4.5-11 years, while in three, reinstitution of immunosuppression was advised or accomplished after 5-8 years due to recurrence of original disease or chronic antibody mediated rejection. Donor-specific antibodies were frequently detectable in the earlier recipients. In contrast, no donor-specific antibodies were detected after immunosuppression was discontinued in the last four subjects, who showed more consistent and durable B-cell depletion. In conclusion, our studies have shown that immunosuppression-free renal allograft survival can be achieved in both HLAmatched and mismatched donor-recipient pairs, with follow up times now of greater than 14 years after induction of transient chimerism through CKBMT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "HLA Antigens", "Histocompatibility Testing", "Humans", "Isoantibodies", "Kidney Transplantation", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Myeloablative Agonists", "Primates", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation Chimera", "Transplantation Tolerance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "A Benedict", "Last Name": "Cosimi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatsuo", "Last Name": "Kawai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplants", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23260195", "Title": "Distribution and compartmentalization of human circulating and tissue-resident memory T cell subsets.", "Abstract": "Knowledge of human T\u00a0cells derives chiefly from studies of peripheral blood, whereas their distribution and function in tissues remains largely unknown.
