However, in many African countries there has been a poor uptake of COVID-19 vaccines with only 32.5% first vaccine dose coverage compared to the WHO global target of 70%. As vaccine access improves, one of the important drivers of low uptake has been vaccine hesitancy, driven by levels of confidence, convenience, and complacency. Between 4 January-11 February 2022, we conducted a survey of vaccine late adopters to assess factors that influenced adults in Harare, Zimbabwe to present for their first COVID-19 vaccine dose almost 12 months after the vaccination program began. Of the 1016 adults enrolled, 50% were female and 12.4% had HIV co-infection. Binary logistic regression models were developed to understand factors associated with vaccine confidence. Women were more likely to have negative views about the COVID-19 vaccine compared to men (OR 1.51 (95%CI 1.16, 1.97, p = 0.002). Older adults (\u226540 years) compared with youth (18-25 years) were more likely to have 'major concerns' about vaccines. When asked about their concerns, 602 (59.3%) considered immediate side effects as a major concern and 520 (52.1%) were concerned about long-term health effects. People living with HIV (PLWH) were more likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 1.71 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.74, p = 0.025) and effective (1.68 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.64, p = 0.026). Internet users were less likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95, p = 0.021) compared to non-Internet users; and social media was a more likely source of information for youth and those with higher education. Family members were the primary key influencers for 560 (55.2%) participants. The most important reason for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine for 715 (70.4%) participants was the protection of individual health.

This approach encompasses special groups at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as preterm infants and pregnant women, as well as those with chronic and immune-compromising medical conditions or at increased risk of disease due to immunosenescence. Despite demonstrations of effectiveness and safety, vaccine uptake in these special groups is frequently lower than expected, even in developed countries with vaccination strategies in place. For example, uptake of the influenza vaccine in pregnancy rarely exceeds 50% in developed countries and, although data are scarce, it appears that only half of preterm infants are up-to-date with routine paediatric vaccinations. Many people with chronic medical conditions or who are immunocompromised due to disease or aging are also under-vaccinated. In the US, coverage among people aged 65years or older was 67% for the influenza vaccine in the 2014-2015 season and 55-60% for tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines in 2013, while the coverage rate for herpes zoster vaccination among those aged 60years or older was only 24%. In most other countries, rates are far lower. Reasons for under-vaccination of special groups include fear of adverse outcomes or illness caused by the vaccine, the inconvenience (and in some settings, cost) of vaccination and lack of awareness of the need for vaccination or national recommendations. There is also evidence that healthcare providers' attitudes towards vaccination are among the most important influences on the decision to vaccinate. It is clear that physicians' adherence to recommendations needs to be improved, particularly where patients receive care from multiple subspecialists and receive little or no care from primary care providers.", "Keywords": ["Adolescent", "Immunocompromised", "Older adults", "Pregnancy", "Preterm", "Special group"], "MeSH terms": ["Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Global Health", "Humans", "Vaccination", "Vulnerable Populations"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Doherty", "Affiliation": "GSK Vaccines, Avenue Fleming 20, Parc de la Noire Epine, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium.

In addition, the long-term benefits of immunisation in reducing or eliminating infectious diseases may induce complacency due to the absence of cases. However, as demonstrated in recent measles outbreaks in Europe and United States, reappearance of the disease occurs as soon as vaccine coverage falls. Unfounded vaccine scares such as those associating the combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with autism, and whole-cell pertussis vaccines with encephalopathy, can also have massive impacts, resulting in reduced vaccine uptake and disease resurgence. The safety assessment of vaccines is exhaustive and continuous; beginning with non-clinical evaluation of their individual components in terms of purity, stability and sterility, continuing throughout the clinical development phase and entire duration of use of the vaccine; including post-approval. The breadth and depth of safety assessments conducted at multiple levels by a range of independent organizations increases confidence in the rigour with which any potential risks or side-effects are investigated and managed. Industry, regulatory agencies, academia, the medical community and the general public all play a role in monitoring vaccine safety. Within these stakeholder groups, the healthcare professional and vaccine provider have key roles in the prevention, identification, investigation and management of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Guidelines and algorithms aid in determining whether AEFI may have been caused by the vaccine, or whether it is coincidental to it. Healthcare providers are encouraged to rigorously investigate AEFIs and to report them via local reporting processes. The ultimate objective for all parties is to ensure vaccines have a favourable benefit-risk profile.", "Keywords": ["Adverse event", "Safety", "Surveillance", "Vaccine"], "MeSH terms": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Humans", "Product Surveillance, Postmarketing", "Vaccines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alberta", "Last Name": "Di Pasquale", "Affiliation": "GSK Vaccines, Avenue Fleming 20, Parc de la Noire Epine, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium.

Only 30% were likely to use either product for prevention of BV; 76% if high risk for BV; 83% treatment of BV. Anticipated FOB involvement in decision-making included that 46% would ask his opinion, 38% would inform him of the decision and 7% would need approval.

The aim of this article is to review studies on vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers (HCPs), and the influences of their own vaccine confidence and vaccination behaviour on their vaccination recommendations to others. The search strategy was developed in Medline and then adapted across several multidisciplinary mainstream databases including Embase Classic & Embase, and PschInfo. All foreign language articles were included if the abstract was available in English. A total of 185 articles were included in the literature review. 66% studied the vaccine hesitancy among HCPs, 17% analysed concerns, attitudes and/or behaviour of HCPs towards vaccinating others, and 9% were about evaluating intervention(s). Overall, knowledge about particular vaccines, their efficacy and safety, helped to build HCPs own confidence in vaccines and their willingness to recommend vaccines to others. The importance of societal endorsement and support from colleagues was also reported. In the face of emerging vaccine hesitancy, HCPs still remain the most trusted advisor and influencer of vaccination decisions. The capacity and confidence of HCPs, though, are stretched as they are faced with time constraints, increased workload and limited resources, and often have inadequate information or training support to address parents' questions. Overall, HCPs need more support to manage the quickly evolving vaccine environment as well as changing public, especially those who are reluctant or refuse vaccination. Some recommended strategies included strengthening trust between HCPs, health authorities and policymakers, through more shared involvement in the establishment of vaccine recommendations.", "Keywords": ["Healthcare provider", "Vaccination", "Vaccine hesitancy"], "MeSH terms": ["Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Vaccination", "Vaccines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pauline", "Last Name": "Paterson", "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom.
