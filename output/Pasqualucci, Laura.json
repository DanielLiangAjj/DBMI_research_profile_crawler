Yet there is a lack of systematic identification of chromatin crosstalk mechanisms, limiting our understanding of the dynamic transition between chromatin states during development and disease. Here we perform co-dependency mapping of genes using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated fitness screens in pan-cancer cell lines to quantify gene-gene functional relationships. We identify 145 co-dependency modules and further define the molecular context underlying the essentiality of these modules by incorporating mutational, epigenome, gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles of cell lines. These analyses assign new protein complex composition and function, and predict new functional interactions, including an unexpected co-dependency between two transcriptionally counteracting chromatin complexes - polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and MLL-MEN1 complex. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation regulates the genome-wide distribution of MLL1 and MEN1. In lymphoma cells with EZH2 gain-of-function mutations, the re-localization of MLL-MEN1 complex drives oncogenic gene expression and results in a hypersensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of MEN1. Together, our findings provide a resource for discovery of trans-regulatory interactions as mechanisms of chromatin regulation and potential targets of synthetic lethality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2", "Histones", "Chromatin", "Neoplasms", "Lymphoma"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yinglu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinjing", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Estrella", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel A", "Last Name": "Pazos", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John T", "Last Name": "McGuire", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dimitris", "Last Name": "Karagiannis", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Varun", "Last Name": "Sahu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mustafo", "Last Name": "Mustafokulov", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudio", "Last Name": "Scuoppo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francisco J", "Last Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Rivera", "Affiliation": "David H.

The incidence varies worldwide, with a majority affecting developing countries. Here, we present a comparative analysis of virus-positive and virus-negative tumors in nine cancers linked to five viruses. We find that virus-positive tumors occur more frequently in males and show geographical disparities in incidence. Genomic analysis of 1,658 tumors reveals virus-positive tumors exhibit distinct mutation signatures and driver gene mutations and possess a lower somatic mutation burden compared to virus-negative tumors of the same cancer type. For example, compared to the respective virus-negative counterparts, virus-positive cases across different cancer histologies had less often mutations of TP53 and deletions of 9p21.3/ CDKN2 A- CDKN1A ; Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) gastric cancer had more frequent mutations of EIF4A1 and ARID1A and less marked mismatch repair deficiency signatures; and EBV-positive cHL had fewer somatic genetic lesions of JAK-STAT, NF-\u03baB, PI3K-AKT and HLA-I genes and a less pronounced activity of the aberrant somatic hypermutation signature. In cHL, we also identify germline homozygosity in HLA class I as a potential risk factor for the development of EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. Finally, an analysis of clinical trials of PD-(L)1 inhibitors in four virus-associated cancers suggested an association of viral infection with higher response rate in patients receiving such treatments, which was particularly evident in gastric cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

The high proliferation of GC B cells coupled with occasional errors in the DNA-modifying processes of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination put the cell at a risk to obtain transforming genetic aberrations, which may activate proto-oncogenes or inactivate tumour suppressor genes. Several subtypes of GC lymphomas harbor genetic mutations leading to constitutive, aberrant activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. In normal B cells, NF-\u03baB has crucial biological roles in development and physiology. GC lymphomas highjack these activities to promote tumour-cell growth and survival. It has become increasingly clear that the separate canonical and non-canonical routes of the NF-\u03baB pathway and the five downstream NF-\u03baB transcription factors have distinct functions in the successive stages of GC B-cell development. These findings may have direct implications for understanding how aberrant NF-\u03baB activation promotes the genesis of various GC lymphomas corresponding to the developmentally distinct GC B-cell subsets. The knowledge arising from these studies may be explored for the development of precision medicine approaches aimed at more effective treatments of the corresponding tumours with specific NF-\u03baB inhibitors, thus reducing systemic toxicity.

"Diffuse large B\u00a0cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets1-5. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Down-Regulation", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse", "Mutation", "Oncogenes", "Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "Repressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elodie", "Last Name": "Bal", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Hadigol", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antony B", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura K", "Last Name": "Hilton", "Affiliation": "Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jui Wan", "Last Name": "Loh", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kostiantyn", "Last Name": "Dreval", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jasper C H", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sofija", "Last Name": "Vlasevska", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa", "Last Name": "Corinaldesi", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "Basso", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan D", "Last Name": "Morin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. lp171@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Dalla-Favera", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rd10@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2022Jul"}, {"PMID": "35095922", "Title": "Tracking Immunoglobulin Repertoire and Transcriptomic Changes in Germinal Center B Cells by Single-Cell Analysis.", "Abstract": "In response to T-cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), which are histological structures deputed to antibody affinity maturation, a process associated with immunoglobulin gene editing by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR).

Here, we characterize 98 tumors and 12 isogenic cell lines harboring SF3B1 hotspot mutations, identifying hundreds of cryptic 3' splice sites common and specific to different cancer types. Regulatory network analysis revealed that the most common SF3B1 mutation activates MYC via effects conserved across human and mouse cells. SF3B1 mutations promote decay of transcripts encoding the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit PPP2R5A, increasing MYC S62 and BCL2 S70 phosphorylation which, in turn, promotes MYC protein stability and impair apoptosis, respectively. Genetic PPP2R5A restoration or pharmacologic PP2A activation impaired SF3B1-mutant tumorigenesis, elucidating a therapeutic approach to aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1.

In this Review, we provide a concise overview of the most promising epigenetic therapies for the treatment of lymphomas, including inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs), protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs) and isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs), and highlight the most promising future directions of research in this area.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Humans", "Lymphoma"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sermer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Guido", "Last Name": "Wendel", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ari", "Last Name": "Melnick", "Affiliation": "Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anas", "Last Name": "Younes", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. younesa@mskcc.org."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

receptor (BCR) controls cellular survival, surface BCR expression is conserved in most mature B-cell lymphomas. The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt lymphoma. Whereas BCR ablation does not, per se, significantly affect lymphoma growth, BCR-negative (BCR-) tumour cells rapidly disappear in the presence of their BCR-expressing (BCR+) counterparts in vitro and in vivo. This requires neither cellular contact nor factors released by BCR+ tumour cells. Instead, BCR loss induces the rewiring of central carbon metabolism, increasing the sensitivity of receptor-less lymphoma cells to nutrient restriction. The BCR attenuates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) activity to support MYC-controlled gene expression. BCR- tumour cells exhibit increased GSK3\u03b2 activity and are rescued from their competitive growth disadvantage by GSK3\u03b2 inhibition. BCR- lymphoma variants that restore competitive fitness normalize GSK3\u03b2 activity after constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly through Ras mutations. Similarly, in Burkitt lymphoma, activating RAS mutations may propagate immunoglobulin-crippled tumour cells, which usually represent a minority of the tumour bulk. Thus, while BCR expression enhances lymphoma cell fitness, BCR-targeted therapies may profit from combinations with drugs targeting BCR- tumour cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Burkitt Lymphoma", "Carbon", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genes, myc", "Genes, ras", "Genetic Fitness", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta", "Humans", "Lymphoma", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriele", "Last Name": "Varano", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Raffel", "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Sormani", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Federica", "Last Name": "Zanardi", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Lonardi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Section of Pathology, University of Brescia, Spedali Civili, 25123 Brescia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Christin", "Last Name": "Zasada", "Affiliation": "Max-Delbr\u00fcck-Center of Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, 13125 Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Perucho", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Petrocelli", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Haake", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Albert K", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mattia", "Last Name": "Bugatti", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Section of Pathology, University of Brescia, Spedali Civili, 25123 Brescia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Ulrike", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Eelco", "Last Name": "Van Anken", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics and Cell Biology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reiner", "Last Name": "Siebert", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Kempa", "Affiliation": "Max-Delbr\u00fcck-Center of Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, 13125 Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Maurilio", "Last Name": "Ponzoni", "Affiliation": "Ateneo Vita Salute and San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Pathology and Lymphoid Malignancies Units, 20132 Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Fabio", "Last Name": "Facchetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Section of Pathology, University of Brescia, Spedali Civili, 25123 Brescia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Klaus", "Last Name": "Rajewsky", "Affiliation": "Max-Delbr\u00fcck-Center of Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, 13125 Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Casola", "Affiliation": "IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2017Jun08"}, {"PMID": "28378425", "Title": "Follicular lymphoma: State-of-the-art ICML workshop in Lugano 2015.", "Abstract": "The 13th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma held in Lugano in June 2015 was preceded by a closed workshop (organized in collaboration with the American Association for Cancer Research and the European School of Oncology) with the aim of developing an up-to-date understanding of the biology of follicular lymphoma and the clinical implications of new findings in the field.

However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.Significance: Loss-of-function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

These findings may have relevant implications for the design of clinical trials aimed at assessing the use of mutational profiling to inform therapeutic decisions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Education, Medical, Continuing", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Phosphoproteins", "Prognosis", "RNA Splicing Factors", "Receptor, Notch1", "Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear", "Risk Factors", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it"}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Rasi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alessio", "Last Name": "Bruscaggin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Monti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmela", "Last Name": "Ciardullo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Deambrogi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Serra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Bertoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Forconi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Laurenti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Marasca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Dal-Bo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesca Maria", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Bulian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Josep", "Last Name": "Nomdedeu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Del Poeta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valter", "Last Name": "Gattei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Fo\u00e0", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Dalla-Favera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gianluca", "Last Name": "Gaidano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Feb21"}]
