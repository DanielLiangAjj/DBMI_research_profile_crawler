Notable exceptions include several naturally ligand-regulated transcription factors, including our prior work with the heterodimeric HIF-2 transcription factor which showed that small molecule binding within an internal pocket of the HIF-2\u03b1 PAS-B domain can disrupt its interactions with its dimerization partner, ARNT. Here, we explore the feasibility of similarly targeting small molecules to the analogous ARNT PAS-B domain itself, potentially opening a promising route to simultaneously modulate several ARNT-mediated signaling pathways. Using solution NMR screening of an in-house fragment library, we previously identified several compounds that bind ARNT PAS-B and, in certain cases, antagonize ARNT association with the TACC3 transcriptional coactivator. However, these ligands have only modest binding affinities, complicating characterization of their binding sites. We address this challenge by combining NMR, MD simulations, and ensemble docking to identify ligand-binding 'hotspots' on and within the ARNT PAS-B domain. Our data indicate that the two ARNT/TACC3 inhibitors, KG-548 and KG-655, bind to a \u03b2-sheet surface implicated in both HIF-2 dimerization and coactivator recruitment. Furthermore, while KG-548 binds exclusively to the \u03b2-sheet surface, KG-655 can additionally bind within a water-accessible internal cavity in ARNT PAS-B. Finally, KG-279, while not a coactivator inhibitor, exemplifies ligands that preferentially bind only to the internal cavity. All three ligands promoted ARNT PAS-B homodimerization, albeit to varying degrees. Taken together, our findings provide a comprehensive overview of ARNT PAS-B ligand-binding sites and may guide the development of more potent coactivator inhibitors for cellular and functional studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xingjian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Closson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leandro Pimentel", "Last Name": "Marcelino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Denize C", "Last Name": "Favaro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marion L", "Last Name": "Silvestrini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Solazzo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lillian T", "Last Name": "Chong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun08"}, {"PMID": "37732199", "Title": "Signal-regulated unmasking of the nuclear localization motif in the PAS domain regulates the nuclear translocation of PASK.", "Abstract": "The ligand-regulated PAS domains are one of the most diverse signal-integrating domains found in proteins from prokaryotes to humans.

We find that organoid lines established from genetically-engineered mice 7 recapitulate key features of human CRPC-NE, and can display transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states in culture. CRPC-NE organoids express elevated levels of NSD2 and H3K36me2 marks, but relatively low levels of H3K27me3, consistent with antagonism of EZH2 activity by H3K36me2. Human CRPC-NE but not primary NEPC tumors expresses high levels of NSD2, consistent with a key role for NSD2 in lineage plasticity, and high NSD2 expression in mCRPC correlates with poor survival outcomes. Notably, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of NSD2 or expression of a dominant-negative oncohistone H3.3K36M mutant results in loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes and restores responsiveness to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide in mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids and grafts.

Here, we examine this linkage in histidine kinases (HKs), a large class of widely distributed prokaryotic environmental sensors. While the majority of HKs are transmembrane homodimers, members of the HWE/HisKA2 family can deviate from this architecture as exemplified by our finding of a monomeric soluble HWE/HisKA2 HK (EL346, a photosensing light-oxygen-voltage [LOV]-HK). To further explore the diversity of oligomerization states and regulation within this family, we biophysically and biochemically characterized multiple EL346 homologs and found a range of HK oligomeric states and functions. Three LOV-HK homologs are primarily dimeric with differing structural and functional responses to light, while two Per-ARNT-Sim-HKs interconvert between differentially active monomers and dimers, suggesting dimerization might control enzymatic activity for these proteins. Finally, we examined putative interfaces in a dimeric LOV-HK, finding that multiple regions contribute to dimerization.

In this report, we applied the nanostring immune panel to identify differences in inflammatory and immune gene expression by race. We observed a higher expression of multiple cytokines in AA patients compared to EA patients, with high expression of CD47, TGFB1, and NFKB1 associated with the transcriptional repressor Kaiso. To investigate the mechanism associated with this expression pattern, we observed that Kaiso depletion results in decreased expression of CD47, and its ligand SIRPA. Furthermore, Kaiso appears to directly bind to the methylated sequences of the THBS1 promotor and repress gene expression. Similarly, Kaiso depletion attenuated tumor formation in athymic nude mice, and these Kaiso-depleted xenograft tissues showed significantly higher phagocytosis and increased infiltration of M1 macrophages. In vitro validation using MCF7 and THP1 macrophages treated with Kaiso-depleted exosomes showed a reduced expression of immune-related markers (CD47 and SIRPA) and macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype compared to MCF7 cells treated with exosomes isolated from high-Kaiso cells.

Previously, we investigated the mRNA/miRNA role on PCa development and progression using high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Here our main goal was to investigate the effect of HFD on the expression of PCa-related miRNAs and their relevance in PCa patients. We identified 6 up- and 18 down-regulated miRNAs in TRAMP-C1 mice prostate tumors under HFD conditions using miRNA microarrays. Three down-regulated miRNAs: mmu-miR-133a-3p, -1a-3p and -29c-3p were validated in TRAMP-C1 mice prostate tumor by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Hsa-miR-133a-3p/1-3p expression levels were significantly decreased in PCa compared to normal tissues while hsa-miR-133a-3p was found to be further decreased in metastatic prostate cancer tumors compared to non-metastatic PCa. We examined the promoter region of hsa-miR-133a-3p/1-3p genes and compared methylation at these loci with mature miRNA expression. We found that hsa-miR-1-2/miR-133a-1 cluster promoter hypermethylation decreased hsa-miR-133a-3p/1-3p expression in PCa. GOLPH3 and JUP, two hsa-miR-133a-3p and miR-1-3p predicted target genes, were up-regulated in PCa. ROC analysis showed that the combination of hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP is a promising panel biomarker to distinguish between PCa and normal adjacent tissue (NAT). These results link PCa aggressiveness to the attenuation of hsa-miR-133a-3p and miR-1-3p expression by promoter hypermethylation.

Using an epitope-validated antibody against the endoplasmic reticulum-associated E3 ligase, gp78, we show that elevated levels of gp78 in patient breast cancer cells predict poor survival. Moreover, high levels of gp78 are associated with poor outcomes in both ER+ and ER- tumors, and breast cancers expressing elevated amounts of gp78 protein are enriched in gene expression pathways that influence cell cycle, metabolism, receptor-mediated signaling, and cell stress response pathways. In multivariate analysis adjusted for subtype and grade, gp78 protein is an independent predictor of poor outcomes in women of African ancestry. Furthermore, gene expression signatures, derived from patients stratified by gp78 protein expression, are strong predictors of recurrence and pathological complete response in retrospective clinical trial data and share many common features with gene sets previously identified to be overrepresented in breast cancers based on race.

To understand the molecular processes underlying arsenic exposure and the risk of disease development, this study investigated the functional relationship between high arsenic exposure and disease risk using gene expression derived from human exposure. In this study, a three step analysis was employed: (1) the gene expression profiles obtained from two diverse arsenic-exposed Asian populations were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes associated with arsenic exposure in human subjects, (2) the gene expression profiles induced by arsenic exposure in four different myeloma cancer cell lines were used to define common genes and pathways altered by arsenic exposure, and (3) the genetic profiles of two publicly available human bladder cancer studies were used to test the significance of the common association of genes, identified in step 1 and step 2, to develop and validate a predictive model of primary bladder cancer risk associated with arsenic exposure. Our analysis shows that arsenic exposure to humans is mainly associated with organismal injury and abnormalities, immunological disease, inflammatory disease, gastrointestinal disease, and increased rates of a wide variety of cancers. In addition, arsenic exerts its toxicity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increasing ROS production causing the imbalance that leads to cell and tissue damage (oxidative stress). Oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways leading to transformation of a normal cell to tumor cell specifically; there is significant evidence of the advancing changes in oxidative/nitrative stress during the progression of bladder cancer. Therefore, we examined the relation of differentially expressed genes due to exposure of arsenic in human and bladder cancer and developed a bladder cancer risk prediction model. In this study, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was one of the most significant pathways identified between both arsenic exposed population which plays a key role in eliciting a protective response to oxidative damage in epidermal cells. On the other hand, several studies showed that arsenic trioxide (ATO) is useful for anticancer therapy although the mechanisms underlying its paradoxical effects are still not well understood. ATO has shown remarkable efficacy for the treatment of multiple myeloma; therefore, it will be helpful to understand the underlying cancer biology by which ATO exerts its inhibitory effect on the myeloma cells. Our study found that MAPK is one of the most active network between arsenic gene and ATO cell line which is involved in indicative of oxidative/nitrosative damage and well associated with the development of bladder cancer. The study identified a unique set of 147 genes associated with arsenic exposure and linked to molecular mechanisms of cancer. The risk prediction model shows the highest prediction ability for recurrent bladder tumors based on a very small subset (NKIRAS2, AKTIP, and HLA-DQA1) of the 147 genes resulting in AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.744-0.995) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.343-0.933) on training and validation data, respectively.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Arsenic", "Asian People", "Humans", "Transcriptome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sonalika", "Last Name": "Singhal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of North Dakota, ND, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathan A", "Last Name": "Ruprecht", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of North Dakota, ND, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Sens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of North Dakota, ND, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kouhyar", "Last Name": "Tavakolian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of North Dakota, ND, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin L", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irvine Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandeep K", "Last Name": "Singhal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of North Dakota, ND, USA."}], "Journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "34978789", "Title": "Designing Single-Component Optogenetic Membrane Recruitment Systems: The Rho-Family GTPase Signaling Toolbox.", "Abstract": "We describe the efficient creation of single-component optogenetic tools for membrane recruitment-based signaling perturbation using BcLOV4 technology.

The reliability of this streamlined approach is demonstrated by the creation of an optogenetic Cdc42 GTPase and Rac1-activating Tiam1 GEF protein, which together with our other recently reported technologies, completes a toolbox for spatiotemporally precise induction of Rho-family GTPase signaling at the GEF or GTPase level, for driving filopodial protrusions, lamellipodial protrusions, and cell contractility, respectively mediated by Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA.", "Keywords": ["BcLOV4", "Cdc42", "Rho GTPase", "Tiam1", "optogenetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Optogenetics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Signal Transduction", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein", "rho GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erin E", "Last Name": "Berlew", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Keisuke", "Last Name": "Yamada", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ivan A", "Last Name": "Kuznetsov", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eleanor A", "Last Name": "Rand", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chandler C", "Last Name": "Ochs", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zaynab", "Last Name": "Jaber", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brian Y", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS synthetic biology", "PubDate": "2022Jan21"}, {"PMID": "34681793", "Title": "MiR-106b-5p: A Master Regulator of Potential Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Aggressiveness and Prognosis.", "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BCa) is the leading cause of death by cancer in women worldwide.

Early diagnosis and metastases detection are crucial features to diminish patient mortality. High fat diet (HFD) and metabolic syndrome increase PCa risk and aggressiveness. Our goal was to identify miRNAs-based biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and prognosis associated with HFD. Mice chronically fed with a HFD or control diet (CD) were subcutaneously inoculated with androgen insensitive PC3 cells. Xenografts from HFD-fed mice showed increased expression of 7 miRNAs that we named \"candidates\" compared to CD-fed mice. These miRNAs modulate specific metabolic and cancer related pathways. Using bioinformatic tools and human datasets we found that hsa-miR-19b-3p and miR-101-3p showed more than 1,100 validated targets involved in proteoglycans in cancer and fatty acid biosynthesis. These miRNAs were significantly increased in the bloodstream of PCa patients compared to non-PCa volunteers, and in prostate tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues (NAT). Interestingly, both miRNAs were also increased in tumors of metastatic patients compared to tumors of non-metastatic patients. Further receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined that hsa-miR-19b-3p and hsa-miR-101-3p in serum showed poor predictive power to discriminate PCa from non-PCa patients. Hsa-miR-19b-3p showed the best score to discriminate between tumor and NAT, while hsa-miR-101-3p was useful to differentiate between metastatic and non-metastatic PCa patients. Hsa-miR-101-3p was increased in exosomes isolated from blood of PCa patients.

While much is known about the structure and photochemistry of the light-perceiving LOV domains, particularly in how activation of the LOV2 domain triggers the unfolding of alpha helices that communicate the light signal to the kinase domain, many questions about phot structure and mechanism remain. Recent studies have made progress addressing these questions by utilizing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and other biophysical approaches to study multidomain phots from Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis, leading to models where the domains have an extended linear arrangement, with the regulatory LOV2 domain contacting the kinase domain N-lobe.

By using light as the inducing agent, the TAEL/C120 system overcomes limitations of traditional inducible expression systems by enabling fine spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. In this study, we describe ongoing efforts to improve the TAEL/C120 system.

We demonstrate that TAEL 2.0 consistently induces higher levels of reporter gene expression and at a faster rate, but with comparable background and toxicity as the original TAEL system. With these improvements, we were able to create functional stable transgenic lines to express the TAEL 2.0 transcription factor either ubiquitously or with a tissue-specific promoter.

Using high-pressure biomolecular NMR approaches, we obtained the first, to our knowledge, quantitative data testing two key hypotheses of this process: the slipped conformation is both smaller and less compressible than the wild-type equivalent, and the interconversion proceeds through a chiefly unfolded intermediate state. Data collected in steady-state pressure and time-resolved pressure-jump modes, including observed pressure-dependent changes in the populations of the two conformers and increased rate of interconversion between conformers, support both hypotheses.

We have previously described how a single point mutation can enable a well-folded protein domain, one of the two PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) domains of the human ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) protein, to interconvert between two conformers related by a slip of an internal \u03b2-strand. Using this protein as a test case, we advance the concept of a \"fragile fold,\" a protein fold that can reversibly rearrange into another fold that differs by a substantial number of hydrogen bonds, entailing reorganization of single secondary structure elements to more drastic changes seen in metamorphic proteins. Here we use a battery of biophysical tests to examine several factors affecting the equilibrium between the two conformations of the switching ARNT PAS-B Y456T protein. Of note, we find that factors which impact the HI loop preceding the shifted I\u03b2-strand affect both the equilibrium levels of the two conformers and the denatured state which links them in the interconversion process. Finally, we describe small molecules that selectively bind to and stabilize the wildtype conformation of ARNT PAS-B.

Although these domains have now been deployed in numerous systems, the precise mechanism of photoactivation and the accompanying structural dynamics that modulate output domain activity remain to be fully elucidated. In the C-terminal light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain of plant phototropins (LOV2), blue light activation leads to formation of an adduct between a conserved Cys residue and the embedded FMN chromophore, rotation of a conserved Gln (Q513), and unfolding of a helix (J\u03b1-helix) which is coupled to the output domain. In the present work, we focus on the allosteric pathways leading to J\u03b1 helix unfolding in Avena sativa LOV2 (AsLOV2) using an interdisciplinary approach involving molecular dynamics simulations extending to 7 \u03bcs, time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, solution NMR spectroscopy, and in-cell optogenetic experiments. In the dark state, the side chain of N414 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone N-H of Q513. The simulations predict a lever-like motion of Q513 after Cys adduct formation resulting in a loss of the interaction between the side chain of N414 and the backbone C\u2550O of Q513, and formation of a transient hydrogen bond between the Q513 and N414 side chains. The central role of N414 in signal transduction was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis supporting a direct link between J\u03b1 helix unfolding dynamics and the cellular function of the Zdk2-AsLOV2 optogenetic construct. Through this multifaceted approach, we show that Q513 and N414 are critical mediators of protein structural dynamics, linking the ultrafast (sub-ps) excitation of the FMN chromophore to the microsecond conformational changes that result in photoreceptor activation and biological function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Avena", "Flavin Mononucleotide", "Glutamine", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Light", "Membrane Proteins", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Mutation", "Optogenetics", "Phototropins", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Unfolding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James N", "Last Name": "Iuliano", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jinnette Tolentino", "Last Name": "Collado", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Agnieszka A", "Last Name": "Gil", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pavithran T", "Last Name": "Ravindran", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andras", "Last Name": "Lukacs", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "SeungYoun", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Helena A", "Last Name": "Woroniecka", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Katrin", "Last Name": "Adamczyk", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Aramini", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, 85 St. Nicholas Terrace, New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Uthama R", "Last Name": "Edupuganti", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, 85 St. Nicholas Terrace, New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher R", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Gregory M", "Last Name": "Greetham", "Affiliation": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, OX11 0QX, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Igor V", "Last Name": "Sazanovich", "Affiliation": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, OX11 0QX, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Ian P", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, OX11 0QX, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Taraneh", "Last Name": "Daryaee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jared E", "Last Name": "Toettcher", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jarrod B", "Last Name": "French", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, 85 St. Nicholas Terrace, New York, New York 10031, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carlos L", "Last Name": "Simmerling", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Meech", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "Tonge", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York, 11794, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2020Oct16"}, {"PMID": "32875710", "Title": "Adipose tissue from metabolic syndrome mice induces an aberrant miRNA signature highly relevant in prostate cancer development.", "Abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains an important public health concern in Western countries. Metabolic syndrome (MeS) is a cluster of pathophysiological disorders with increasing prevalence in the general population that is a risk factor for PCa. Several studies have determined that a crosstalk between white adipose tissue (WAT) and solid tumors favors cancer aggressiveness. In this work, our main goal was to investigate the interaction between WAT and PCa cells through microRNAs (miRNAs), in MeS mice. We developed a MeS-like disease model using C57BL/6J mice chronically fed with high-fat diet (HFD) that were inoculated with TRAMP-C1 PCa cells. A group of five miRNAs (mmu-miR-221-3p, 27a-3p, 34a-5p, 138-5p, and 146a-5p) were increased in gonadal WAT (gWAT), tumors, and plasma of MeS mice compared to control animals. Three of these five miRNAs were detected in the media from gWAT and TRAMP-C1 cell cocultures, and significantly increased in MeS context. More importantly, hsa-miR-221-3p, 146a-5p, and 27a-3p were increased in bloodstream of PCa patients compared to healthy donors. Using miRNA microarrays, we found that 121 miRNAs were differentially released to the coculture media between HFD-gWAT and tumor cells compared to control diet-gWAT and tumor cells. Target genes for the 66 most deregulated miRNAs were involved in common pathways, mainly related to fatty acid metabolism, ER protein processing, amino acid degradation, PI3K AKT signaling, and PCa. Our findings show for the first time a signature of five miRNAs as important players involved in the interaction between WAT and PCa in MeS mice. Further research will be necessary to track these miRNAs in the interaction between these tissues as well as their role in PCa patients with MeS.", "Keywords": ["adipose tissue", "metabolic syndrome",

"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are molecularly heterogeneous, and the link between their aggressiveness with African ancestry is not established. We investigated primary TNBCs for gene expression among self-reported race (SRR) groups of African American (AA, n = 42) and European American (EA, n = 33) women. RNA sequencing data were analyzed to measure changes in genome-wide expression, and we utilized logistic regressions to identify ancestry-associated gene expression signatures. Using SNVs identified from our RNA sequencing data, global ancestry was estimated. We identified 156 African ancestry-associated genes and found that, compared to SRR, quantitative genetic analysis was a more robust method to identify racial/ethnic-specific genes that were differentially expressed. A subset of African ancestry-specific genes that were upregulated in TNBCs of our AA patients were validated in TCGA data. In AA patients, there was a higher incidence of basal-like two tumors and altered TP53, NFB1, and AKT pathways. The distinct distribution of TNBC subtypes and altered oncologic pathways show that the ethnic variations in TNBCs are driven by shared genetic ancestry. Thus, to appreciate the molecular diversity of TNBCs, tumors from patients of various ancestral origins should be evaluated.", "Keywords": ["African ancestry", "RNAseq analysis", "disparities", "oncologic pathways", "triple negative breast cancer"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Martini", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Newman", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Elemento", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Center for Cancer Research, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088, USA."}, {"First Name": "Akanksha", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Indrani", "Last Name": "Datta", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Indra", "Last Name": "Adrianto", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yalei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hyung-Gyoon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA."}, {"First Name": "Windy D", "Last Name": "Colomb", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Center for Cancer Research, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isam-Eldin", "Last Name": "Eltoum", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andra R", "Last Name": "Frost", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA."}, {"First Name": "William E", "Last Name": "Grizzle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Sboner", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Upender", "Last Name": "Manne", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clayton", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Center for Cancer Research, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088, USA."}], "Journal": "Cancers", "PubDate": "2020May13"}, {"PMID": "31911546", "Title": "Racial Differences in the Association Between Luminal Master Regulator Gene Expression Levels and Breast Cancer Survival.", "Abstract": "Compared with their European American (EA) counterparts, African American (AA) women are more likely to die from breast cancer in the United States.

A hybrid system that combines centralized water infrastructure and household decentralized water facilities, including rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, may be a solution to more sustainable and resilient water management in urban areas. Understanding household and community preferences for decentralized water facilities is important to inform the design and ultimately the promotion and adoption of such systems. In this study, we conducted a discrete choice experiment, via Amazon Mechanical Turk, to collect data on household choices of different decentralized water facility designs in two U.S. cities, Atlanta, Georgia and Boston, Massachusetts. Based on the responses to the choice experiment, we then developed a latent-class choice model to predict households' preferences of decentralized system design features and examine the influence of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on heterogeneous class membership. We identified six major classes of preferences in Atlanta and Boston, respectively, and evaluated how readily each class is likely to choose a decentralized water facility. Atlanta and Boston have some classes sharing similar preferences for decentralized water systems, but the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of these classes in the two cities are different. We found that the early adoption of decentralized water facilities is positively related to neighbors' adoptions and pressure of water scarcity increases households' willingness to share a decentralized facility. The visualization of spatial distribution of the classes highlighted early demand of decentralized water facilities is likely to emerge in low-property-value communities, which creates a unique opportunity for introducing decentralized water facilities during water infrastructure renovations. Our study provides a framework through citizen engagement to understand social demand and to inform the promotion of decentralized water facilities.", "Keywords": ["Decentralization", "Discrete choice experiment", "Grey water recycling", "Latent-class choice modeling", "Rainwater harvesting", "Urban water infrastructure"], "MeSH terms": ["Boston", "Cities", "Georgia", "Massachusetts", "Water", "Water Supply"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhongming", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China."}, {"First Name": "Weiwei", "Last Name": "Mo", "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA.

Its association with poor survival in several cancers implicates CtBP as a promising target for pharmacological intervention. We employed computer-assisted drug design to search for CtBP inhibitors, using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and docking. Functional screening of these drugs identified 4 compounds with low toxicity and high water solubility. Micro molar concentrations of these CtBP inhibitors produces significant de-repression of epigenetically silenced pro-epithelial genes, preferentially in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. This epigenetic reprogramming occurs through eviction of CtBP from gene promoters; disrupted recruitment of chromatin-modifying protein complexes containing LSD1, and HDAC1; and re-wiring of activating histone marks at targeted genes. In functional assays, CtBP inhibition disrupts CtBP dimerization, decreases cell migration, abolishes cellular invasion, and improves DNA repair. Combinatorial use of CtBP inhibitors with the LSD1 inhibitor pargyline has synergistic influence. Finally, integrated correlation of gene expression in breast cancer patients with nuclear levels of CtBP1 and LSD1, reveals new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Metabolic syndrome (MeS) is a pathophysiological disorder that increases PCa risk and aggressiveness. C-terminal binding protein (CTBP1) is a transcriptional corepressor that is activated by high-fat diet (HFD). Previously, our group established a MeS/PCa mice model that identified CTBP1 as a novel link associating both diseases. Here, we integrated in vitro (prostate tumor cell lines) and in vivo (MeS/PCa NSG mice) models with molecular and cell biology techniques to investigate MeS/CTBP1 impact over PCa progression, particularly over cell adhesion, mRNA/miRNA expression and PCa spontaneous metastasis development. We found that CTBP1/MeS regulated expression of genes relevant to cell adhesion and PCa progression, such as cadherins, integrins, connexins, and miRNAs in PC3 xenografts. CTBP1 diminished PCa cell adhesion, membrane attachment to substrate and increased filopodia number by modulating gene expression to favor a mesenchymal phenotype.

from the monomeric blue light sensor EL346.", "Abstract": "Translation of environmental cues into cellular behavior is a necessary process in all forms of life. In bacteria, this process frequently involves two-component systems in which a sensor histidine kinase (HK) autophosphorylates in response to a stimulus before subsequently transferring the phosphoryl group to a response regulator that controls downstream effectors. Many details of the molecular mechanisms of HK activation are still unclear due to complications associated with the multiple signaling states of these large, multidomain proteins. To address these challenges, we combined complementary solution biophysical approaches to examine the conformational changes upon activation of a minimal, blue-light-sensing histidine kinase from Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, EL346. Our data show that multiple conformations coexist in the dark state of EL346 in solution, which may explain the enzyme's residual dark-state activity. We also observe that activation involves destabilization of the helices in the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer-like domain, where the phosphoacceptor histidine resides, and their interactions with the catalytic domain. Similar light-induced changes occur to some extent even in constitutively active or inactive mutants, showing that light sensing can be decoupled from activation of kinase activity. These structural changes mirror those inferred by comparing X-ray crystal structures of inactive and active HK fragments, suggesting that they are at the core of conformational changes leading to HK activation. More broadly, our findings uncover surprising complexity in this simple system and allow us to outline a mechanism of the multiple steps of HK activation.", "Keywords": ["ESR spectroscopy", "HDX-MS", "photoreceptor", "sensor histidine kinase", "two-component system"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Diphosphate", "Darkness", "Enzyme Activation", "Histidine Kinase", "Light", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Domains", "Protein Stability", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Dikiy", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, NY 10031."}, {"First Name": "Uthama R", "Last Name": "Edupuganti", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, NY 10031."}, {"First Name": "Rinat R", "Last Name": "Abzalimov", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, NY 10031."}, {"First Name": "Peter P", "Last Name": "Borbat", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853."}, {"First Name": "Madhur", "Last Name": "Srivastava", "Affiliation": "National Biomedical Center for Advanced ESR Technology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853."}, {"First Name": "Jack H", "Last Name": "Freed", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853."}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Initiative, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, New York, NY 10031; kevin.gardner@asrc.cuny.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2019Mar12"}, {"PMID": "30611431", "Title": "Isotopic Labeling of Eukaryotic Membrane Proteins for NMR Studies of Interactions and Dynamics.", "Abstract": "Membrane proteins, and especially G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), are increasingly important targets of structural biology studies due to their involvement in many biomedically critical pathways in humans.

Most cancer patients die of metastatic disease. EMT is proposed to be the initial event associated with cancer metastasis and how it occurred is still a mystery. CtBP is known as a co-repressor abundantly expressed in many types of cancer and regulates genes involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. We found that CtBP regulates intracellular cholesterol homeostasis in breast cancer cells by forming a complex with ZEB1 and transcriptionally repressing SREBF2 expression. Importantly, CtBP repression of intracellular cholesterol abundance leads to increased EMT and cell migration. The reason is that cholesterol negatively regulates the stability of TGF-\u03b2 receptors on the cell membrane. Interestingly, TGF-\u03b2 is also capable of reducing intracellular cholesterol relying on the increased recruitment of ZEB1 and CtBP complex to SREBF2 promoter. Thus, we propose a feedback loop formed by CtBP, cholesterol, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, through which TGF-\u03b2 triggers the cascade that mobilizes the cancer cells for metastasis. Consistently, the intravenous injection of breast cancer cells with ectopically CtBP expression show increased lung metastasis depending on the reduction of intracellular cholesterol. Finally, we analyzed the public breast cancer datasets and found that CtBP expression negatively correlates with SREBF2 and HMGCR expressions. High expression of CtBP and low expression of SREBF2 and HMGCR significantly correlates with high EMT of the primary tumors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Movement", "Cholesterol", "Co-Repressor Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Feedback, Physiological", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2", "Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhiqiang", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Dapeng", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Peipei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Haisheng", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li-Jun", "Last Name": "Di", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China. lijundi@um.edu.mo."}], "Journal": "Oncogene", "PubDate": "2019Mar"}, {"PMID": "30397124", "Title": "A multiscale approach to balance trade-offs among dam infrastructure, river restoration, and cost.", "Abstract": "Aging infrastructure and growing interests in river restoration have led to a substantial rise in dam removals in the United States.

C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1) is a transcriptional co-repressor of tumor suppressor genes that is activated by low NAD+ /NADH ratio. Previously, our group established a MeS and PCa mice model that identified CTBP1 as a novel link associating both diseases. We found that CTBP1 controls the transcription of aromatase (CYP19A1), a key enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism that explains CTBP1 as a link between MeS and PCa based on CYP19A1 and estrogen synthesis regulation using PCa cell lines, MeS/PCa mice and adipose co-culture systems. We found that CTBP1 and E1A binding protein p300 (EP300) bind to CYP19A1 promoter and downregulate its expression in PC3 cells. Estradiol, through estrogen receptor beta, released CTBP1 from CYP19A1 promoter triggering its transcription and modulating PCa cell proliferation. We generated NSG and C57BL/6J MeS mice by chronically feeding animals with high fat diet. In the NSG model, CTBP1 depleted PCa xenografts showed an increase in CYP19A1 expression with subsequent increment in intratumor estradiol concentrations.

These relationships were then used to project changes in embodied energy associated with the plants' processes, and the results were compared between the two regions. The projections of the southeastern US water plant were for an increase in energy demand resulted from an increase of treatment chemical usages.

In this work, our aim was to elucidate the role of CTBP1 and MeS in BrCa metastasis. We found that CTBP1 protein diminished adhesion while increased migration of triple negative BrCa cells. CTBP1 and MeS modulated the expression of multiple genes (ITGB4, ITGB6, PRSS2, COL17A1 and FABP4) and miRNAs (miR-378a-3p, miR-146a-5p, let-7e-3p, miR-381-5p, miR-194-5p, miR-494-3p) involved in BrCa progression of MDA-MB-231-derived xenografts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MeS increased lung micrometastasis and liver neoplastic disease in mice.

Metabolic syndrome (MeS) is associated with increased PCa aggressiveness and recurrence. Previously, we proposed C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1), a transcriptional co-repressor, as a molecular link between these two conditions. Notably, CTBP1 depletion decreased PCa growth in MeS mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that explain the link between MeS and PCa mediated by CTBP1. We found that CTBP1 repressed chloride channel accessory 2 (CLCA2) expression in prostate xenografts developed in MeS animals. CTBP1 bound to CLCA2 promoter and repressed its transcription and promoter activity in PCa cell lines. Furthermore, we found that CTBP1 formed a repressor complex with ZEB1, EP300 and HDACs that modulates the CLCA2 promoter activity. CLCA2 promoted PCa cell adhesion inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activating CTNNB1 together with epithelial marker (CDH1) induction, and mesenchymal markers (SNAI2 and TWIST1) repression. Moreover, CLCA2 depletion in PCa cells injected subcutaneously in MeS mice increased the circulating tumor cells foci compared to control. A microRNA (miRNA) expression microarray from PCa xenografts developed in MeS mice, showed 21 miRNAs modulated by CTBP1 involved in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, focal adhesion and adherents junctions, among others. We found that miR-196b-5p directly targets CLCA2 by cloning CLCA2 3'UTR and performing reporter assays.

Because no other gene is mutated as frequently in ccRCC and VHL mutations are truncal, VHL inactivation is regarded as the governing event. VHL loss activates the HIF-2 transcription factor, and constitutive HIF-2 activity restores tumorigenesis in VHL-reconstituted ccRCC cells. HIF-2 has been implicated in angiogenesis and multiple other processes, but angiogenesis is the main target of drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. HIF-2 has been regarded as undruggable. Here we use a tumourgraft/patient-derived xenograft platform to evaluate PT2399, a selective HIF-2 antagonist that was identified using a structure-based design approach. PT2399 dissociated HIF-2 (an obligatory heterodimer of HIF-2\u03b1-HIF-1\u03b2) in human ccRCC cells and suppressed tumorigenesis in 56% (10 out of 18) of such lines. PT2399 had greater activity than sunitinib, was active in sunitinib-progressing tumours, and was better tolerated. Unexpectedly, some VHL-mutant ccRCCs were resistant to PT2399. Resistance occurred despite HIF-2 dissociation in tumours and evidence of Hif-2 inhibition in the mouse, as determined by suppression of circulating erythropoietin, a HIF-2 target and possible pharmacodynamic marker. We identified a HIF-2-dependent gene signature in sensitive tumours. Gene expression was largely unaffected by PT2399 in resistant tumours, illustrating the specificity of the drug. Sensitive tumours exhibited a distinguishing gene expression signature and generally higher levels of HIF-2\u03b1. Prolonged PT2399 treatment led to resistance. We identified binding site and second site suppressor mutations in HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2, respectively. Both mutations preserved HIF-2 dimers despite treatment with PT2399. Finally, an extensively pretreated patient whose tumour had given rise to a sensitive tumourgraft showed disease control for more than 11 months when treated with a close analogue of PT2399, PT2385. We validate HIF-2 as a target in ccRCC, show that some ccRCCs are HIF-2 independent, and set the stage for biomarker-driven clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aryl

Such cavities are uncommon except in the case of ligand-binding proteins, leading to the hypothesis that HIF-2\u03b1 can be regulated by small molecules. The development of artificial HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitors validates this hypothesis but raises questions about the impact of this cavity on HIF-2\u03b1 PAS-B structure and function. To answer these points, we used computational methods to construct a repacked protein containing a smaller cavity within the native fold. Experimental validation of a five-mutation variant confirms achieving these objectives and stabilizing the folded structure. Complementary functional data establish that ligands cannot bind this variant although heterodimerization remains unchanged.

C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) is a co-repressor of tumor suppressor genes that is activated by low NAD+/NADH ratio. High fat diet (HFD) increases intracellular NADH. We investigated the effect of CtBP1 hyperactivation by HFD intake on mouse breast carcinogenesis. We generated a MeS-like disease in female mice by chronically feeding animals with HFD. MeS increased postnatal mammary gland development and generated prominent duct patterns with markedly increased CtBP1 and Cyclin D1 expression. CtBP1 induced breast cancer cells proliferation.

Photosensory inputs are transduced into signaling outputs via structural rearrangements in sensor domains that consequently modulate the activity of an effector domain or multidomain clusters. Establishing the diversity in effector function and sensor-effector topology will inform what signaling mechanisms govern light-responsive behaviors across multiple kingdoms of life and how these signals are transduced. Here, we report the bioinformatics identification of over 6,700 candidate LOV domains (including over 4,000 previously unidentified sequences from plants and protists), and insights from their annotations for ontological function and structural arrangements. Motif analysis identified the sensors from \u223c42 million ORFs, with strong statistical separation from other flavoproteins and non-LOV members of the structurally related Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim family. Conserved-domain analysis determined putative light-regulated function and multidomain topologies. We found that for certain effectors, sensor-effector linker length is discretized based on both phylogeny and the preservation of \u03b1-helical heptad repeats within an extended coiled-coil linker structure. This finding suggests that preserving sensor-effector orientation is a key determinant of linker length, in addition to ancestry, in LOV signaling structure-function. We found a surprisingly high prevalence of effectors with functions previously thought to be rare among LOV proteins, such as regulators of G protein signaling, and discovered several previously unidentified effectors, such as lipases.

While many biophysical methods may be used to obtain KD, the focus of this report is a relatively new method called microscale thermophoresis (MST). In an MST experiment, a capillary tube filled with a solution containing a dye-labeled solute is illuminated with an infrared laser, rapidly creating a temperature gradient. Molecules will migrate along this gradient, causing changes in the observed fluorescence. Because the net migration of the labeled molecules will depend on their liganded state, a binding curve as a function of ligand concentration can be constructed from MST data and analyzed to determine KD. Herein, simulations demonstrate the limits of KD that can be measured in current instrumentation. They also show that binding kinetics is a major concern in planning and executing MST experiments.

Studies of several prototypical REC domains suggest that phosphorylation shifts these proteins between inactive and active structures that are globally similar and well-folded. However, it is unclear how globally these findings hold within REC domains in general, particularly when they are considered within full-length proteins.

Size exclusion chromatography, light scattering, and solution NMR experiments show that EL_LovR is monomeric and unfolded in solution under conditions routinely used for other REC structure determinations. Addition of Mg(2+) and phosphorylation induce progressively greater degrees of tertiary structure stabilization, with the solution structure of the fully activated EL_LovR adopting the canonical receiver domain fold. Parallel functional assays show that EL_LovR has a fast dephosphorylation rate, consistent with its proposed function as a phosphate sink that depletes the HK phosphoryl group, promoting the phosphatase activity of this enzyme.

Using the wild-type and AQTrip EL222 proteins, we have probed EL222 activation using a combination of solution scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electromobility shift assays. Size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering indicate that AQTrip oligomerizes in the absence of DNA and selects for an EL222 dimer-DNA complex in the presence of DNA substrates. These results are confirmed in wild-type EL222 with a high-affinity DNA-binding site that stabilizes the complex.

Upon activation, these proteins autophosphorylate a histidine residue before subsequently transferring the phosphate to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of a cognate response regulator (RR). Such phosphorylation activates the output domain of the RR, leading to changes in gene expression, protein-protein interactions, or enzymatic activities. Here, we focus on one such light sensing LOV-HK from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594 (EL368), seeking to understand how kinase activity and subsequent downstream effects are regulated by light. We found that photoactivation of EL368 led to a significant enhancement in the incorporation of phosphate within the HK domain. Further enzymatic studies showed that the LOV domain affected both the LOV-HK turnover rate (kcat) and Km in a light-dependent manner. Using in vitro phosphotransfer profiling, we identified two target RRs for EL368 and two additional LOV-HKs (EL346 and EL362) encoded within the host genome. The two RRs include a PhyR-type transcriptional regulator (EL_PhyR) and a receiver-only protein (EL_LovR), reminiscent of stress-triggered systems in other bacteria.

Results indicate that the environmental burdens associated with CDDB and forest residue gasification may be similar to conventional electricity generation. Land occupation is lowest when CDDB is used. Environmental impacts are to a large extent due to coal cogasified, coke used as gasifier bed material, and fuel oil cocombusted in the steam boiler. However, uncertainties associated with preliminary system designs may be large, particularly the heat loss associated with pilot scale data resulting in overall low efficiencies of energy conversion to electricity; a sensitivity analysis assesses these uncertainties in further detail.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomass", "Construction Industry", "Electricity", "Gases", "New England", "Power Plants", "Trees"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Nuss", "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Group, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire 03824, United States. philip.nuss@unh.edu"}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jenna R", "Last Name": "Jambeck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Environmental science & technology", "PubDate": "2013Apr02"}, {"PMID": "23438473", "Title": "Wounds that will not heal: pervasive cellular reprogramming in cancer.", "Abstract": "There has been an explosion of articles on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other modes of cellular reprogramming that influence the tumor microenvironment. Many controversies exist and remain to be resolved. The interest of the pathologists in the molecular and functional parallels between wound healing and the developing tumor stroma has its earliest origin in the writings of Rudolph Virchow in the 19(th) century. Since then, most of the focus has been primarily on the dynamics of the extracellular matrix; however, new interest has been redirected toward deciphering and understanding the enigmatic, yet elegant, plasticity of the cellular components of the proliferating epithelia and stroma and how they are reciprocally influenced.

Though transcription factors are typically considered 'undruggable', the PAS-B domain of the HIF-2\u03b1 subunit contains a large cavity within its hydrophobic core that offers a unique foothold for small-molecule regulation. Here we identify artificial ligands that bind within this pocket and characterize the resulting structural and functional changes caused by binding. Notably, these ligands antagonize HIF-2 heterodimerization and DNA-binding activity in vitro and in cultured cells, reducing HIF-2 target gene expression. Despite the high sequence identity between HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b1, these ligands are highly selective and do not affect HIF-1 function.

These proteins contain flavin-binding LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domains that form covalent cysteine-flavin adducts upon exposure to blue light, leading to the enhancement of phototropin kinase activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that adduct formation in the phototropin LOV2 domains leads to the dissociation of an alpha helix (J\u03b1) from these domains as part of the light-induced activation process. However, crystal structures of LOV domains both in the presence and absence of the J\u03b1 helix show very few differences between dark and illuminated states, and thus the precise mechanism through which adduct formation triggers helical dissociation remains poorly understood. Using Avena sativa phototropin 1 LOV2 as a model system, we have studied the interactions of the LOV domain core with the J\u03b1 helix through a series of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Here we show that conformational transitions of a conserved glutamine residue in the flavin binding pocket are coupled to altered dynamics of the J\u03b1 helix both through a shift in dynamics of the main \u03b2-sheet of the LOV domain core and through a secondary pathway involving the N-terminal A'\u03b1 helix.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Avena", "Binding Sites", "Cluster Analysis", "Databases, Protein", "Dinitrocresols", "Glutamine", "Light", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Phototropins", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Freddolino", "Affiliation": "Joint Centers for Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin H", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Klaus", "Last Name": "Schulten", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23385593", "Title": "Genome-wide profiles of CtBP link metabolism with genome stability and epithelial reprogramming in breast cancer.", "Abstract": "The C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) is a NADH-dependent transcriptional repressor that links carbohydrate metabolism to epigenetic regulation by recruiting diverse histone-modifying complexes to chromatin. Here global profiling of CtBP in breast cancer cells reveals that it drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, stem cell pathways and genome instability. CtBP expression induces mesenchymal and stem cell-like features, whereas CtBP depletion or caloric restriction reverses gene repression and increases DNA repair. Multiple members of the CtBP-targeted gene network are selectively downregulated in aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Differential expression of CtBP-targeted genes predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, and elevated levels of CtBP in patient tumours predict shorter median survival. Finally, both CtBP promoter targeting and gene repression can be reversed by small molecule inhibition.

In one route, we used in vitro NMR and biochemical screening to identify small molecules that selectively bind within the ARNT PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) domain that recruits TACC3, identifying KG-548 as an ARNT/TACC3 disruptor. A parallel, cell-based screening approach previously implicated the small molecule KHS101 as an inhibitor of TACC3 signaling.
