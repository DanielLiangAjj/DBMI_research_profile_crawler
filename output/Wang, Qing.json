Herein, we report the design and synthesis of azaborahelicene corannulene 1 through hybridization of an azabora[5] helical structure and subsequent luminescence studies. Significant enhancement in chemiluminescence (CL), electroluminescence (ECL) and photoluminescence (PL) is achieved compared to those of pristine Cor. Specifically, hybrid 1 shows a notable augmentation in absolute luminescence quantum efficiencies: 25-fold for CL, up to 23-fold for ECL with BPO as a coreactant, and 30-fold for PL, respectively, compared to those of pristine Cor. Intriguingly, the blue light emission observed in all three luminescence types suggests the presence of a single excited state. As revealed by variable-temperature (VT) 1H NMR experiments, the bowl inversion frequency apparently decelerates by the steric effect of the helix motif in 1, which could contribute to the enhanced luminescent properties by reducing excited energy losses non-radiatively through fewer molecular motions; these enhanced luminescence observations could be categorized alongside the aggregation induced emission (AIE) and crystallization-induced emission (CIE) phenomena.

During the PCR amplification process, nonspecific pairing between the 3' end of the primer and the DNA sequence can cause cross-talk in the amplification reaction, leading to the generation of interfering sequences and reduced amplification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an efficient coding algorithm for PCR amplification information retrieval (ECA-PCRAIR). This algorithm employs variable-length scanning and pruning optimization to construct a codebook that maximizes storage density while satisfying traditional biological constraints. Subsequently, a codeword search tree is constructed based on the primer library to optimize the codebook, and a variable-length interleaver is used for constraint detection and correction, thereby minimizing the likelihood of nonspecific pairing. Experimental results demonstrate that ECA-PCRAIR can reduce the probability of nonspecific pairing between the 3' end of the primer and the DNA sequence to 2-25%, enhancing the robustness of the DNA sequences. Additionally, ECA-PCRAIR achieves a storage density of 2.14-3.67 bits per nucleotide (bits/nt), significantly improving storage capacity.", "Keywords": ["DNA coding", "DNA storage", "ECA-PCRAIR", "biological constraint", "nonspecific pairing constraint", "storage density"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "DNA", "Information Storage and Retrieval", "DNA Primers", "Base Sequence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}, {"First Name": "Shufang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jun11"}, {"PMID": "38926933", "Title": "In vivo evaluation of T-Scan in quantifying occlusal contact.", "Abstract": "The T-scan system has been used previously to analyse occlusion, but the quantitative analysis of occlusal contact by T-Scan system has yet to be reported.", "Keywords": ["T\u2010Scan occlusal analysis method", "occlusal contact area", "occlusal contact number", "reliability", "silicone transmission analysis method", "validity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jiale", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ruifeng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Digital Dentistry Center, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shizhu", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Digital Dentistry Center, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Chufan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Air Force Medical Center, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Fu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."}], "Journal": "Journal of oral rehabilitation", "PubDate": "2024Jun26"}, {"PMID": "38925633", "Title": "Atomic Force Microscopy Lifetime Analysis: An Intuitive Method for Evaluating Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Dimer-Targeting Inhibitors.", "Abstract": "Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or binding to ligands can lead to the formation of specific unliganded and liganded RTK dimers, and these two RTK dimers are potential targets for preventing tumor metastasis. Traditional RTK dimer inhibitor analysis was mostly based on end point assays, which required cumbersome cell handling and behavior monitoring. There are still challenges in developing intuitive process-based analytical methods to study RTK dimer inhibitors, especially those used to visually distinguish between unliganded and liganded RTK dimer inhibitors. Herein, taking the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) receptor, an intuitive method for evaluating MET inhibitors has been developed based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) lifetime analysis. The time interval between the start of the force and the bond break point was regarded as the bond lifetime, which could reflect the stability of the MET dimer. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the lifetime (\u03c4) of unliganded MET dimers (\u03c41 = 207.87 \u00b1 4.69 ms) and liganded MET dimers (\u03c42 = 330.58 \u00b1 15.60 ms) induced by the hepatocyte growth factor, and aptamer SL1 could decrease \u03c41 and \u03c42, suggesting that SL1 could inhibit both unliganded and liganded MET dimers. However, heparin only decreased \u03c42, suggesting that it could inhibit only the liganded MET dimer. AFM-based lifetime analysis methods could monitor RTK dimer status rather than provide overall average results, allowing for intuitive process-based analysis and evaluation of RTK dimers and related inhibitors at the single-molecule level.

This study aimed to elucidate the effect of FTO, a key regulator in m6A methylation in septic cardiomyopathy, and its potential therapeutic implications. Cellular and animal models of septic myocardial injury were established. Moreover, it was revealed that ferroptosis, which is a form of programmed necrosis occurring with iron dependence, was activated within cardiomyocytes during septic conditions. The overexpression of FTO-suppressed ferroptosis alleviated heart inflammation and dysfunction and improved survival rates in vivo. However, the protective effects of FTO were attenuated by the overexpression of BACH1, which is a molecule negatively correlated with FTO. Mechanistically, FTO modulated the m6A modification of BACH1, suggesting a complex interplay in the regulation of cardiomyocyte damage and sepsis.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern-recognition transmembrane receptor that induces neuroinflammatory processes in response to injury. Tlr4 is highly expressed in ocular tissues and is known to modulate inflammatory processes in both anterior and posterior segment tissues. TLR4 activation can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic deficits in inflammatory disorders. Due to its effects on inflammation and metabolism, TLR4 is a candidate to participate in glaucoma pathogenesis. It has been suggested as a therapeutic target based on studies using acute models, such as experimentally raising IOP to ischemia-inducing levels. Nevertheless, its role in chronic glaucoma needs further evaluation. In the current study, we investigated the role of TLR4 in an inherited mouse model of chronic glaucoma, DBA/2J. To do this, we analyzed the effect of Tlr4 knockout (Tlr4 -/-) on glaucoma-associated phenotypes in DBA/2J mice. Our studies found no significant differences in intraocular pressure, iris disease, or glaucomatous progression in Tlr4 -/- compared to Tlr4 +/+ DBA/2J mice.

According to the findings of our investigation, WTAP was significantly elevated in HCC cells and was associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally, WTAP accelerated HCC immune evasion and aerobic glycolysis while suppressing the tumor-killing ability of CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, WTAP knockdown had the opposite effect. WTAP targets the m6A site on the 3'-UTR of PD-L1 mRNA, which mechanistically increases the stability of PD-L1 mRNA. These results showed that WTAP inhibited CD8+ T cells' antitumor activity, which in turn deteriorated HCC immune evasion and aerobic glycolysis.

The amounts of MPs found in the biodeposit of cultured oysters were 3.54 times greater than that in the natural deposition. The polymer types of biodeposit MPs also differed from those of natural deposition. It was estimated that a single oyster can deposit 15.88 MPs per day, which is a figure much higher than the initial results, and hotspots of MPs deposition may be formed within the oyster aquaculture area.

The above results suggest that cultured bivalves have an important capacity for MPs biodeposition and will further change the vertical distribution pattern of MPs in coastal environments.", "Keywords": ["Aquaculture", "Infrared chemical imaging system", "Plastic pollution", "Sediments", "Vertical flux"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Microplastics", "Water Pollutants, Chemical", "Crassostrea", "Aquaculture", "Environmental Monitoring", "Geologic Sediments", "Seawater"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiasen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jialin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaodan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Tianyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dongyu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Encui", "Last Name": "Shan", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China.

However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, we report a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4--based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox-mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN)6]3- in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH)4]2- in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH- during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrated exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs but can also be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen-induced parasitic reactions.

Moreover, the influence of ambient temperature and electrode distance on the pyro-phototronic effect was well analyzed. Notably, the PSD exhibited remarkable stability even at ambient temperatures up to 150 \u00b0C. Despite the considerable working distance of 11 mm, the PS of the PSD remained at 128.99 mV/mm.

Compared to traditional methods such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, it has the ability to restore the patient's immune system, leading to long-term immune memory with less damage to normal tissues. However, immunotherapy has its limitations, including limited therapeutic efficacy, restricted patient populations, and inconsistent treatment responses. Finding effective immunotherapeutic approaches has become a key focus of its clinical application. The adenosine pathway is a recently discovered tumor immune regulatory signaling pathway. It can influence the metabolism and growth of tumor cells by acting through key enzymes in the adenosine pathway, thereby affecting the development of tumors. Therefore, inhibiting the adenosine pathway is an effective cancer immunotherapy. Common adenosine pathway inhibitors include small molecules and antibody proteins, and extensive preclinical trials have demonstrated their effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth. The short half-life, low bioavailability, and single administration route of adenosine pathway inhibitors limit their clinical application. With the advent of nanotechnology, nano-delivery of adenosine pathway inhibitors has addressed these issues. Compared to traditional drugs, nano-drugs extend the drug's circulation time and improve its distribution within the body. They also offer targeting capabilities and have low toxic side effects, making them very promising for future applications. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of the adenosine pathway in tumor immune suppression, the clinical applications of adenosine pathway inhibitors, and nano-delivery based on adenosine pathway inhibitors.

Using a comprehensive list of potential interactions mediated by receptors, ligands, ion channels and metabolites to generate injury-specific neuroimmune interactomes, we also uncovered that thrombospondin-1 upregulated by immune cells upon injury inhibited nociceptor sensitization.

Our previous study suggested that miR-451a may play a role in benzene-induced impairment of erythroid differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role of miR-451a and its underlying mechanisms in hydroquinone (HQ)-induced suppression of erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. 0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 50\u202f\u03bcM HQ treatment of K562 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of erythroid differentiation, as well as the expression of miR-451a. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict potential target genes of miR-451a and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-451a can directly bind to the 3'-UTR regions of BATF, SETD5, and ARHGEF3 mRNAs. We further demonstrated that over-expression or down-regulation of miR-451a altered the expression of BATF, SETD5, and ARHGEF3, and also modified erythroid differentiation. In addition, BATF, SETD5, and ARHGEF3 were verified to play a role in HQ-induced inhibition of erythroid differentiation in this study. Knockdown of SETD5 and ARHGEF3 reversed HQ-induced suppression of erythroid differentiation while knockdown of BATF had the opposite effect. On the other hand, we also identified c-Jun as a potential transcriptional regulator of miR-451a. Forced expression of c-Jun increased miR-451a expression and reversed the inhibition of erythroid differentiation induced by HQ, whereas knockdown of c-Jun had the opposite effect. And the binding site of c-Jun and miR-451a was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-451a and its downstream targets BATF, SETD5, and ARHGEF3 are involved in HQ-induced erythroid differentiation disorder, and c-Jun regulates miR-451a as a transcriptional regulator in this process.", "Keywords": ["Erythroid differentiation", "Hydroquinone", "K562 cells", "miR-451a"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "MicroRNAs", "Cell Differentiation", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "K562 Cells", "Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Erythroid Cells", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun", "Methyltransferases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanrong", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University,\u00a0Guangzhou 510080,\u00a0China;

Pyroptosis is an important immune defence mechanism of the body that plays a crucial role in clearing pathogen infections and endogenous danger signals. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of G. parasuis serotype 5 SQ (GPS5-SQ)-induced pyroptosis in swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs). The results of the present study demonstrated that GPS5-SQ infection induces pyroptosis in STECs by enhancing the protein level of the N-terminal domain of gasdermin D (GSDMD-N) and activating the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Furthermore, the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins, including GSDMD-N and cleaved caspase-1 were considerably decreased in STECs after the knockdown of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). These results indicated that GPS5-SQ might trigger pyroptosis through the activation of the RIG-I/MAVS/NLRP3 signaling pathway. More importantly, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) repressed the activation of the RIG-I/MAVS/NLRP3 signaling and rescued the decrease in Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) after GPS5-SQ infection. Overall, our findings show that GPS5-SQ can activate RIG-I/MAVS/NLRP3 signaling and destroy the integrity of the epithelial barrier by inducing ROS generation in STECs, shedding new light on G. parasuis pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["Glaesserella parasuis", "Inflammasomes", "Pyroptosis", "Swine tracheal epithelial cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Pyroptosis", "Epithelial Cells", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Swine", "Signal Transduction", "Haemophilus parasuis", "Trachea", "Swine Diseases", "Serogroup", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Inflammasomes", "DEAD Box Protein 58", "Haemophilus Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuhui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University,\u00a0Nanjing 210095,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Mengru", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University,\u00a0Nanjing 210095,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University,\u00a0Nanjing 210095,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Wenda", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Joint Research Center for Foodborne Functional Factors and Green Preparation, School of Food and Biological Engineering, Engineering Research Center of Bio-process, Ministry of Education, Hefei University of Technology,\u00a0Hefei 230009,\u00a0China.

In addition, our study revealed that ALKBH5-ZKSCAN3-VEGFA signaling was significantly activated during MNNG-induced gastric carcinogenesis, and further studies in gastric cancer patients showed that ALKBH5, ZKSCAN3, and VEGFA expression were upregulated in cancers compared with paired gastric mucosal tissues, that ALKBH5, ZKSCAN3, and VEGFA could serve as important biomarkers for determining patient prognosis, and that the molecular combination showed greater prognostic value. These findings provide a theoretical basis for developing gastric cancer interventions for NOCs and for determining gastric cancer progression.", "Keywords": ["Gastric cancer", "M6A", "MNNG", "Prognosis", "ZKSCAN3"], "MeSH terms": ["Stomach Neoplasms", "AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase", "Humans", "Animals", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Adenosine", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Methylnitronitrosoguanidine", "Cell Movement", "Disease Progression", "Mice, Nude", "Male", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Carcinogens", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Yefei", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Qinzhi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Longlong", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenglong", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyue", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China; Key Laboratory of Human Genetics and Environmental Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Weimin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Yixing Hospital Affiliated to Medical College of Yangzhou University, Yixing\u00a0214200, Jiangsu, China.

A molar ratio of 1 (Al3+):9 (F-) using HCl/LiF was employed to convert raw Ti3AlC2 (MAX phase) into MXene within 48\u00a0h at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. This procedure predominantly yielded monolayers distinguished by diameters exceeding 500\u00a0nm, elevated crystallinity and a high overall yield. Advanced characterization techniques, including FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, AFM, XPS, and FTIR, were utilized. Instrumental analysis confirmed the formation of MXene exhibiting a single-flake morphology with diameters exceeding 500\u00a0nm. These monolayers were intact and continuous, with smooth peripheries and a uniform thickness of 2.1\u00a0nm. The surfaces were predominantly composed of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and titanium (Ti) atoms, interconnected by chemical bonds such as C-Ti-O, C-Ti-OH, C-C, C-O, and Ti-O. In the subsequent phase, vacuum filtration facilitated the assembly of a self-supporting MXene membrane.

Unlike most conventional DNA isolation methods that rely on cell lysis to release bacterial DNA, DFs can trigger the oxidative stress response of bacterial cells to promote bacterial membrane vesicle formation and DNA release by generating reactive oxygen species in aqueous solutions. Due to the hierarchical porous structure, DFs provided high DNA capture efficiency exceeding 80% over a wide range of DNA amounts from 10 pg to 10 ng, making only 10 \u03bcg DFs sufficient for each test. Since laborious liquid handling steps are not required, the entire DNA sample preparation process using DFs can be completed within 3 min. The diagnostic use of this DF-based methodology was illustrated, which showed that the DNA of the pathogenic bacteria in serum samples was isolated by DFs and directly detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at concentrations as low as 102 CFU/mL, outperforming the most used approaches based on solid-phase DNA extraction. Furthermore, most of the bacterial cells were still alive after DNA isolation using DFs, providing the possibility of recycling samples for storage and further diagnosis.

This study designed two experiments (1) mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to 100 particles/L or 1,000 particles/L polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, 17.01 \u00b1 6.74 \u03bcm) MPs and 1 \u00d7 107 CFU/mL Vibrio parahaemolyticus at the same time (14 days), and (2) mussels were exposed to 100 particles/L or 1,000 particles/L MPs for a long time (30 days) and then exposed to 1 \u00d7 107 CFU/mL V. parahaemolyticus to explore the effects of these two stresses on the mussel immune system. The results showed that after the combined exposure of V. parahaemolyticus and MPs, the lysosomal membrane stability of hemocytes decreased, lysozyme activity was inhibited, and hemocytes were induced to produce more lectins and defensins to fight pathogenic invasion. Long-term exposure to MPs caused a large amount of energy consumption in mussels, inhibited most of the functions of humoral immunity, increased the risk of mussel infection with pathogenic bacteria, and negatively affected mussel condition factor, the number of hemocytes, and the number of byssuses. Mussels may allocate more energy to deal with MPs and pathogenic bacterial infections rather than for growth.

A recent report of a patient carrying a novel gain-of-function variant of RELN (H3447R, termed RELN-COLBOS) who developed resilience against presenilin-linked autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) has generated enormous interest. The RELN-COLBOS variant enhances interactions with the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which are associated with delayed AD onset and progression.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the potential immune response of macrophages in the brain of orange-spotted groupers (Epinephelus coioides) following red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. We observed that RGNNV induced macrophages to produce an inflammatory response in the brain of orange-spotted grouper, and the macrophages exhibited M1-type polarization after RGNNV infection. In addition, we found RGNNV-induced macrophage M1 polarization via the CXCR3.2- CXCL11 pathway.

However, a single sensor cannot meet the navigation requirements in different scenarios. This paper proposes a \"plug and play\" Vision/IMU/UWB multi-sensor tightly-coupled system based on factor graph. The difference from traditional UWB-based tightly-coupled models is that the Vision/IMU/UWB tightly-coupled model in this study uses UWB base station coordinates as parameters for real-time estimation without pre-calibrating UWB base stations. Aiming at the dynamic change of sensor availability in multi-sensor integrated navigation system and the serious problem of traditional factor graph in the weight distribution of observation information, this study proposes an adaptive robust factor graph model. Based on redundant measurement information, we propose a novel adaptive estimation model for UWB ranging covariance, which does not rely on prior information of the system and can adaptively estimate real-time covariance changes of UWB ranging. The algorithm proposed in this study was extensively tested in real-world scenarios, and the results show that the proposed system is superior to the most advanced combination method in all cases.

The antiapoptotic effect and potential mechanism of Q808, an innovative anticonvulsant chemical, have never been reported.

The morphological change and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus were detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. The hippocampal transcriptomic changes were observed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The expression levels of hub genes were verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Results revealed that Q808 could allay the seizure score and prolong the stage 2 latency in seizure rats. The morphological changes of neurons and the number of apoptotic cells in the DG area were diminished by Q808 treatment. RNA-seq analysis revealed eight hub genes, including Map2k3, Nfs1, Chchd4, Hdac6, Siglec5, Slc35d3, Entpd1, and LOC103690108, and nine hub pathways among the control, PTZ, and Q808 groups.

IGS discriminated between cases and controls in an independent whole-blood RNA-sequencing study (1176 PD, 254 prodromal, and 860 healthy controls) with mean AUC and accuracy of 64.8% and 69.4% for PD cohort, and 78.8% and 74% for prodromal cohort. PATL2 was the top-performing imputed gene in both PD and prodromal PD cohorts, whose classifier performance varied with biological sex (higher performance for males and females in the PD and prodromal PD, respectively). Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies (scRNA-seq) of healthy humans and PD patients found PATL2 to be enriched in terminal effector CD8+ and cytotoxic CD4+ cells, whose proportions are both increased in PD patients.

The effect of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling suppression was also assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) incorporation. We found that signaling pathways critical for osteoblast differentiation were strongly downregulated in CKD osteoblasts. Gene set enrichment analysis identified highly significant methylation changes, differential chromatin accessibility, and altered RNA expression in NFAT signaling targets. NFAT inhibition reduced osteoblast proliferation. Combined analysis of osteoblast RNA expression and whole bone matrix composition identified 13 potential ligand-receptor pairs. In summary, epigenetic changes in CKD osteoblasts associate with altered expression of multiple osteoblast genes and signaling pathways. An increase in NFAT signaling may play a role in impaired CKD osteoblast maturation. Epigenetic changes also associate with an altered bone matrix, which may contribute to bone fragility. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the pathways affected by these genetic alterations since elucidating these pathways will be vital to correcting the underlying biology of bone disease in the CKD population.", "Keywords": ["CKD", "NFAT", "bone matrix", "epigenetics", "osteoblast maturation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aline", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Center for Translational Metabolism and Health, Feinberg Cardiovascular and Renal Research Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208."}, {"First Name": "Riki", "Last Name": "Kawaguchi", "Affiliation": "Program in Neurogenetics, Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Program in Neurogenetics, Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Isidro B", "Last Name": "Salusky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Renata C", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Wesseling-Perry", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, The University of Arizona, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ 850156."}], "Journal": "JBMR plus", "PubDate": "2024Jan"}, {"PMID": "38690868", "Title": "Me3SiBr-promoted cascade electrophilic thiocyanation/cyclization of ortho-alkynylanilines to synthesize indole derivatives.", "Abstract": "A Lewis acid-promoted electrophilic thiocyanation/cyclization of ortho-alkynylanilines for the synthesis of indole derivatives has been developed.

To meet such a need, this study proposed and constructed an innovative point-of-care testing (POCT) platform that consists of a hydrogen ion-selective loop-mediated isothermal amplification (H+-LAMP) sensor and an electrochemical detection device. The H+-LAMP sensor successfully integrated the working and reference electrodes and converted the H+ generated during the LAMP process into an electrochemical signal. High sensitivity and stability for pathogen detection were also achieved by treating the working electrode with an electrodeposited polyaniline solid contact layer and by using an ion-selective membrane. As a result, the sensor shows a sensitivity of 68.26 mV per pH, a response time of less than 2 s, and a potential drift of less than 5 mV within one hour, which well meets the urgent need. The results also demonstrated that the detection limit for Mycoplasma pneumoniae was lowered to 1 copy per \u03bcL, the nucleic acid extraction and detection process could be completed in 30 minutes, and the impact of interfering ions on the sensor was negligible. Validation with 20 clinical samples yielded satisfactory results. More importantly, the storage lifespan of such an electrochemical sensor is over seven days, which is a great advantage for on-site pathogen detection.

In this study, the effects of process parameters on ARGs during aerobic composting of pig manure were explored through data mining based on 191 valid data collected from literature. Machine learning (ML) models (XGBoost and Random Forest) were utilized to predict the rate of ARGs changes during pig manure composting. The model evaluation index of the XGBoost model (R2 = 0.651) was higher than that of the Random Forest (R2 = 0.490), indicating that XGBoost had better prediction performance. Feature importance was further calculated for the XGBoost model, and the XGBoost black box model was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations analysis. Results indicated that the influencing factors on the ARGs variation in pig manure were sequentially divided into thermophilic period, total composting period, composting real time, and thermophilic stage average temperature.

The poor solubility of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class IV drugs poses challenges in achieving optimal bioavailability. Numerous anti-cancer drugs including paclitaxel (PTX) belong to the BCS class IV, hindering their therapeutic efficacy. To address this concern, our study explored SAS-FB technology to coat PTX with D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) onto lactose. Under our optimized conditions, we achieved a PTX coating efficiency of 96.8%. Further characterization confirmed the crystalline state of PTX in the lactose surface coating by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. Dissolution studies indicated that SAS-FB processed samples release over 95% of the drug within 1 min. Moreover, cell transmembrane transport assays demonstrated that SAS-FB processed PTX samples co-coated with TPGS had an enhanced PTX internalization into cells and a higher permeability coefficient compared to those without TPGS. Finally, compared to unprocessed PTX, SAS-FB (TPGS) and SAS-FB processed samples showed a 2.66- and 1.49-fold increase in oral bioavailability in vivo, respectively.

In this work, no organic templates were needed to produce high-performance ZSM-5 membranes with an extremely low Si/Al ratio of 3.3 on \u03b1-Al2O3 tubular supports using 100\u00a0nm nanoseeds. The effects of preparation parameters on the crystalline phase structures, micromorphologies, and PV separation performance of ZSM-5 membranes were comprehensively investigated. The results revealed that the Si/Al ratio of gels significantly affected both the Si/Al ratio and the crystal orientation of the final ZSM-5 membrane. The optimized ZSM-5 membrane with a thickness of 1.8\u00a0\u03bcm was utilized to dehydrate various organic solvents via PV, and the influence of the operating parameters on PV dehydration performance was evaluated and is described herein. Furthermore, the permeation behaviors of single gases and PV were examined using permeate molecules within a similar size range to reveal the PV mechanism of the ZSM-5 membrane. The results demonstrated that gas permeation followed Knudsen diffusion, while PV permeation was decreased with decreases in the affinity of molecules, revealing an adsorption-diffusion mechanism that dominated PV dehydration through the ZSM-5 membrane.

This article reviews the research on gene diagnosis, surgical treatment, chemotherapy, and biological therapy of LGSOC, providing reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment of LGSOC. Surgery is the cornerstone of LGSOC treatment and maximum effort must be made to achieve R0 removal. Although LGSOC is not sensitive to chemotherapy, postoperative platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment option for LGSOC. Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical benefits of chemotherapy and explore new chemotherapy protocols. Hormone and targeted therapies may also play important roles. Some patients, particularly those with residual lesions after treatment, may benefit from hormone maintenance therapy after chemotherapy. Targeted therapies, such as MEKi, show good application prospects and are expected to change the treatment pattern of LGSOC. Continuing to further study the genomics of LGSOC, identify its specific gene changes, and combine traditional treatment methods with precision targeted therapy based on second-generation sequencing may be the direction for LGSOC to overcome the treatment bottleneck.

Existing studies demonstrate that both authoritarian leadership and laissez-faire leadership can exacerbate time theft, putting leaders in a behavioral dilemma of neither being strict nor lenient. Additionally, the pervasive and covert nature of time theft diminishes the effectiveness of subsequent corrective actions. Our study aims to investigate how to prevent time theft by mitigating employees' inclinations. Based on role theory, our study examines whether supervisor developmental feedback can encourage employees to perform work roles more appropriately. To uncover the complicated internalization process of role expectation, our study incorporates perceived insider status and work passion as serial mediators and considers the boundary effect of leaders' word-deed consistency. In Study 1, a survey of 402 employees revealed that supervisor developmental feedback can negatively predict employee time theft through employees' perceived insider status and work passion. Study 2 employs the same sample to further identify three topics of supervisor developmental feedback: skill learning, attitude learning, and social learning. Moreover, serial multiple mediating effects are affirmed across topics.

Now, the disorder of the gut microbiome is considered as one of the main causes of FM. This study aimed to investigate the potential benefits of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with FM. A total of 45 patients completed this open-label, randomized, nonplacebo-controlled clinical study. The numerical rating scale scores in the FMT group were slightly lower than the control group at 1 month (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05), and they decreased significantly at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Besides, compared with the control group, the Widespread Pain Index, Symptom Severity, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were significantly lower in the FMT group at different time points (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). After 6 months of treatment, there was a significant increase in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), while glutamate levels significantly decreased in the FMT group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

FMT can effectively improve the clinical symptoms of FM. With the close relations between the changes in neurotransmitters and FM, certain neurotransmitters may serve as a diagnostic marker or potential target for FM patients.

This study aims to examine the intra-dyadic associations between stigma, communication patterns, and infertility-related stress in couples undergoing artificial insemination by donor semen (AID). This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to April 2021. Two hundred and three couples undergoing AID were recruited from a reproductive centre in China. All of the couples completed a two-item stigma questionnaire, Communication Pattern Questionnaire, and Fertility Problem Inventory. The actor-partner interdependence mediation analysis was performed using AMOS 23.0. The analysis demonstrated significant actor-actor effects for couples undergoing AID. More specifically, higher levels of stigma among wives and husbands were associated with more negative communication patterns, thereby increasing their own infertility-related stress. Simultaneously, there was a significant partner-actor effect among infertile wives, demonstrating that the husband's stigma can affect his wife's infertility-related stress by influencing her communication patterns. Couples undergoing AID experience increased infertility-related stress when they have high levels of stigma and negative communication patterns, and husbands' stigma is correlated to wives' communication patterns.

Kartogenin (KGN) has been found to promote the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into chondrocytes for the treatment of cartilage damage in early OA. However, KGN, as a small hydrophobic molecule, is rapidly cleared from the synovial fluid after intra-articular injection. This study synthesized a KGN-loaded nanocarrier based on PLGA/polydopamine core/shell structure to treat OA. The fluorescence signal of KGN@PLGA/PDA-PEG-E7 nanoparticles lasted for 4 weeks, ensuring long-term sustained release of KGN from a single intra-articular injection. In addition, the polyphenolic structure of PDA enables it to effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species, and the BMSC-targeting peptide E7 (EPLQLKM) endows KGN@PLGA/PDA-PEG-E7 NPs with an effective affinity for BMSCs. As a result, the KGN@PLGA/PDA-PEG-E7 nanoparticles could effectively induce cartilage in vitro and protect the cartilage and subchondral bone in a rat ACLT model.

Dicoumarol is a coumarin\u2011like compound derived from sweet clover [Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall]. It has been suggested that dicoumarol exhibits various types of pharmacological activities, including anticoagulant, antitumor and antibacterial effects. Due to its various biological activities, dicoumarol has a potential protective effect against OA. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of dicoumarol on knee osteoarthritis. In the present study, dicoumarol was found to protect rat synoviocytes from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2011induced cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that dicoumarol significantly reduced the protein expression levels of fibrosis\u2011related markers and inflammatory cytokines (Tgfb, Timp, Col1a, Il1b and Il18). The inhibitory rates of these proteins were all >50% (P<0.01) compared with those in the LPS and ATP\u2011induced group. Consistently, the mRNA expression levels of these markers and cytokines were decreased to normal levels by dicoumarol after the treatment of rat synovial fibroblasts with LPS and ATP. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dicoumarol did not affect NF\u2011\u03baB signaling, but it did directly interact with NOD\u2011like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) to promote its protein degradation, which could be reversed by MG132, but not NH4Cl. The protein half\u2011life of NLRP3 was accelerated from 26.1 to 4.3 h by dicoumarol. Subsequently, dicoumarol could alleviate KOA in vivo; knee joint diameter was decreased from 11.03 to 9.93 mm. Furthermore, the inflammation and fibrosis of the knee joints were inhibited in rats. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated that dicoumarol could impede the progression of KOA by inhibiting NLRP3 activation, providing a potential treatment strategy for KOA.", "Keywords": ["NOD\u2011like receptor protein 3", "dicoumarol", "fibrosis", "inflammation", "knee osteoarthritis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Rats", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Cytokines", "Dicumarol", "Fibrosis", "Inflammasomes", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "NLR Proteins", "Osteoarthritis, Knee"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenjie", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Wuxi Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214000, P.R.

The adsorption experiments showed that Fe/ATP@PPy displayed significantly higher adsorption selectivity for Ni2+ than Cu2+ and Co2+ ions, especially which exhibited an approximate 100.00% removal for both Ni2+ ions and nitrobenzene in the mixture system with a low concentration. Furthermore, combined tracking adsorption of Ni2+ ions and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization confirmed that the effective adsorption occurs via ion transfer coordination; the pathway was further validated at the molecular level through theoretical modeling.

Cellular uptake of Cf48 and its profibrotic response in fibroblasts operated via the transferrin receptor. RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing identified Cf48 binding to mRNA of genes involved in the fibrotic response, including Serpine1, Acta2, Ccn2, and Col4a1. rCf48 binds to the 3'UTR of Serpine1 and increases mRNA half-life.

disorders, have been associated with cognitive impairment and perturbed excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain. Effects in juvenile mice can elucidate how erythropoietin (EPO) might aid in rectifying hippocampal transcriptional networks and synaptic structures of pyramidal lineages, conceivably explaining mitigation of neuropsychiatric diseases. An imminent conundrum is how EPO restores synapses by involving interneurons. By analyzing ~12,000 single-nuclei transcriptomic data, we generated a comprehensive molecular atlas of hippocampal interneurons, resolved into 15 interneuron subtypes. Next, we studied molecular alterations upon recombinant human (rh)EPO and saw that gene expression changes relate to synaptic structure, trans-synaptic signaling and intracellular catabolic pathways. Putative ligand-receptor interactions between pyramidal and inhibitory neurons, regulating synaptogenesis, are altered upon rhEPO. An array of in/ex vivo experiments confirms that specific interneuronal populations exhibit reduced dendritic complexity, synaptic connectivity, and changes in plasticity-related molecules. Metabolism and inhibitory potential of interneuron subgroups are compromised, leading to greater excitability of pyramidal neurons. To conclude, improvement by rhEPO of neuropsychiatric phenotypes may partly owe to restrictive control over interneurons, facilitating re-connectivity and synapse development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yasmina", "Last Name": "Curto", "Affiliation": "Clinical Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "H\u00e9ctor", "Last Name": "Carceller", "Affiliation": "Neuroplasticity Unit, Program in Neurosciences and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BIOTECMED), Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Patrycja", "Last Name": "Klimczak", "Affiliation": "Neuroplasticity Unit, Program in Neurosciences and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BIOTECMED), Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Perez-Rando", "Affiliation": "Neuroplasticity Unit, Program in Neurosciences and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BIOTECMED), Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Grewe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuro- & Sensory Physiology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Riki", "Last Name": "Kawaguchi", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvio", "Last Name": "Rizzoli", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuro- & Sensory Physiology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Geschwind", "Affiliation": "Institute of Precision Health, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Klaus-Armin", "Last Name": "Nave", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurogenetics, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Vicent", "Last Name": "Teruel-Marti", "Affiliation": "Neuronal Circuits Laboratory, Department of Anatomy and Human Embryology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Manvendra", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Clinical Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. manvendra.singh@mpinat.mpg.de."}, {"First Name": "Hannelore", "Last Name": "Ehrenreich", "Affiliation": "Clinical Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences, City Campus, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. hannelore.ehrenreich@web.de."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "N\u00e1cher", "Affiliation": "Neuroplasticity Unit, Program in Neurosciences and Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BIOTECMED), Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot, Spain. nacher@uv.es."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2024Apr15"}, {"PMID": "38621626", "Title": "Establishment and characterization of a kidney cell line from hybrid snakehead (male Channa argus \u00d7 female Channa maculata) and its susceptibility to hybrid snakehead rhabdovirus (HSHRV).", "Abstract": "Hybrid snakehead (male Channa argus \u00d7 female Channa maculata) is an emerging fish breed with increasing production levels.

Here, using cross-species single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that during early embryonic development, METTL16 is more highly expressed in vertebrate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) than other methyltransferases. In Mettl16-deficient zebrafish, proliferation capacity of embryonic HSPCs is compromised due to G1/S cell cycle arrest, an effect whose rescue requires Mettl16 with intact methyltransferase activity. We further identify the cell-cycle transcription factor mybl2b as a directly regulated by Mettl16-mediated m6A modification. Mettl16 deficiency resulted in the destabilization of mybl2b\u00a0mRNA, likely due to lost binding by the m6A reader Igf2bp1 in vivo. Moreover, we found that the METTL16-m6A-MYBL2-IGF2BP1 axis controlling G1/S progression is conserved in humans.

Nonetheless, recovery after severe injuries, such as Achilles tendon injury, is limited. Consequently, there is a pressing need to devise interventions, including biomaterials, that foster tendon healing. Regrettably, tissue engineering treatments have faced obstacles in crafting appropriate tissue scaffolds and efficacious nanomedical approaches. To surmount these hurdles, an innovative injectable hydrogel (CP@SiO2), comprising puerarin and chitosan through in situ self-assembly, is pioneered while concurrently delivering mesoporous silica nanoparticles for tendon healing. In this research, CP@SiO2 hydrogel is employed for the treatment of Achilles tendon injuries, conducting extensive in vivo and in vitro experiments to evaluate its efficacy. This reults demonstrates that CP@SiO2 hydrogel enhances the proliferation and differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells, and mitigates inflammation through the modulation of macrophage polarization. Furthermore, using histological and behavioral analyses, it is found that CP@SiO2 hydrogel can improve the histological and biomechanical properties of injured tendons. This findings indicate that this multifaceted injectable CP@SiO2 hydrogel constitutes a suitable bioactive material for tendon repair and presents a promising new strategy for the clinical management of tendon injuries.", "Keywords": ["hydrogel", "inflammation", "mesoporous silica", "regeneration", "tendon healing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Renwen", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiwen", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoshuang", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinting", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanwei", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Fangqi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenbo", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Beijie", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Shanghai Pudong Hospital, Fudan University Pudong Medical Center, No.2800 GongWei road, Shanghai, 200100, China."}, {"First Name": "Haocheng", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Hanli", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongyi", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 325000, China."}, {"First Name": "Junming", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Laboratory Animal Center, Guangxi Medical University, Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuanyong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Kunshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 388 Zu Chong Zhi Road, Kunshan, Jiangsu, 215300, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiliang", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiajun", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China."}, {"First Name": "Shiyi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Sports Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}], "Journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "PubDate": "2024Apr09"}, {"PMID": "38589499", "Title": "Peroxymonosulfate enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic dye by metal-free TpTt-COF under visible light irradiation.", "Abstract": "Recently, the activation of persulfate (PDS) by non-metallic photocatalysts under visible light has attracted significant interest in applications in environmental remediation. This study presents a pioneering investigation into the combined application of the TpTt-COF and PMS for visible light degradation of organic dyes. Synthesized orange TpTt-COF monomers exhibit exceptional crystallinity, a 2D structure, and notable stability in harsh conditions. The broad visible light absorption around a wavelength of 708\u00a0nm. The TpTt-COF emerges as a promising candidate for photocatalytic dye degradation. The study addresses high charge recombination in the TpTt-COF, highlighting the crucial role of its electron donor and acceptor for the PMS activation. Comparative analyses against traditional photocatalytic materials, such as the metal-free carbon-based material g-C3N4 and transition metal-containing TiO2, demonstrate TpTt-COF's superior performance, generating diverse free radicals. In simulated experiments, the TpTt-COF's degradation rate surpasses PMS-combined g-C3N4 by 13.9 times. and 1.6 times higher than the TpTt-COF alone. Remarkably, the TpTt-COF maintains high activity under harsh environments. Investigations into the degradation mechanism and the TpTt-COF's reusability reveal its efficiency and stability. Under visible light, TpTt-COF facilitates efficient electron-hole separation. Combining the TpTt-COF with PMS produces various radicals, ensuring effective separation and a synergistic effect. Radical quenching experiments confirm the pivotal role of O2-\u00b7 radicals, while \u00b7OH and SO4-\u00b7 radicals intensify the degradation. After five cycles, TpTt-COF maintains an impressive 83.2% degradation efficiency.

Current therapeutic approaches to treat corneal angiogenesis, in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A plays a central role, can cause a variety of adverse side effects. The technology of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 can edit VEGFA gene to suppress its expression. CRISPR offers a novel opportunity to treat CNV. This study shows that depletion of VEGFA with a novel CRISPR/Cas9 system inhibits proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Importantly, subconjunctival injection of this dual AAV-SpCas9/sgRNA-VEGFA system is demonstrated which blocks suture-induced expression of VEGFA, CD31, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin as well as corneal neovascularization in mice.

Herein, five nonantimicrobial pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen (ACT), clofibric acid (CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CF) and nicotine (NCT), tetracycline-resistant strains, five ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetG, tetM and tetW) and one integrase gene (intI1), were detected in 101 wastewater samples during two typical sewage treatment processes including anaerobic-oxic (A/O) and biological aerated filter (BAF) in Harbin, China. The impact of nonantibiotic pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations on both the resistance genotypes and resistance phenotypes were explored. The results showed that a significant impact of nonantibiotic pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations on tetracycline resistance genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs) was found, while no changes in antibiotic phenotypes, such as minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were observed. Machine learning was applied to further sort out the contribution of nonantibiotic pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations to different ARG subtypes. The highest contribution and correlation were found at concentrations of 1400-1800\u00a0ng/L for NCT, 900-1500\u00a0ng/L for ACT and 7000-10,000\u00a0ng/L for CF for tetracycline resistance genes encoding RPPs, while no significant correlation was found between the target compounds and ARGs when their concentrations were lower than 500\u00a0ng/L for NCT, 100\u00a0ng/L for ACT and 1000\u00a0ng/L for CF, which were higher than the concentrations detected in effluent samples.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule and plays a crucial role in regulating the fruit postharvest quality. In this study, we investigated the effects of NO treatment on changes in sensory and firmness of bitter melon fruit during postharvest storage. Moreover, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses were performed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms through which NO treatment delays the ripening and senescence of bitter melon fruit. Our results show that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in fruit texture (CSLE, \u03b2-Gal, and PME), plant hormone signal transduction (ACS, JAR4, and AUX28), and fruit flavor and aroma (SUS2, LOX, and GDH2). In addition, proteins differentially abundant were associated with fruit texture (PLY, PME, and PGA) and plant hormone signal transduction (PBL15, JAR1, and PYL9). Moreover, NO significantly increased the abundance of key enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, thus enhancing the disease resistance and alleviating softening of bitter melon fruit. Finally, differential metabolites mainly included phenolic acids, terpenoids, and flavonoids.

emerging pathogen that causes massive economic losses to the poultry industry in China and neighbouring countries. Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, has been demonstrated to be involved in viral replication during infection. However, the specific role of vimentin in DTMUV replication has not been determined. In this study, we found that overexpression of vimentin in BHK-21 cells can inhibit DTMUV replication. Moreover, DTMUV replication was enhanced after vimentin expression was reduced in BHK-21 cells via small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further research indicated that DTMUV infection had no effect on the transcription or expression of vimentin. However, we found that DTMUV infection induced vimentin rearrangement, and the rearrangement of vimentin was subsequently confirmed to negatively modulate viral replication through the use of a vimentin network disrupting agent. Vimentin rearrangement is closely associated with its phosphorylation. Our experiments revealed that the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser56 was promoted in the early stage of DTMUV infection. In addition, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser56 with a CDK5 inhibitor, vimentin rearrangement was suppressed, and DTMUV replication was significantly enhanced. These results indicated that DTMUV infection induced vimentin phosphorylation and rearrangement through CDK5, resulting in the inhibition of DTMUV replication. In summary, our study reveals a role for vimentin as a negative factor in the process of DTMUV replication, which helps to elucidate the function of cellular proteins in regulating DTMUV replication.", "Keywords": ["CDK5", "Duck Tembusu virus", "Rearrangement", "Vimentin", "Viral replication"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Ducks", "Vimentin", "Flavivirus", "Flavivirus Infections", "Virus Replication", "Poultry Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guangbin", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Shinuo", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Chunyan", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Guijun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University,\u00a0Hefei 230036,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Hongjie", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University,\u00a0Nanjing 210095,\u00a0China; College of Animal Science, Anhui Science and Technology University,\u00a0Fengyang 233100,\u00a0China.

In this study, Mg and La were chosen as binary metals in the synthesis of Mg-La LDH to enhance phosphate efficient adsorption. Different molar ratios of Mg to La (2:1, 3:1, and 4:1) were investigated to further enhance P adsorption. The best performing Mg-La LDH, with Mg to La ratio is 4:1 (LDH-4), presented a larger adsorption capacity and faster adsorption rate than other Mg-La LDH. The maximum adsorption capacity (87.23 mg/g) and the rapid adsorption rate in the initial 25 min of LDH-4 (70 mg/(g\u00b7h)) were at least 1.6 times and 1.8 times higher than the others.

Thus, this regulated RAC, with a 3.5-fold enhancement in advantageous OCFGs (a-OCFGs: CO and COO), exhibits a supreme specific capacitance of 286.4F\u00a0g-1 at 1 A/g and an excellent capacitance retention rate of 89.7\u00a0% at 20 A/g in an aqueous electrolyte, considerably surpassing that of nonregulated RAC (212.0F\u00a0g-1 and 81.9\u00a0%). This confirms that a-OCFGs provide ample ion-storage accommodation and suppress solvent electronic oxidation, thereby enhancing electrochemical performance. Furthermore, its electrochemical performance is competitive with that of the commercial YP-50F (129.2F\u00a0g-1 at 1 A/g).

The pathogenesis of PCOS is still unclear and further exploration is needed. Here, proteomic analysis indicated that the expression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) protein in ovarian tissue of PCOS mice was significantly decreased. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between potential biomarkers of PCOS and granulosa cells (GCs) function. The mechanisms by which FDPS affected the proliferation of granulosa cells were also explored both in vitro and in vivo. We found that knockdown of FDPS inhibited the proliferation of KGN (human ovarian granulosa cell line), while overexpression of FDPS had the opposite effect. FDPS activated Rac1 (Rac Family Small GTPase 1) activity and regulated MAPK/ERK signalling pathway, which affecting the proliferation of KGN cells significantly. In addition, treatment with the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-FDPS reverses the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS-phenotype in mice. Our data indicated that FDPS could regulate the proliferation of ovarian GCs by modulating MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinases) pathway via activating Rac1 activity.

It has been widely studied for its excellent physicochemical and beneficial properties. However, the high molecular weight and high viscosity of KC make it difficult to be absorbed and to exert its' biological activities, thus limit its extensive industrial application. In order to solve this problem, five low molecular weight \u03ba-carrageenans (DCPs) were prepared by the degradation of KC using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbic acid (AH2). The chemical compositions and structure characteristics of the DCPs were then determined. The results showed that H2O2 and AH2 could effectively degrade KC to DCPs, and DCPs remained the basic skeletal structure of KC. DCPs showed good antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of DCPs with the highest antibacterial effects were 5.25, 4.5, 5.25, and 4.5\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. This is due to the underlying mechanism of DCPs that bind to the bacterial membrane proteins and change the membrane permeability, thus exerting antibacterial activity. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation and Ridge regression analysis revealed that the molecular weight and the contents of 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose, aldehyde group, carboxyl, and sulfate were the main structural characteristics affecting the antibacterial activity.

Acute acetylcholine stimulation induced sustained calcium oscillations and long-lasting transcriptional reprogramming of GBM cells into a more invasive state via the metabotropic CHRM3 receptor. CHRM3 downregulation suppressed GBM cell invasion, proliferation, and survival in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results reveal the capacity of human GBM cells to rapidly and robustly integrate into anatomically and molecularly diverse neuronal circuitry in the adult brain and support a model wherein rapid synapse formation onto GBM cells and transient activation of upstream neurons may lead to a long-lasting increase in fitness to promote tumor infiltration and progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yusha", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel Y", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhijian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janardhan P", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yingqi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weifan", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristen H", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jamie", "Last Name": "Galanaugh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abhijeet", "Last Name": "Sambangi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sang Hoon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Garrett", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiago", "Last Name": "Goncalves", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Geschwind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riki", "Last Name": "Kawaguchi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Huadong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fuqiang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zev A", "Last Name": "Binder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Isaac H", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily Ling-Lin", "Last Name": "Pai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "MacLean", "Last Name": "Nasrallah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kimberly M", "Last Name": "Christian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Fuccillo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald M", "Last Name": "O'Rourke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Minghong", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guo-Li", "Last Name": "Ming", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongjun", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Mar04"}, {"PMID": "38495299", "Title": "Activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis by glutaredoxin 2 overexpression antagonizes vascular endothelial cell oxidative injury and inflammation under LPS exposure.", "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis constitutes a proverbial pathogenic mechanism for cardio-cerebrovascular disease that accounts for the most common cause of disability and morbidity for human health worldwide. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are the key contributors to the progression of atherosclerosis. Glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2) is abundantly existed in various tissues and possesses a range of pleiotropic efficacy including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. However, its role in atherosclerosis is still undefined. Here, down-regulation of GLRX2 was validated in lipopolysaccha (LPS)-induced vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, elevation of GLRX2 reversed the inhibition of cell viability in LPS-treated HUVECs and decreased LPS-induced increases in cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. Additionally, enhancement of GLRX2 expression antagonized oxidative stress in HUVECs under LPS exposure by inhibiting ROS, lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde production and increased activity of anti-oxidative stress superoxide dismutase. Notably, GLRX2 abrogated LPS-evoked transcripts and releases of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2), chemokine MCP-1 and adhesion molecule ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling was demonstrated in LPS-stimulated HUVECs. Importantly, blockage of the Nrf2 pathway counteracted the protective roles of GLRX2 in LPS-triggered endothelial cell injury, oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Thus, these data reveal that GLRX2 may alleviate the progression of atherosclerosis by regulating vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation via the activation of the Nrf2 signaling, supporting a promising therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis and its complications.", "Keywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Inflammation", "LPS", "Oxidative injury", "Vascular endothelial cell"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuna", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, No. 3 Yongding Road East Street, Beijing, 100039 People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jinlin", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Technology Support, Jingxi Medical District, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100097 People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, No. 3 Yongding Road East Street, Beijing, 100039 People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, No. 3 Yongding Road East Street, Beijing, 100039 People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, No. 3 Yongding Road East Street, Beijing, 100039 People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenan", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, No. 3 Yongding Road East Street, Beijing, 100039 People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "Cytotechnology", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38493858", "Title": "Empirical analysis of lead neurotoxicity mode of action and its application in health risk assessment.", "Abstract": "The mode of action (MOA) framework is proposed to inform a biological link between chemical exposures and adverse health effects.

We first conducted a quantitative weight of evidence (qWOE) assessment, which revealed that the MOA has a moderate confidence. Then, targeted bioassays were performed within an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model to quantitatively validate the scientific validity of key events (KEs) in terms of essentiality and concordance of empirical support (dose/temporal concordance), which increases confidence in utilizing the MOA for RA. Building upon the quantitative validation data, we further conducted benchmark dose (BMD) analysis to map dose-response relationships for the critical toxicity pathways, and the lower limit of BMD at a 5% response (BMDL5) was identified as the point of departure (POD) value for adverse health effects. Notably, perturbation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling pathway exhibited the lowest POD value, measured at 0.0062\u00a0\u03bcM. Considering bioavailability, we further calculated a provisional health-based guidance value (HBGV) for children's lead intake, determining it to be 2.56\u00a0\u03bcg/day. Finally, the health risk associated with the HBGV was assessed using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach, which indicated that the HBGV established in this study is a relative safe reference value for lead intake.

The special loop structure of circRNA makes it highly stable and specific in diseased tissues and cells, especially in tumors. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) compete for the binding of microRNA (miRNA) at specific binding sites and thus regulate gene expression. ceRNAs play an important role in various diseases and are currently recognized as the most prominent mechanism of action of circRNAs. circRNAs can modulate the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of tumor cells through the ceRNA mechanism. With further research, circRNAs may serve as novel markers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer (OC).

In clinical, we found that Zoledronic acid (ZA) may increase the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To explore the underlying mechanism, we established a mouse model of HCC by subcutaneously injecting Hepa1-6 cell line. The result showed that the tumor volume in the ZA plus anti-PD-1 monocloning antibody (anti-PD-1 mAb) treatment groups was significantly smaller than that of control group, and the onset time of tumor inhibition was even shorter than that of the anti-PD-1 mAb group. Using flow cytometry (FC) to detect the proportion of major immune cell subsets in tumor tissues of each group of mice, we found that the synergistic anti-tumor effect of ZA and anti-PD-1 mAb may be related to ZA-induced polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype. Next, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on tumor samples from different groups to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then input DEGs into pathway enrichment analysis. Data indicated that ZA participated in the M1-type\u00a0polarization via ferroptosis-related pathways.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are the crucial mediators regulating the response of interferon (IFN) to combat invading viruses, have not yet been reported in tilapia during TiLV infection. Here, six IRF (IRF1, IRF2, IRF4, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9) homologs from tilapia were characterized and analyzed. These IRFs typically shared the conserved domains and phylogenetic relationship with IRF homologs of other species. Tissue distribution analysis showed that all six IRF genes were expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in immune-related tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of IRFs in tilapia brain (TiB) cells significantly inhibited TiLV propagation, as evidenced by decreased viral segment 8 gene transcripts and copy numbers of viral segment 1. More importantly, all six IRF genes significantly enhanced the promoter activity of type I interferon-a3 (IFNa3) in TiB cells, suggesting that tilapia IRF genes serve as positive regulators in activating IFNa3. Surprisingly, the promoter activity of IFNa3 mediated by IRF genes was markedly inhibited post-TiLV infection, indicating that TiLV antagonized IRF-mediated IFN immune response. Taken together, six IRF genes of tilapia are highly conserved transcription factors that inhibit TiLV infection by activating the promoter of IFNa3, which is in turn restrained by TiLV. These findings broaden our knowledge about the functionality of IRF-mediated antiviral immunity in tilapia against TiLV infection and host-TiLV interaction, which lays a foundation for developing antiviral strategies in tilapia cultural industries.", "Keywords": ["Innate immunity", "Interferon", "Interferon regulatory factor", "Tilapia", "Tilapia lake virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Tilapia", "Interferons", "Cichlids", "Phylogeny", "Fish Diseases", "Interferon Regulatory Factors", "Viruses", "Virus Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zishan", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China; College of Fisheries and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, 201306, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China; College of Fisheries and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, 201306, China."}, {"First Name": "Siyu", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Agro-biological Gene Research Center, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, 510640, China."}, {"First Name": "Defeng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Xubing", "Last Name": "Mo", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiyuan", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Cunbin", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Key Laboratory of Fishery Drug Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Immunology and Sustainable Aquaculture, Guangzhou, 510380, China.

This study aimed to understand how LULC affected hydrological connectivity in the coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China, from 1985 to 2020. A framework from a landscape resistance perspective was used to evaluate the LULC's influence. LULCs were converted into a series of resistance surfaces whose values represent the degree to which LULC facilitated or restricted hydrological connectivity. The LULC's influence was evaluated by parameterizing the resistance surfaces using observed hydrological connectivity. The results showed that human-related LULC had more influence on hydrological connectivity. The critical time of LULC's influence on hydrological connectivity was 1985-1990 and 2010-2015. The critical areas were Zone II, Zone I, and Zone VI. The LULCs of agriculture, industry, town/city, and river had the most significant impact on the hydrological connectivity of the YRD coastal wetland. The result could direct LULC planning to mitigate the negative effect on coastal wetlands and provide support for the environmental impact assessment of coastal development practices.

However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox-mediated zinc-air fuel cell (HRM-ZAFC) utilizing 7,8-dihydroxyphenazine-2-sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation flexibility and scalability for large-scale power generation applications. The DHPS-mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51\u2005W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82\u2005Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.", "Keywords": ["in situ characterization", "mass transfer", "reaction kinetics", "redox-mediated reaction", "zinc-air fuel cell"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuxi", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Lingchao", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Real Estate, Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development (RISUD) and Research Institute for Smart Energy (RISE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Manohar", "Last Name": "Salla", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Shibo", "Last Name": "Xi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment (ISCE2), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), 1 Pesek Road, Jurong Island, 627833, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Weiyin", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Wanwan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), 2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore, 138634, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Mengqi", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Songpeng", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Shiqiang", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Xun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Xingzi", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University, No.174, Shazheng Street, Shapingba District, 400044, China."}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Niu", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University, No.174, Shazheng Street, Shapingba District, 400044, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuqi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University, No.174, Shazheng Street, Shapingba District, 400044, China."}, {"First Name": "Shijie", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), 2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore, 138634, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Temasek Polytechnic, 21 Tampines Ave 1, 529757, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Real Estate, Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development (RISUD) and Research Institute for Smart Energy (RISE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Hang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore."}], "Journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "PubDate": "2024Apr15"}, {"PMID": "38388846", "Title": "Slc43a2+ T cell metastasis from spleen to brain in RGNNV infected teleost.", "Abstract": "The origin of T cells in the teleost's brain is unclear.

Compared to trisulfide and disulfide bonds, tetrasulfide bonds endow DPNAs with superlative self-assembly stability, prolonged blood circulation, and high tumor accumulation. Notably, the ultra-high reduction responsivity of tetrasulfide bonds make DPNAs a highly selective \"tumor bomb\" that can be ignited by endogenous reducing agents in tumor cells. Furthermore, we present an \"add fuel to the flames\" strategy to intensify the reductive stress at tumor sites by replenishing exogenous reducing agents, making considerable progress in selective tumor inhibition.

It was observed that after the initially uneven surface of the petals is filled with infiltrated water, it exhibits a distinctive transparent beauty after rainfall. Furthermore, the presence of leaf veins enhances the structural strength of the petals and facilitates nutrient transport. Inspired by previous studies on double-layer spin-coated films, we further developed and designed the TA TiO2@MWCNT photocathode thin film. This innovative film incorporates multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) into a previously established TA TiO2 photocathode thin film. The inclusion of MWCNT results in the formation of a three-dimensional highway structure, where MWCNT intertwines within the TA TiO2 film. Under the operational state of immersion in the electrolyte, it maintains a level of transparency similar to that of the TA TiO2 photoanode thin film. The high-temperature sintering process results in the oxidation and depletion of MWCNTs on the surface of the film, leaving behind uniformly dispersed concave defects, thereby greatly enhancing the specific surface area. The findings demonstrate that the optoelectrode of high transparency and high specific surface area, TA TiO2@MWCNT, comprehensively enhances the performance of the solar cells. The transparent QDSSC surpasses its counterparts for the first time, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.335%.

seriously threatens human life. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit essential functions in AD development. Nevertheless, the detailed effects and possible mechanisms of lncRNA Wilms tumor 1 Antisense RNA (WT1-AS) in AD are largely unknown. In our studies, a total of 30 serum samples from AD patients were collected, and WT1-AS expressions were detected through qRT-PCR analysis. Additionally, an in vitro AD model was constructed by treating A\u03b21-42 in human neuroblastoma cells. Functional assays were implemented to assess the impacts of WT1-AS on A\u03b21-42-stimulated human neuroblastoma cell proliferation together with apoptosis. Moreover, relationship of WT1-AS, microRNA (miR)-186-5p as well as cyclin D2 (CCND2) could be predicted through bioinformatics tools as well as proved via dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Our results showed that WT1-AS together with CCND2 were low-expressed, while miR-186-5p presented high expression in AD serum samples together with A\u03b21-42-stimulated human neuroblastoma cells. WT1-AS over-expression or miR-186-5p depletion notably promoted the proliferation, reduced the apoptosis, and decreased the p-Tau protein expressions of human neuroblastoma cells induced with A\u03b21-42. Moreover, miR-186-5p combined with WT1-AS, and CCND2 was modulated by miR-186-5p. Furthermore, CCND2 elevation partially offsets the impacts of miR-186-5p elevation on A\u03b21-42-stimulated cell proliferation as well as apoptosis mediated with WT1-AS up-regulation.

In our study, we aimed to construct artificial circular non-coding RNAs (acircRNAs) consisting of three functional units that mimic the CRISPR-Cas system and elucidate its therapeutic role in bladder cancer. Additionally, the compare of the efficiency in regulating gene expression between acircRNA and CRISPR-dCas systems was performed. We connected the cDNA sequences of TFs aptamer and constructed a circRNA. To demonstrate the platform's practicality, \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB were chosen as functional targets, while T24 and 5637 cell lines served as test models. Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR), double luciferase assay and related phenotype assay were used to detect the expression of related genes and the therapeutic effect. To elucidate the functionality of acircRNAs, luciferase vectors capable of detecting \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB expression were employed to assess the inhibitory impact of acircRNA on \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB. Consequently, the optimal combination involving acircRNA-3 was determined. Next, qPCR assay was employed to assess the relative expression levels of target downstream genes following acircRNA treatment. The expression of c-myc and cyclin D1 were used to determine the function of \u03b2-catenin, while Bcl-XL and TRAF1 were used to determine that of NF-\u03baB. The acircRNAs inhibited the \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB related signaling in BCa cells specifically. CD63-HuR fusion protein was used to loading acircRNA into exosomes. The results showed that acircRNA could inhibit the activity of the target transcription factors, and the inhibitory effect was better than that of CRIPSR-dCas9-KRAB. Furthermore, functional experiments demonstrated that the transfection of acircRNA in bladder cells resulted in decreased proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and suppressed migration. In conclusion, our synthetic gene device exhibited anti-tumor regulatory capabilities and showed greater efficiency in tumor suppression compared to the CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB system. Therefore, our device provides a new strategy for cancer treatment and could be a useful strategy for cancer cells.", "Keywords": ["AcircRNA", "Bladder Cancer", "CRISPR-Cas9", "NF-\u03baB", "\u03b2-catenin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qun", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Yachun", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Lexi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Baoyuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenke", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Department of Urology, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, 421002, Hunan, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of Cancer", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38369544", "Title": "Dissection of mRNA ac4C acetylation modifications in AC and Nr fruits: insights into the regulation of fruit ripening by ethylene.", "Abstract": "N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification of mRNA has been shown to be present in plant RNAs, but its regulatory function in plant remains largely unexplored.

Our previous work established that glucoprivic feeding requires ventrolateral medullary (VLM) catecholamine (CA) neurons that coexpress neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, the connections by which VLM CA/NPY neurons trigger increased feeding are uncertain. We have previously shown that glucoprivation, induced by an anti-glycolygic agent 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), activates perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH) neurons and that expression of NPY in the VLM CA/NPY neurons is required for glucoprivic feeding. We therefore hypothesized that glucoprivic feeding and possibly other CRRs require NPY-sensitive PeFLH neurons. To test this, we used the ribosomal toxin conjugate NPY-saporin (NPY-SAP) to selectively lesion NPY receptor-expressing neurons in the PeFLH of male rats. We found that NPY-SAP destroyed a significant number of PeFLH neurons, including those expressing orexin, but not those expressing melanin-concentrating hormone. The PeFLH NPY-SAP lesions attenuated 2DG-induced feeding but did not affect 2DG-induced increase in locomotor activity, sympathoadrenal hyperglycemia, or corticosterone release. The 2DG-induced feeding response was also significantly attenuated in NPY-SAP-treated female rats. Interestingly, PeFLH NPY-SAP lesioned male rats had reduced body weights and decreased dark cycle feeding, but this effect was not seen in female rats. We conclude that a NPY projection to the PeFLH is necessary for glucoprivic feeding, but not locomotor activity, hyperglycemia, or corticosterone release, in both male and female rats.", "Keywords": ["HAAF", "NPY", "NPY-SAP", "glucoprivation", "glucoprivic feeding", "lateral hypothalamus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Male", "Rats", "Deoxyglucose", "Eating", "Feeding Behavior", "Glucose", "Hypothalamic Area, Lateral", "Hypothalamic Hormones", "Hypothalamus", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Melanins", "Neurons", "Neuropeptide Y", "Neuropeptides", "Orexins", "Pituitary Hormones", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Neuropeptide Y", "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1", "Saporins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pique P", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynne A", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ai-Jun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Ritter", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Appleyard", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA."}], "Journal": "Endocrinology", "PubDate": "2024Mar29"}, {"PMID": "38367693", "Title": "Histone H3K36me3 mediates the genomic instability of Benzo[a]pyrene in human bronchial epithelial cells.", "Abstract": "Histone modifications maintain genomic stability and orchestrate gene expression at the chromatin level. Benzo [a]pyrene (BaP) is the ubiquitous carcinogen widely spread in the environment, but the role and regulatory mechanism of histone modification in its toxic effects remain largely undefined. In this study, we found a dose-dependent reduction of histone H3 methylations at lysine4, lysine9, lysine27, lysine36 in HBE cells treated with BaP. We observed that inhibiting H3K27 and H3K36 methylation impaired cell proliferation, whereas the loss of H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 methylation led to increased genomic instability and delayed DNA repair. H3K36 mutation at both H3.1 and H3.3 exhibited the most significant impacts. In addition, we found that the expression of SET domain containing 2 (SETD2), the unique methyltransferase catalyzed H3K36me3, was downregulated by BaP dose-dependently in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SETD2 aggravated DNA damage of BaP exposure, which was consistent with the effects of H3K36 mutation. With the aid of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -seq and RNA-seq, we found that H3K36me3 was responsible for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in pathways related to cell survival, lung cancer, metabolism and inflammation. The enhanced enrichment of H3K36me3 in genes (CYP1A1, ALDH1A3, ACOXL, WNT5A, WNT7A, RUNX2, IL1R2) was positively correlated with their expression levels, while the reduction of H3K36me3 distribution in genes (PPARGC1A, PDE4D, GAS1, RNF19A, KSR1) were in accordance with the downregulation of gene expression.

Although the onset and progression of DPN have been linked with dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia 3 , the contribution of inflammation in the pathogenesis of DPN has not been investigated. Here, we use a High Fat High Fructose Diet (HFHFD) to model DPN and the diabetic metabolic syndrome in mice. Diabetic mice develop persistent heat hypoalgesia after three months, but a reduction in epidermal skin innervation only manifests at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we find that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of diabetic mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. We show that these infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve crush-induced macrophages 4 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglia marker genes 5 although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting this macrophage recruitment in diabetic mice by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signaling results in a more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation. These findings reveal a novel neuroprotective recruitment of macrophages into peripheral nerves of diabetic mice that delays the onset of terminal axonal degeneration, thereby reducing sensory loss. Potentiating and sustaining this early neuroprotective immune response in patients represents, therefore, a potential means to reduce or prevent DPN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Hakim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aakanksha", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Veselina", "Last Name": "Petrova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Indajang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riki", "Last Name": "Kawaguchi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elif Sude", "Last Name": "Duran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Drew", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stuart S", "Last Name": "Adamson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clifford J", "Last Name": "Woolf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan30"}, {"PMID": "38350161", "Title": "Mesopic pupil indices as potential risk factors for glare disability after intraocular implantable collamer lens implantation: prospective study.", "Abstract": "To explore the influence of preoperative factors, including varying pupil sizes and refractive attributes, on postoperative glare disability in patients undergoing implantable collamer lens (ICL) implantation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Young Adult", "Glare", "Lens Implantation, Intraocular", "Mesopic Vision", "Myopia", "Phakic Intraocular Lenses", "Prospective Studies", "Pupil", "Refraction, Ocular", "Risk Factors", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "From the Ophthalmic Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mengyun", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaolong", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nanye", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fu", "Last Name": "Gui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jueling", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zeyu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiwen", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yifeng", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cataract and refractive surgery", "PubDate": "2024Jun01"}, {"PMID": "38348540", "Title": "DNALI1 Promotes Neurodegeneration after Traumatic Brain Injury via Inhibition of Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion.", "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to progressive neurodegeneration that may be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Among 662 colorectal cancer patients, our investigation revealed a significant correlation between cigarette smoking and factors, such as large tumor size, poor differentiation, and high degree of invasion.

Elevated TMUB1 levels were associated with a higher risk of cancer invasion and metastasis, leading to a high mortality risk in patients with colorectal cancer. Additionally, TMUB1 promoted lysine63-linked ubiquitination of AKT by interacting with AMFR, which led to the induction of malignant proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer cells exposed to NNK.

However, effective prevention and control measures are still not available due to a lack of unclear pathogenesis of TiLV. Our previous transcriptome found that coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was in response to TiLV infection in tilapia. To explore the potential function of OnCAR, the effect of OnCAR on TiLV proliferation was analyzed in this study. The OnCAR open reading frame (ORF) sequence of tilapia was 516 bp in length that encoded 171 amino acids with an Ig-like domain and transmembrane region. The OnCAR gene showed widespread expression in all investigated tissues, with the highest levels in the heart. Moreover, the OnCAR gene in the liver and muscle of tilapia exhibited dynamic expression levels upon TiLV challenge. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that OnCAR protein was mainly localized on the membrane of tilapia brain (TiB) cells. Importantly, the gene transcripts, genome copy number, S8-encoded protein, cytopathic effect, and internalization of TiLV were obviously decreased in the TiB cells overexpressed with OnCAR, indicating that OnCAR could inhibit TiLV replication. Mechanically, OnCAR could interact with viral S8 and S10-encoded protein. To the best of our knowledge, OnCAR is the first potential anti-TiLV cellular surface molecular receptor discovered for inhibiting TiLV infection.

Chronic inflammation is common in obese patients, but the mechanism between inflammation and cognitive impairment in obesity remains unclear. Accumulative evidence shows that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a neuroinflammatory and negative synaptic regulator, is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative processes. We investigated the causal role of PTP1B in obesity-induced cognitive impairment and the beneficial effect of PTP1B inhibitors in counteracting impairments of cognition, neural morphology, and signaling. We showed that obese individuals had negative relationship between serum PTP1B levels and cognitive function. Furthermore, the PTP1B level in the forebrain increased in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and obese cognitive impairment mice with the expansion of white matter, neuroinflammation and brain atrophy. PTP1B globally or forebrain-specific knockout mice on an obesogenic high-fat diet showed enhanced cognition and improved synaptic ultrastructure and proteins in the forebrain. Specifically, deleting PTP1B in leptin receptor-expressing cells improved leptin synaptic signaling and increased BDNF expression in the forebrain of obese mice. Importantly, we found that various PTP1B allosteric inhibitors (e.g., MSI-1436, well-tolerated in Phase 1 and 1b clinical trials for obesity and type II diabetes) prevented these alterations, including improving cognition, neurite outgrowth, leptin synaptic signaling and BDNF in both obese cognitive impairment mice and a neural cell model of PTP1B overexpression. These findings suggest that increased forebrain PTP1B is associated with cognitive decline in obesity, whereas inhibition of PTP1B could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration induced by obesity.", "Keywords": ["Cognition", "Forebrain", "Obesity", "PTP1B", "Synapse"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Inflammation", "Leptin", "Obesity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Minmin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Menglu", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoli", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Jiangsu 221006, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute (IHMRI) and School of Medical, Indigenous, and Health, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Deqin", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Jiangsu 221006, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, Liaoning 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoying", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Huimei", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "HuiLongGuan Clinical Medical School, Beijing HuiLongGuan Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 10096, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "HuiLongGuan Clinical Medical School, Beijing HuiLongGuan Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 10096, China."}, {"First Name": "Danhong", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingxuan", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Jiangsu International Laboratory of Immunity and Metabolism, Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoying", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD 4113, Australia; Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Wacol, QLD, 4076, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510280, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuqing", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Anesthesiology, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Narcotic and Psychotropic Drugs, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China.

In this study, we developed an easy-to-implement method to create ultrathin Pt nanomembranes, which catalyze HER at a cost significantly lower than commercial Pt/C and comparable to non-noble metal electrocatalysts. These Pt nanomembranes consist of highly distorted Pt nanocrystals and exhibit a heterogeneous elastic strain field, a characteristic rarely seen in conventional crystals. This unique feature results in significantly higher electrocatalytic efficiency than various forms of Pt electrocatalysts, including Pt/C, Pt foils, and numerous Pt single-atom or single-cluster catalysts.

To understand changes in microbial communities and functional aspects of the tobacco phyllosphere after exposure to validamycin, the chemical was sprayed on tobacco leaves during brown spot epidemic periods caused by Alternaria alternata, and asymptomatic and symptomatic leaves of tobacco were sampled at different times (0\u2009day before, 5, 10, and 15\u2009days after application). The fungal and bacterial population diversity and structure were revealed using Illumina NovaSeq PE250 high-throughput sequencing technology, and Biolog-ECO technology which analyzes the metabolic differences between samples by using different carbon sources as the sole energy source. The results showed that the microbial community structure of both asymptomatic and symptomatic tobacco leaves changed after the application of valproate, with the microbial community structure of the asymptomatic tobacco leaves being more strongly affected than that of the symptomatic leaves, and the diversity of bacteria being greater than that of fungi. Phyllosphere fungal diversity in asymptomatic leaves increased significantly after application, and bacterial abundance and diversity in both asymptomatic and symptomatic leaves first increased and then decreased. Validamycin treatment effectively reduced the relative abundance of Alternaria, Cladosporium, Kosakonia, and Sphingomonas in leaves showing symptoms of tobacco brown spot, while the relative abundance of Thanatephorus, Pseudomonas, and Massilia increased significantly after application.

public health concern. Yet, the mechanisms through which symptomatology emerges remain poorly understood. While SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce prolonged inflammation within the central nervous system, the evidence primarily stems from limited small-scale case investigations. To address this gap, our study capitalized on longitudinal UK Biobank neuroimaging data acquired prior to and following COVID-19 testing (N\u00a0=\u00a0416 including n\u00a0=\u00a0224 COVID-19 cases; Mage\u00a0=\u00a058.6). Putative neuroinflammation was assessed in gray matter structures and white matter tracts using non-invasive Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI), which estimates inflammation-related cellularity (DBSI-restricted fraction; DBSI-RF) and vasogenic edema (DBSI-hindered fraction; DBSI-HF). We hypothesized that COVID-19 case status would be associated with increases in DBSI markers after accounting for potential confound (age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking frequency, and data acquisition interval) and multiple testing. COVID-19 case status was not significantly associated with DBSI-RF (|\u03b2|'s\u00a0<\u00a00.28, pFDR >0.05), but with greater DBSI-HF in left pre- and post-central gyri and right middle frontal gyrus (\u03b2's\u00a0>\u00a00.3, all pFDR\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Intriguingly, the brain areas exhibiting increased putative vasogenic edema had previously been linked to COVID-19-related functional and structural alterations, whereas brain regions displaying subtle differences in cellularity between COVID-19 cases and controls included regions within or functionally connected to the olfactory network, which has been implicated in COVID-19 psychopathology. Nevertheless, our study might not have captured acute and transitory neuroinflammatory effects linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly due to symptom resolution before the imaging scan.

In this study, an intermittently-aerated activated sludge system with iron-chitosan (Fe-CS) beads addition was proposed for nitrogen removal from low C/N wastewater. By adding Fe-CS beads, partial nitrification-denitrification (PND) process and significant enrichment of Paracoccus (with ability of iron reduction/ammonium oxidation/aerobic denitrification) were observed in the reactor. The accumulation rate of NO2--N reached 81.9 %, and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was improved to 93.9 % by shortening the aeration time. The higher activity of ammonium oxidizing bacteria and inhibited activity of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in Fe-CS assisted system mediated the occurrence of PND. In contrast, the traditional nitrification and denitrification process occurred in the control group. The high-throughput sequencing analysis and metagenomic results confirmed that the addition of Fe-CS induced 77.8 % and 54.9 % enrichment of Paracoccus in sludge and Fe-CS beads, respectively, while almost no enrichment was observed in control group. Furthermore, with the addition of Fe-CS beads, the expression of genes related to outer membrane porin, cytochrome c, and TCA was strengthened, thereby enhancing the electron transport of Fe(\u2161) (electron donor) and Fe(\u2162) (electron acceptor) with pollutants in the periplasm.

Dysfunction of CNS glia is associated with aging-related white matter diseases and neurodegeneration, and ciliopathies are known to affect CNS white matter. To investigate age-related changes in ciliary profile, we examined ciliary length and frequency in the retinogeniculate pathway, a white matter tract commonly affected by diseases of aging but in which expression of cilia has not been characterized. We found expression of Arl13b, a marker of primary cilia, in a small group of Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract in young and aged C57BL/6 wild-type mice. While the ciliary length and ciliated oligodendrocyte cells were constant in young mice in the retinogeniculate pathway, there was a significant increase in ciliary length in the anterior optic nerve as compared to the aged animals. Morphometric analysis confirmed a specific increase in the ciliation rate of CC1+ /Olig2+ oligodendrocytes in aged mice compared with young mice.

However, the poor treatment outcomes emphasize the need for effective treatment. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a vital component of the natural drug Astragalus, has anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and enhancing immune function. In this study, we found that APS effectively suppressed CRC development through activating CD8+ T cells and reversing its inhibitory state in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of AOM/DSS inflammation-induced CRC mice. Network pharmacology and clinical databases suggested that the STAT3/ Galectin-3(Gal-3)/LAG3 pathway might be APS's potential target for treating CRC and associated with CD8+ T cell dysfunction. In vivo experiments showed that APS significantly reduced phosphorylated STAT3 and Gal-3 levels in tumor cells, as well as LAG3 in CD8+ T cells. Co-culture experiments with MC38 and CD8+ T cells demonstrated that APS decreased the expression of co-inhibitory receptor LAG3 in CD8+ T cells by targeting STAT3/Gal-3 in MC38 cells. Mechanism investigations revealed that APS specifically improved CD8+ T cell function through modulation of the STAT3/Gal-3/LAG3 pathway to inhibit CRC development, providing insights for future clinical development of natural anti-tumor drugs and immunotherapies as a novel strategy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).", "Keywords": ["Astragalus Polysaccharide", "CD8(+) T cell dysfunction", "Colorectal cancer", "Galectin-3", "LAG3", "STAT3"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Inflammation", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Polysaccharides", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qiuyi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Chonghao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Guichuan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xuekai", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xinmei", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yalan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jiajing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yanfei", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China.

In identifying those differential expression genes monitored by Keap1\u03b1 and/or Keap1\u03b2, an unusual interaction of Keap1 with Smad2/3 was discovered by parsing transcriptome sequencing, Keap1-interacting protein profiling and relevant immunoprecipitation data.

The activation of Smad2/3 by Keap1, Keap1\u03b1 or Keap1\u03b2 was much likely contributable to a coordinative or another competitive effect of Nrf2, particularly in distinct Keap1-based cellular responses to its cognate growth factor (i.e. TGF-\u03b21) or redox stress (e.g. stimulated by tBHQ and DTT).

However, its thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, of WSe2 is limited due to its large lattice thermal conductivity (\u03baL) and low electrical conductivity. In view of WSe2 and MoS2 having the same crystal structure, here we designed and prepared Nb-doped quarternary mixed crystal (MC) Nb0.05W0.95-xMox(Se1-xSx)2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.095). The results indicate that the \u03baL of the MC can reach as low as 0.12 W m K-1 at 850 K, being 93% smaller than that of WSe2. Our analysis reveals that its low \u03baL originates chiefly from intense scattering of both high-frequency phonons from point defects (mainly alloying elements) and mid/low-frequency phonons from MoS2 inclusions residual within MC. In addition, the alloying of WSe2 with MoS2 causes a 5-fold increase in cation vacancies (VW\u2034'), leading to a large increase in hole concentration and electrical conductivity, which gives rise to a \u223c7.5 times increase in power factor (reaching 4.2 \u03bc W cm-1 K-2 at 850 K). As a result, a record high ZTmax = 0.63 is achieved at 850 K for the MC sample with x = 0.076, which is 20 times larger than that of WSe2, demonstrating that MC Nb0.05W0.95-xMox(Se1-xSx)2 is a promising thermoelectric material.", "Keywords": ["cation vacancy", "dislocations", "nanoinclusion", "phonon scattering", "point defect", "spark plasma sintering", "thermoelectric materials"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mazhar Hussain", "Last Name": "Danish", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Photovoltaic and Energy Conservation Materials, Institute of Solid State Physics, HFIPS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, P.

However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial-scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost-effective, environment-friendly and energy-efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP-assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6 ]4- /[Fe(CN)6 ]3- ) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6 ]4- to [Fe(CN)6 ]3- is low at 0.87\u2005V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6 ]3- to [Fe(CN)6 ]4- , thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6 ]4- /[Fe(CN)6 ]3- redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH\u2009\u22c5\u2009H2 O and FePO4 . The electrolyzer consumes 3.6\u2005kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300\u2005mA\u2009cm-2 , which is 43\u2009% less than conventional water electrolysis.

Methods: In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the mRNA expression level of CENPW in BLCA tissues and adjacent normal tissues using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Additionally, we investigated the association between CENPW expression and patient prognosis. Furthermore, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the impact of CENPW knockdown on various tumor biological phenotypes in BLCA. Finally, we conducted an analysis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenotypic alterations in BLCA. Results: The expression of CENPW was found to be upregulated in BLCA, and its higher expression was associated with a poorer disease-specific survival (DSS). CENPW was found to have close associations with the cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA replication. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the inhibition of CENPW led to a suppression of BLCA progression. Specifically, the knockdown of CENPW resulted in cell cycle arrest phase and induced apoptosis in BLCA by potentially inactivating the signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) signaling pathway.

However, generating stable animal models that accurately replicate the entire progression of atrial lesions, particularly the onset of AF, presents significant challenges. In the present study, we found that the isoform of CRE-binding protein modulator (CREM-Ib\u0394C-X), which is involved in the regulation of cardiac development and atrial rhythm, was highly expressed in atrial biopsies from patients with AF. Building upon this finding, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of CREM-Ib\u0394C-X (referred to as CS-CREM mice). This animal model effectively illustrated the development of ACM through electrophysiological and structural remodelings over time. Proteomics and Chip-qPCR analysis of atrial samples revealed significant upregulation of cell-matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix structural components, alongside significant downregulation of genes related to atrial functions in the CS-CREM mice. Furthermore, the corresponding responses to anti-arrhythmia drugs, i.e., amiodarone and propafenone, suggested that CS-CREM mice could serve as an ideal in vivo model for drug testing. Our study introduced a novel ACM model with spontaneous AF by cardiac-specifically overexpressing CREM-Ib\u0394C-X in mice, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of ACM.", "Keywords": ["Atrial cardiomyopathy", "Atrial fibrillation", "Atrial fibrosis", "CRISPR/Cas9", "Proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "Atrial Fibrillation", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Mice, Transgenic", "Heart Atria", "Cardiomyopathies", "Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiuzhou", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Huiyuan", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingzhe", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaojie", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingfang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiyu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongjin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongwu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, China.

We hypothesize that soft robotic exosuits can facilitate speed-based gait training at higher intensities and longer durations, resulting in a corresponding increase in circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Results: Eleven individuals >6-mo post-stroke completed a two-session, pilot randomized crossover trial (NCT05138016).

Herein, a cascade signal amplification of duplex-functional split-DNAzyme and dendritic probes was proposed for ultrasensitive and specific detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA on microfluidic microbead array chips. With the assistance of Pb2+, the duplex-functional split-DNAzyme recognizes EBV DNA and then rapidly cleaves the substrate strand. Subsequently, the released target could be recycled, and its exposed capture probe, triggered the dendritic enzyme-free signal amplification. As the enhanced mass transfer capability, target recycling, and dendritic DNA structure signal amplification inherent to microfluidic bead arrays were integrated, it achieved an excellent detection limit of 0.36\u00a0fM and a wide linear range of 1\u00a0fM\u223c103\u00a0fM. Further, it was applied to content detect simulated samples of EBV DNA, recovery ranged from 97.2\u00a0% to 108.1\u00a0%, and relative standard deviation (RSD) from 3.3\u00a0% to 5.9\u00a0%, exhibiting satisfactory recovery results.

However, it cannot improve the neurological disability of patients due to a lack of myelin protection and regeneration. Therefore, remyelinating therapies may be one of the feasible strategies that can prevent axonal degeneration and restore neurological disability. Natural product icariin (ICA) is a flavonol compound extracted from epimedium flavonoids, which has neuroprotective effects in several models of neurological diseases. Here, we attempt to explore whether ICA has the potential to treat demyelination and its possible mechanisms of action using lipopolysaccharide-treated BV2 microglia, primary microglia, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The indicators of oxidative stress and inflammatory response were evaluated using commercial kits. The results showed that ICA significantly reduced the levels of oxidative intermediates nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and increased the levels of antioxidants superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 in vitro cell experiments. In vivo demyelination model, ICA significantly alleviated the behavioral abnormalities and enhanced the integrated optical density/mm2 of Black Gold II and myelin basic protein myelin staining, accompanied by the inhibition of oxidative stress/inflammatory response. Immunohistochemical staining showed that ICA significantly induced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid derived 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) and inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4/ nuclear factor kappa B (TLR4/NF-\u03baB), which are two key signaling pathways in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes.

Dexamethasone has been shown to regulate inflammation and immune responses in sarcoidosis patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of dexamethasone regulating Th17/Treg balance in sarcoidosis remain elusive. Herein, we elucidated the function role of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in pulmonary sarcoidosis development and explored the underlying mechanism of dexamethasone in treating pulmonary sarcoidosis. We found that the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 pathway was inactivated in pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. Propionibacterium acnes (PA) induced mouse model was generated to investigate the function of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in vivo. Data indicated that IL17A inhibition with neutralizing antibody and activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling with SRI-011381 alleviated granuloma formation in the sarcoidosis mouse model. Moreover, we revealed that the Th17/Treg cell ratio was increased with PA treatment in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood. The concentration of cytokines produced by Th17 cells (IL-17A, IL-23) was up-regulated in the BALF of PA-treated mice, while those produced by Tregs (IL-10, TGF-\u03b21) presented significant reduction. The treatment of IL-17A neutralizing antibody or SRI-011381 was demonstrated to rescue the PA-induced changes in the concentration of IL-17A, IL-23, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b21.

Introduction of metal ions into pure organic systems can facilitate the phase transition from hydrogen-bonded structures to metal-organic structures by coordinating with organic molecules. However, it remains a challenge to attain a phase transition dominated by variable metal coordination configurations through adjustment of the metal ion concentration. Herein, we report the phase transitions of naphthalene-2,3-carbonitride (2,3-DCN) molecules on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) under varying solvents and Cu2+ ion concentrations. By integrating data from scanning tunneling microscopy imaging and density functional theory calculations, it is demonstrated that phase transitions of 2,3-DCN occur through forming diverse coordination configurations where Cu2+ ions can coordinate with 2,3-DCN and 1-nonanoic acid or Cl- ions to form different ligand components with a coordination number of 4 when varying the molar ratios of 2,3-DCN to Cu2+ ion in the 1-nonanoic acid solvent. However, in the case of 1-heptanoic acid as a solvent, the self-assembly structure of 2,3-DCN only changes via the alteration of hydrogen bonding sites and Cu2+ ions do not coordinate with 2,3-DCN molecules. These findings provide valuable insights into the coordination behavior of metal ions in different solvents.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Longnan", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Sihao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhongping", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingming", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Changgang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China."}], "Journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "PubDate": "2024Jan09"}, {"PMID": "38154089", "Title": "Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate Using a Ruthenium-Copper Cocatalyst System: A Full Concentration Range Study.", "Abstract": "Electrochemical synthesis of ammonia via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been intensively researched as an alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process.

The use of a concentrated electrolyte (\u22651 M) for higher rate production is hampered by poor hydrogen transfer kinetics.

Detailed mechanistic studies by deuterium labeling and operando Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy allow us to probe the hydrogen transfer rate and intermediate species on Ru/Cu2O. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that adsorbed hydroxide on Ru nanoparticles increases the density of the hydrogen-bonded water network near the Cu2O surface, which promotes the hydrogen transfer rate.

disease (AD) is crucial for developing potential therapeutic treatments. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a well-established tool used to detect \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain. Previous studies have shown that cross-sectional biomarkers can predict cognitive decline (Schindler et al.,2021). However, it is still unclear whether longitudinal A\u03b2-PET may have additional value for predicting time to cognitive impairment in AD. The current study aims to evaluate the ability of baseline- versus longitudinal rate of change in-11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) A\u03b2-PET to predict cognitive decline. A cohort of 153 participants who previously underwent PiB-PET scans and comprehensive clinical assessments were used in this study. Our analyses revealed that baseline A\u03b2 is significantly associated with the rate of change in cognitive composite scores, with cognition declining more rapidly when baseline PiB A\u03b2 levels were higher. In contrast, no signification association was identified between the rate of change in PiB-PET A\u03b2 and cognitive decline. Additionally, the ability of the rate of change in the PiB-PET measures to predict cognitive decline was significantly influenced by APOE \u03b54 carrier status. These results suggest that a single PiB-PET scan is sufficient to predict cognitive decline and that longitudinal measures of A\u03b2 accumulation do not improve the prediction of cognitive decline once someone is amyloid positive.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Amyloid", "Cognition", "Longitudinal study", "PET"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Brain", "Biomarkers", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Longitudinal Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gengsheng", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA;

Multivariate regression logistic analysis showed that exercise (P\u2009=\u2009.019, odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.494, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.274-0.891), intellectual activity (P\u2009=\u2009.019, OR\u2009=\u20090.595, 95% CI: 0.380-0.932), medication use (P\u2009=\u2009.003, OR\u2009=\u20092.388, 95% CI: 1.339-4.258), chronic pain (P\u2009=\u2009.003, OR\u2009=\u20091.580, 95% CI: 1.013-2.465) and loneliness (P\u2009=\u2009.000, OR\u2009=\u20092.991, 95% CI: 1.728-5.175) were significantly associated with CF in community residents; however, only sedentary behavior (P\u2009=\u2009.013, OR\u2009=\u20093.851, 95% CI: 1.328-11.170) was significantly associated with CF in nursing home residents.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural polyphenol that exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative benefits in skin wounds, however, the direct effect of EGCG on epidermal keratinocytes, the primary cells required for re-epithelialization in wound healing remains unknown. Our study aims to examine the underlying mechanisms of EGCG's ability to promote re-epithelialization and wound healing in T2D-induced wounds. Murine models of wound healing in T2D were established via feeding high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD) and the creation of full-thickness wounds. Mice were administered daily with EGCG or vehicle to examine the wound healing response and underlying molecular mechanisms of EGCG's protective effects. Systemic administration of EGCG in T2D mice robustly accelerated the wound healing response following injury. EGCG induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and promoted cytokeratin 16 (K16) expression to activate epidermal keratinocytes and robustly promoted re-epithelialization of wounds in diabetic mice. Further, EGCG demonstrated high binding affinity with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), thereby inhibiting KEAP1-mediated degradation of NRF2. Our findings provide important evidence that EGCG accelerates the wound healing response in diabetic mice by activating epidermal keratinocytes, thereby promoting re-epithelialization of wounds via K16/NRF2/KEAP1 signaling axis.

In 2022, a suspected outbreak of TMUV occurred at a goose farm located in Anhui Province. A strain of TMUV, TMUV HQ-22, was isolated from the infected geese. Phylogenetic analysis using the E gene of the HQ-22 strain demonstrated its affiliation with cluster 3, a less commonly reported cluster in comparison to the main circulating cluster, cluster 2. Through a comparison of the envelope (E) protein of HQ-22 with other typical TMUV strains, a mutation at the 157th amino acid position was identified, wherein valine (V) in cluster 3 changed to alanine (A), a characteristic that is unique to cluster 2. These findings highlight the diversity and complexity of the TMUV strains circulating in China. In our experimental analysis, an injection of TMUV HQ-22 into the muscles of 3-day-old goslings resulted in severe neurological symptoms and a mortality rate of 60%. Similarly, the intracranial or intranasal infection of 3-week-old ICR mice with TMUV HQ-22 led to severe neurological symptoms and respective mortality rates of 100% or 10%. In summary, our study isolated a TMUV strain, TMUV HQ-22, from geese that belongs to cluster 3 and exhibits significant pathogenicity in both goslings and ICR mice. These results emphasize the genetic diversity of the TMUV circulating in China and expand the host range beyond mosquitoes to include ducks, chickens, geese, and even mice.

Cancer metastasis is the main cause of poor prognosis in HNC patients. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), initially thought to have no biological function, are attracting increasing attention, and their crucial roles in mediating HNC metastasis are being extensively investigated. Existing studies have shown that circRNAs primarily function through miRNA sponges, transcriptional regulation, interacting with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and as translation templates. Among these functions, the function of miRNA sponge is the most prominent. In this review, we summarized the reported circRNAs involved in HNC metastasis, aiming to elucidate the regulatory relationship between circRNAs and HNC metastasis. Furthermore, we summarized the latest advances in the epidemiological information of HNC metastasis and the tumor metastasis theories, the biogenesis, characterization and functional mechanisms of circRNAs, and their potential clinical applications.

significant attention in the fields of antibacterial activity and pollutant degradation due to its well-known photocatalytic properties. However, the application of TiO2 is significantly limited by its large band gap width, which only allows excitation by ultraviolet light below 400 nm. Here, we propose the use of surface chiral functionalization of TiO2 to tune its band gap width, thus enabling it to be excited by near-infrared-region light (NIR), resulting in the effective separation of electron-hole pairs. By controlling the solvent polarity and forming numerous weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonding) between chiral ligands and TiO2, we successfully prepared chiral TiO2 superparticles (SPs) that exhibited a broad circular dichroism (CD) absorption at 792 nm. Under circularly polarized light (CPL) at 808 nm, the chiral SPs induced the separation of electron-hole pairs in TiO2, thus generating hydroxyl and singlet oxygen radicals. Antibacterial tests under CPL in NIR showed that the chiral TiO2 SPs exhibited excellent antibacterial performance, with inhibition rates of 99.4% and 100% against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Recycling-reuse experiments and biocompatibility evaluation of the material demonstrated that the chiral TiO2 SPs are stable and safe antibacterial materials, thus indicating the potential application of chiral TiO2 SPs in antibacterial aspects of medical implants.", "Keywords": ["TiO2, superparticles", "antibacterial", "chiral", "near-infrared circularly polarized light"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Positive Bacteria", "Ultraviolet Rays", "Titanium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Changlong", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Liguang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xinxin", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital, Jiangnan University, No. 1000, Hefeng Road, Wuxi, Jiangsu, 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Maozhong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Wuxi Neurosurgical Institute, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214002, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Kuang", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Chuanlai", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Biointerface and Biodetection, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "ACS nano", "PubDate": "2024Jan09"}, {"PMID": "38112061", "Title": "Post-marketing safety surveillance study of a 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in individuals aged 16-26 years in Chongqing, China.", "Abstract": "The safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, one of the major challenges to public vaccination, has been controversial.

However, the mechanism of PCV2 and G. parasuis serotype 4 (GPS4) co-infection is still not fully understood. In this study, swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used as a barrier model, and our results showed that PCV2 infection increased the adhesion of GPS4 to STEC, while decreasing the levels of ZO-1, Occludin and increasing tracheal epithelial permeability, and ultimately facilitated GPS4 translocation. Snail1 is a transcriptional repressor, and has been known to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during development or in cancer metastasis. Importantly, we found that Snail1, as a transcriptional repressor, was crucial in destroying the tracheal epithelial barrier induced by PCV2, GPS4, PCV2 and GPS4 coinfection. For the first time, we found that PCV2, GPS4, PCV2 and GPS4 coinfection cross-activates TGF-\u03b2 and p38/MAPK signaling pathways to upregulate the expression of Snail1, down-regulate the levels of ZO-1 and Occludin, and thus disrupt the integrity of tracheal epithelial barrier then promoting GPS4 translocation. Finally, PCV2 and GPS4 co-infection also can activate TGF-\u03b2 and p38/MAPK signaling pathways in vivo and upregulate Snail1, ultimately down-regulating the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin.

As the persistent need regarding the sex balance of neuroscience research and female-specific pathology of mental disorders surges, the establishment of natural etiology-based and systematically validated animal paradigms for depression with female subjects becomes an urgent scientific problem. This study aims to establish, characterize, and validate a \"Multiple Integrated Social Stress (MISS)\" model of depression in female C57BL/6J mice by manipulating and integrating daily social stressors that females are experiencing. Female C57BL/6J mice randomly experienced social competition failure in tube test, modified vicarious social defeat stress, unescapable overcrowding stress followed by social isolation on each day, for ten consecutive days. Compared with their controls, female MISS mice exhibited a relatively decreased preference for social interaction and sucrose, along with increased immobility in the tail suspension test, which could last for at least one month. These MISS mice also exhibited increased levels of blood serum corticosterone, interleukin-6\u00a0L and 1\u03b2. In the pharmacological experiment, MISS-induced dysfunctions in social interaction, sucrose preference, and tail suspension tests were amended by systematically administrating a single dose of sub-anesthetic ketamine, a rapid-onset antidepressant. Compared with controls, MISS females exhibited decreased c-Fos activation in their anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and some other depression-related brain regions. Furthermore, 24\u00a0h after the last exposure to the paradigm, MISS mice demonstrated a decreased center zone time in the open field test and decreased open arm time in the elevated plus-maze test, indicating anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes. Interestingly, MISS mice developed an excessive nesting ability, suggesting a likely behavioral phenotype of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These data showed that the MISS paradigm was sufficient to generate pathological profiles in female mice to mimic core symptoms, serum biochemistry and neural adaptations of depression in clinical patients.

However, in seasonally frozen salinization regions, hydraulic engineering is prone to deformation failure. Leakage from canal raises the regional groundwater level, triggering secondary salinization environmental issues. Exploring the instability mechanisms is thus necessary for hydraulic engineering. Traditional deformation monitoring techniques and soil experiments are constrained by observation scale and timeliness. In this study, Sentinel-1B data from November 2017 to August 2019 were acquired. The small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR approach was employed to interpret the seasonal deformation characteristics in both the vertical and slope directions of a damaged canal segment in Songyuan, Northeast China. The mechanical properties of saline-alkali soil under varying water contents were quantified by integrating unconfined compression experiment (UCE). In May, as the soil thawed downward, a frozen lenses with poor permeability formed at a depth of approximately 100\u00a0cm, causing the accumulation of meltwater and infiltrated precipitation between the frozen layer and the melting layer in the canal. The soil water content at a depth of 80 to 140\u00a0cm exceeded 22\u00a0%, reaching a threshold for rapid reduction in unconfined compression strength (UCS). Consequently, in spring, the low soil strength between the frozen layer and the melting layer resulted in interface sliding, with a displacement of -133.88\u00a0mm in the canal slope direction. Furthermore, the differential projection of freeze-thaw deformation in the slope direction caused continuous creep of the canal towards the free face, with a value of -23.27\u00a0mm, exacerbating the formation of the late spring landslide. Integrating InSAR and engineering geological analysis is beneficial for addressing deformation issues in hydraulic engineering.

In addition, this atlas revealed a LIM homeobox transcription factor code that parcellates the reticulospinal neurons into five molecularly distinct and spatially segregated populations.

Apoptosis is a critical adaptive response essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and defending against environmental threats. In this study, bay scallops Argopecten irradians irradians were exposed to multiple antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, norfloxacin, and erythromycin, each at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) combined with/without acidic seawater (pH 7.6) for 35 days. The single and interactive effects of the two stressors on apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms in hemocytes of A. irradians irradians were determined through flow cytometry analysis, comet assay, oxidative stress biomarkers analysis, and transcriptome analysis. Results showed that apoptosis could be triggered by either AM exposure or OA exposure, but through different pathways. Exposure to AM leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage, which in turn triggers apoptosis via a series of cellular events in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Conversely, while OA exposure similarly induced apoptosis, its effects are comparatively subdued and are predominantly mediated through the intrinsic pathway. Additionally, the synergistic effects of AM and OA exposure induced pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damages in the hemocytes of A. irradians irradians. Despite the evident cellular distress and the potential initiation of apoptotic pathways, the actual execution of apoptosis appears to be restrained, which might be attributed to an energy deficit within the hemocytes. Our findings underscore the constrained tolerance capacity of A. irradians irradians when faced with multiple environmental stressors, and shed light on the ecotoxicity of antibiotic pollution in the ocean under prospective climate change scenarios.", "Keywords": ["Antibiotics residues", "Apoptosis", "Bay scallop", "Ocean acidification"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Seawater", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Hemocytes", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Ecosystem", "Ocean Acidification", "Prospective Studies", "Pectinidae", "Apoptosis", "Mitochondrial Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qianqian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dinglong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoli", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhijun", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiutang", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; Key Laboratory of Coastal Zone Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China.

This study integrated network analysis and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to convert indicator interlinkages into indicator weights and then assessed the aggregate performance of the SDGs. Subsequently, the prioritized provinces and indicators were identified at the subnational level of China based on the aggregate performance of the SDGs, SDG growth rate and indicator interlinkages. The per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), and the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) were the most contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs, while the common challenges dealt with SDG 16, SDG 6, SDG 7 and SDG 12. Moreover, accelerating the development of western provinces would make it possible to overcome the traditional imbalance status, while resource-driven provinces should be paid special attention due to their poor aggregate performance of the SDGs and their lower growth rate.

No studies have been conducted concerning the oxidative degradation of PFASs and/or CAHs by in situ thermally activated persulfate (TAP) in groundwater, primarily due to the difficulty in cost-effectively achieving the desired temperature in the field. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of PFASs degradation by in situ TAP at a site with PFASs and CAHs co-contaminants were investigated. The target temperature of 40.0-70.0\u00a0\u00b0C was achieved in groundwater, and persulfate was effectively distributed in the demonstration area - the combination of which ensured the degradation of PFASs and CAHs co-contaminants by in situ TAP. It was demonstrated that the reductions of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) concentration in all monitoring wells were in the range of 43.7\u00a0%-66.0\u00a0% by in situ TAP compared to those maximum rebound values in groundwater, whereas no effective perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) degradation was observed. The conversion of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) precursors was one of the main factors leading to the increase in PFCAs concentrations in groundwater during in situ TAP.

Aurantiochytrium sp. has gained notoriety because of its ability to accumulate high-value docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), but the key factors of DHA synthesis were unclear at present. In this study, Atmospheric and Room Temperature Plasma technology was applied to the mutagenic breeding of Aurantiochytrium sp., and transcriptomics and proteomics were adopted to analyze the DHA-biosynthesis mechanism. According to the growth and DHA accumulation profiles, the mutant strain Aurantiochytrium sp. R2A35 was selected. The DHA content in total lipids was greatly improved from 49.39\u00a0% of the wild strain R2 to 63.69\u00a0% of the mutant strain. Moreover, the DHA content in the biomass of Aurantiochytrium sp. R2A35 as 39.72\u00a0% was the highest DHA productivity reported so far. The differentially expressed genes distinguished from transcriptome and the TMT-identified differential proteins distinguished from proteome confirmed that the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ketoacyl reductase was up-regulated by 4.78-fold and 6.95-fold, respectively and the fatty acid synthase was concurrently down-regulated by 2.79-fold, so that more precursor was transported to the polyketide synthase pathway, thereby increasing the DHA yield in Aurantiochytrium sp.

In order to address this critical problem, this study proposes the synergistic preparation of geopolymers utilizing RM in conjunction with another industrial waste, rice husk ash (RHA). Geopolymers with varying incorporation of RHA were prepared using sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate composite alkaline activator. The mechanical properties, microstructure, and environmental characteristics of geopolymers were investigated. The incorporation of RHA significantly enhanced the strength of RM-based geopolymers, with the highest strength of 25.40\u00a0MPa achieved at 40% incorporation. According to XRD patterns and FTIR spectra, C-(A)-S-H and N-(A)-S-H were generated during the geopolymerization, thereby enhancing the strength of geopolymers. From SEM micrographs of geopolymers, it was evident that the geopolymer matrix was constituted by the encapsulation of unreacted inert particles of RM and residual fragments of RHA with C-(A)-S-H and N-(A)-S-H. The leaching levels of trace elements and heavy metals in geopolymers are both below the regulatory thresholds, thereby effectively mitigating the presence of hazardous substances in raw materials.

As-s displayed clear hemolysis, amylase, and positive catalase activities, and grew at a wide range of temperatures (10-37 \u00b0C) and pH values (5.5-8.5). As-s was highly sensitive to cefuroxime sodium, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and cefoperazone and also apparently sensitive to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and 25% cinnamaldehyde. The Virulence array protein gene cloning' results suggested that As-s has this gene compared with the other two vapA-containing strains, despite a close relationship of these strains via phylogenetic analysis. Severe ulcers on skin, muscle, and abnormal liver, and hemorrhage in pectoral/ventral fins and anal region were observed, and exophthalmos were also noticed in infected juvenile snakehead, as well as necrosis and infiltration of blood cells emerged in the internal organs using pathological section.

Antibiotic pollution and ocean acidification are two prevalently concurrent environmental stressors. Yet their interactive effects on marine biota have not been investigated adequately and the compound hazard remain obscure. In this study, bay scallops Argopecten irradians irradians were exposed to multiple antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, norfloxacin, and erythromycin, each at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) combined with/without acidic seawater (pH\u00a07.6) for 35\u00a0days. The single and interactive effects of the two stressors on A. irradians irradians were determined from multidimensional bio-responses, including energetic physiological traits as well as the molecular underpinning (metabolome and expressions of key genes). Results showed that multiple antibiotics predominantly enhanced the process of DNA repair and replication via disturbing the purine metabolism pathway. This alternation is perhaps to cope with the DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. Ocean acidification mainly disrupted energy metabolism and ammonia metabolism of the scallops, as evidenced by the increased ammonia excretion rate, the decreased O:N ratio, and perturbations in amino acid metabolism pathways. Moreover, the antagonistic effects of multiple antibiotics and ocean acidification caused alternations in the relative abundance of neurotransmitter and gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors, which may lead to neurological disorders in scallops. Overall, the revealed alternations in physiological traits, metabolites and gene expressions provide insightful information for the health status of bivalves in a natural environmental condition under the climate change scenarios.", "Keywords": ["Antibiotics residues", "Bay scallop", "Metabolomics", "Ocean acidification", "Physiological response"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Ammonia", "Ocean Acidification", "Seawater", "Pectinidae", "Metabolome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qianqian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dinglong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoli", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhijun", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003, PR China; Muping Coastal Environmental Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China; Key Laboratory of Coastal Zone Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264117, PR China.

The manipulation of the surface structure of the evaporator markedly promotes the enhancement of light capture and the improvement of evaporation performance. Herein, inspired by seedless lotus pod, a flexible pristine polypyrrole (PPy) membrane with macro/micro-bubble and nanotube asymmetric structure is fabricated through template-assisted interfacial polymerization. The macro- and micro-hierarchical structure of the open bubbles enable multiple reflections inner and among the bubble cavities for enhanced light trapping and omnidirectional photothermal conversion. In addition, the multilevel structure (macro/micro/nano) of the asymmetric PPy (PPy-A) membrane induces water evaporation in the form of clusters, leading to a reduction of water evaporation enthalpy. The PPy-A membranes achieve a full-spectrum light absorption of 96.3% and high evaporation rate of 2.03\u00a0kg\u00a0m-2 \u00a0h-1 under 1 sun. Long-term stable desalination is also verified with PPy-A membranes by applying one-way water channel.

Our approach leverages the Epipolar Focus Spectrum (EFS) representation, which models the LF in the transformed spatial-focus domain, avoiding the dependence on the scene depth and providing a high-quality basis for dense LF reconstruction. Previous EFS-based LF reconstruction methods learn the cross-view, occlusion, depth and shearing terms simultaneously, which makes the training difficult due to stability and convergence problems and further results in limited reconstruction performance for challenging scenarios. To address this issue, we conduct a theoretical study on the transformation between the EFSs derived from one LF with sparse and dense angular samplings, and propose that a dense EFS can be decomposed into a linear combination of the EFS of the sparse input, the sheared EFS, and a high-order occlusion term explicitly. The devised learning-based framework with the input of the under-sampled EFS and its sheared version provides high-quality reconstruction results, especially in large disparity areas. Comprehensive experimental evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially achieves at most dB advantages in reconstructing scenes containing thin structures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yaning", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guoqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38016555", "Title": "Effects of short and long-term thermal exposure on microbial compositions in soils contaminated with mixed benzene and benzo[a]pyrene: A short communication.", "Abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) are the most persistent and toxic organic contaminants often found co-contaminated in anthropogenic and petrochemical industrial sites. Therefore, an experiment was performed for the safe biodegradation of benzene and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) through thermally-enhanced biodegradation, and to explore the influence of elevated thermal treatments on microbial diversity and composition. The results revealed that elevated thermal treatments (15 to 45\u00a0\u00b0C) significantly enhanced the diversity of both bacteria and fungi. The composition analysis revealed that short-term and long-term elevated temperature conditions can directly enhance the specificity of microorganisms that play a crucial role in the biodegradation of benzene and BaP co-contaminated soil. Moreover, the indirect role of elevated temperature conditions on microbial compositions was through the fluctuations of soil properties, especially soil pH, moisture, TOC, potassium, phosphorous, total Fe, Fe(II), and Fe(III). In addition, the correlation analyses revealed that thermal exposure enhances the synergistic association (fungal-fungal, fungal-bacterial, bacterial-bacterial) of microbes to degrade the toxic contaminants and to cope with harsh environmental conditions.

However, dynamic alterations and dysfunction of resting-state networks (RSNs) in MDD patients with suicidality have remained unclear. Thus, we investigated whether subjects with different severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior may have different disturbances in brain RSNs and whether these changes could be used as the diagnostic biomarkers to discriminate MDD with or without suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Then a multicenter, cross-sectional study of 528 MDD patients with or without suicidality and 998 healthy controls was performed. We defined the probability of dying by the suicide of the suicidality components as a 'suicidality gradient'. We constructed ten RSNs, including default mode (DMN), subcortical (SUB), ventral attention (VAN), and visual network (VIS). The network connections of RSNs were analyzed among MDD patients with different suicidality gradients and healthy controls using ANCOVA, chi-squared tests, and network-based statistical analysis. And support vector machine (SVM) model was designed to distinguish patients with mild-to-severe suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior. We found the following abnormalities with increasing suicidality gradient in MDD patients: within-network connectivity values initially increased and then decreased, and one-versus-other network values decreased first and then increased. Besides, within- and between-network connectivity values of the various suicidality gradients are mainly negatively correlated with HAMD anxiety and positively correlated with weight. We found that VIS and DMN-VIS values were affected by age (p\u2009<\u20090.05), cingulo-opercular network, and SUB-VAN values were statistically influenced by sex (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the SVM model could distinguish MDD patients with different suicidality gradients (AUC range, 0.73-0.99). In conclusion, we have identified that disrupted brain connections were present in MDD patients with different suicidality gradient.

Employing nano-sized NaY seeds and an ultra-dilute reaction solution with a molar composition of 80 Na2O: 1Al2O3: 19 SiO2: 5000H2O, the effects of synthesis temperature, crystallization time, and porous support (\u03b1-Al2O3 or mullite) on the formation of FAU membranes were investigated. The results illustrated that further extending the crystallization time or increasing the synthesis temperature led to the formation of a NaP impurity phase on the FAU membrane layer. The most promising FAU membrane with a thickness of 2.7 \u00b5m was synthesized on an \u03b1-Al2O3 support at 368 K for 8 h and had good reproducibility.

However, conventional surface defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies, OVs), featured with the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, often favor the reduction of O2 to \u2022O2- rather than O22- via two-electron transfer, hindering the efficient pollutant removal with high electron utilization. Herein, we demonstrate that this bottleneck can be well discharged by modulating the electronic structure of OVs via phosphorization. As a proof of concept, TiO2 nanoparticles are adopted as a model material for NaH2PO2 (HP) modification, in which HP induces the formation of OVs via weakening the Ti-O bonds through the hydrogen bond interactions. Additionally, the formed Ti-O-P covalent bond refines the electronic structure of OVs, which enables rapid electron transfer for two-electron molecular oxygen activation. As exemplified by NO oxidation, HP-modified TiO2 with abundant OVs achieved complete NO removal with high selectivity for benign nitrate, superior to that of pristine TiO2. This study highlights a promising approach to regulate the O2 activation via an electronic structure modulation and provides fresh insights into the rational design of a photocatalyst for environmental remediation.", "Keywords": ["NO oxidation", "O2 activation", "defect engineering", "electronic structure modulation", "hydrogen bond", "photocatalysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Oxygen", "Electrons", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Oxidation-Reduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "School of Materials and Chemistry, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai 200093, P.

The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanisms of IBU damage to the ovary and drugs to combat it. We established in vivo (IBU doses of 50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg-day) and in vitro (IBU concentrations of 50, 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcM in culture medium) models of ovarian damage in mice simulating clinical doses and found that IBU not only caused ovarian damage in mice in a dose-response relationship, but also decreased estradiol (E2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in serum/media with increasing IBU doses. In damaged ovaries, the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)-PGE2 pathway is inhibited, the Hippo pathway is activated, circPVT1 is decreased, and miR-149 is elevated. TT-10 is an activator of YES-associated protein (YAP)-transcriptional enhancer factor domain activity.

TT-10 also inhibited the Hippo pathway, activated the COX2-PGE2 pathway, elevated circPVT1 expression, and decreased miR-149 expression in the ovary.

An empirical study based on CHFS data.", "Abstract": "Based on China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data from 2019, this paper explores the impact of the residential pattern of coresidence with parents on the labor market performance of women in married families with minor children. The study finds that coresidence with parents significantly increases the possibility of female labor market participation and positively impacts women's employment income. To overcome the potential endogeneity problem of residential patterns, this paper uses the Heckman two-step method and the conditional mixed process estimation method (CMP method) for regression, and the conclusions remain robust. The mechanism analysis shows that coresidence with parents has both grandchild care and elderly care factors, which have a spillover effect and a crowding-out effect on female labor market performance, respectively. Since the spillover effect is more significant than the crowding-out effect, coresidence with parents positively impacts women's labor market performance. The heterogeneity analysis shows that in terms of labor force participation rate, coresidence with parents has a more significant impact on women in families with children aged 0-6, women in families without boys, and women in families with employed husbands. In terms of income, coresidence with parents has a more significant impact on women in families with employed husbands.

However, non-continuous field sampling data makes it difficult to meet the needs of scientific research and pollution control of marine MPs. Consequently, the development of rapid monitoring techniques for marine MPs to achieve efficient acquisition of data is increasingly essential. Remote sensing technology provides a convenient and effective tool for monitoring and mapping marine MPs pollution. Therefore, we established an inversion model based on multiple regression by combining the remote sensing data and the measured data to predict the MPs pollution status in the Bohai Sea. The feature variables of a model are crucial to the prediction, and we proposed three methods of variable selection, namely successive projections algorithm (SPA), band combination method, and remote sensing index method. By comparing accuracy evaluation metrics, an approach based on SPA was selected to analyze the abundance and spatio-temporal distribution of MPs in the Bohai Sea in 2022. The determination coefficient of the SPA model is 0.75, and the root mean square error is 0.38 items/m3. The error of the model is within an acceptable range. It was found that the MPs abundance on the sea surface of the Bohai Sea varied significantly in different seasons and regions.

Here, we choose Fe and Co as DAC models and study types, contents, molar ratios of two precursors, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The Fe,Co DACs were synthesized by an adsorption-annealing approach, using nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (NC) as the support. As a result, the adsorption ability of metal precursors on the support determines the metal loadings in Fe and Co DACs, leading to differences in ORR performance. The Fe precursors win the adsorption competitions in most cases, resulting in a much higher loading than that of Co precursors. Importantly, it is difficult to increase the precursor content by simply increasing the initial amount. Choosing the right combination of metal precursors, such as ferrocene and cobalt chloride, can yield Fe,Co DACs with enhanced ORR performance..", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Genlin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiafang", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengwei", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Catalysis, Hokkaido University, Kita 21-10, Sapporo 001-0021, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Guangbo", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry and Food Chemistry &; Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (cfaed), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden 01062, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Yazhou", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, China."}], "Journal": "ACS omega", "PubDate": "2023Nov07"}, {"PMID": "37969391", "Title": "The transcription activity of OTX2 on p16 expression is significantly blocked by methylation of CpG shore in non-promoter of lung cancer cell lines.", "Abstract": "The aberrant expression of the classical tumor suppressor gene p16 is a frequent event in lung cancer mainly due to the hypermethylation of its 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' island (Cgi).

Our investigation begins with an exploration of rotator cuff injuries, common musculoskeletal disorders that severely impair shoulder functionality and quality of life. These injuries are notably pervasive among sports enthusiasts and the older adult, with an incidence rate estimated at 5-10% in the general population. Despite their widespread occurrence and the diverse, multifactorial etiological factors, effective treatment strategies remain elusive. We then examine hyperlipidemia, a metabolic disorder affecting approximately 40% of the global adult population. Characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, hyperlipidemia can precipitate severe cardiovascular complications and presents a significant socioeconomic burden. Although current management strategies encompass lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, the condition remains a formidable health challenge. Central to this review is the exploration of a potential association between hyperlipidemia and rotator cuff injuries. We aim to synthesize the current understanding of hyperlipidemia's role in the pathophysiology of rotator cuff injuries, thereby offering fresh insights into their common etiological underpinnings, potential therapeutic targets, and drugs, such as Statins. The influence of other lipid-lowering therapeutics on tendon health is also considered, and further research into the molecular pathways and potential therapeutic benefits of these drugs is required.

In particular, we make the first direct comparison of the balancing weights, inverse probability weighting and OR methods for estimating the effects of continuous exposures on time-to-event outcomes in simulations and demonstrate that these methods can exhibit markedly different behaviours that subsequently lead to a change in the conclusions. To improve weighted exposure effect estimators, we also propose a new simple-to-apply diagnostic to detect when such estimators might be subject to severe bias, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations.

key to conquering the\"polysulfide shuttle effects\" by accelerating the polysulfide conversion. Since the process involves solid-liquid-solid multistep phase transitions, purposely-engineered heterostructure catalysts with various active regions for catalyzing conversion steps correspondingly are beneficial to promote the overall conversion process. However, the functionalities of the materials surface and interface in heterostructure catalysts remain unclear. In this work, an Mo2C/MoC catalyst with abundant Mo2C surface-interface-MoC surface tri-active-region is developed by in situ converting the MoZn-metal organic framework. The experimental and simulation studies demonstrate the interface can catch long-chain polysulfides and promote their conversion. Instead, the Mo2C and MoC tend to accommodate the short-chain polysulfide and accelerate their conversion and the Li2S dissociation. Benefitting from the high catalytic ability, the Li-S battery assembled with the Mo2C/MoC-S cathode shows more discrete redox reactions and delivers a high initial capacity of 1603.6 mAh g-1 at 1 C charging-discharging rate, which is over twofolds of the one assembled using individual hosts, and 80.4% capacity can be maintained after 1000 cycles at 3 C rate.

However, the antimicrobial mechanism of MITC against F. oxysporum, especially at the transcriptional level, is still unclear. In this experiment, the antimicrobial mechanism of MITC against F. oxysporum was investigated. Our results indicated that when F. oxysporum was exposed to 6\u00a0mg/L MITC for 12\u00a0h, the inhibitory rate of MITC on F. oxysporum was 80%. Transmission electron microscopes showed that the cell wall and membrane of F. oxysporum had shrunk and folded, vacuoles increased, and mitochondria swelled and deformed. In addition, the enzyme activity of F. oxysporum treated with MITC showed a decrease of 32.50%, 8.28% and 74.04% in catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing of F. oxysporum was performed and the results showed that 1478 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were produced in response to MITC exposure. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs identified were involved in substance and energy metabolism, signal transduction, transport and catalysis. MITC disrupted cell homeostasis by influencing the expression of some key genes involved in chitin synthase and detoxification enzymes production, but F. oxysporum also protected itself by up-regulating genes involved in energy synthesis (such as upregulating acnA, CS and LSC2 in TCA). qRT-PCR data validated the reliability of transcriptome data. Our research used biochemical and genetic techniques to identify molecular lesions in the mycelia of F. oxysporum exposed to MITC, and provide valuable insights into the toxic mechanism of pathogenic fungi mediated by MITC.

Autophagy is pivotal in cellular responses to pathogens and in viral pathogenesis. However, little is known about the roles of autophagy in DTMUV replication and viral pathogenesis, especially in neuropathogenesis. In this study, mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a) were used to establish a cell model of DTMUV infection. Our experiments indicated that DTMUV infection induced incomplete autophagy in Neuro-2a cells. Then, we used different autophagy regulators to alter the autophagy induced by DTMUV and found that incomplete autophagy promoted DTMUV replication. Furthermore, we showed that DTMUV infection activated the ERK and AMPK pathways, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of the autophagy repressor mTOR, subsequently leading to autophagic induction. In addition, we utilized ICR mice in an animal model of DTMUV infection to evaluate the autophagic responses in brain tissues and investigate the effects of autophagy on viral replication and tissue lesions. Our results confirmed that DTMUV induced incomplete autophagy in mouse brain tissues and that autophagy inducer treatment promoted DTMUV replication and aggravated DTMUV-induced lesions, whereas autophagy inhibitor treatment had the opposite effects. In summary, DTMUV infection induced incomplete autophagy through the ERK/mTOR and AMPK/mTOR signalling pathways to promote viral replication in mouse neuronal cells, and DTMUV-induced incomplete autophagy contributed to the neuropathogenesis of DTMUV.", "Keywords": ["Duck Tembusu virus", "incomplete autophagy", "neuropathogenesis", "signalling pathways", "viral replication"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Flavivirus Infections", "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Mice, Inbred ICR", "Flavivirus", "Virus Replication", "Ducks", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Autophagy", "Poultry Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaqian", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Guangbin", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Weiping", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuyue", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Guijun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China. wgj2018@ahau.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Veterinary research", "PubDate": "2023Nov07"}, {"PMID": "37936104", "Title": "GCN5L1 regulates pulmonary surfactant production by modulating lamellar body biogenesis and trafficking in mouse alveolar epithelial cells.", "Abstract": "The pulmonary surfactant that lines the air-liquid surface within alveoli is a protein-lipid mixture essential for gas exchange.

immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is a condition associated with recurrent infections and non-infectious outcomes, including lung disease like bronchiectasis and granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung diseases (GLILD), autoimmune disease, enteropathy, and lymphoma. Treatment involves initiation of replacement immunoglobulin (Ig), which is a lifelong commitment. Prior to Ig replacement, life expectancy for patients with CVID was less than 15 years. With replacement Ig, it has improved to over 50 years. In most cases, patients present to a clinician with a history of recurrent infections, and treatment is indicated. However, in patients with asymptomatic disease, the best timing to start treatment can be difficult to determine. Case: We present a case of an otherwise healthy male who had an incidental diagnosis of CVID. Results: Workup revealed hypogammaglobulinemia for over 30 year. Discussion: Though successful in reducing infections, Ig replacement can come with many side effects, as well as a heavy medical burden to the patient and the healthcare system.

Estrogen is associated with an altered immune response of vaginal epithelial cells and prevention of certain vaginal infectious diseases.

Thus, here, VK2/E6E7 vaginal epithelial cells were infected with S. aureus, and the role of the estrogen receptor \u03b1-associated signaling pathway (ER\u03b1/FAK/Src/iNOS axis) in S. aureus adhesion was evaluated.

Low P stress can greatly hamper plant growth. Here, we identified a QTL (named QPH-9-1), which is associated with P efficiency across multiple environments through linkage analysis and genome-wide association study. Furthermore, we successfully cloned the underlying soybean (Glycine max) gene GmRR1 (a soybean type-B Response Regulator 1) that encodes a type-B response regulator protein. Knockout of GmRR1 resulted in a substantial increase in plant height, biomass, P uptake efficiency, and yield-related traits due to the modification of root structure. In contrast, overexpression of GmRR1 in plants resulted in a decrease in these phenotypes. Further analysis revealed that knockout of GmRR1 substantially increased the levels of auxin and ethylene in roots, thereby promoting root hair formation and growth by promoting the formation of root hair primordium and lengthening the root apical meristem. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated an interaction between GmRR1 and Histidine-containing Phosphotransmitter protein 1. Expression analysis suggested that these proteins coparticipated in response to low P stress. Analysis of genomic sequences showed that GmRR1 underwent a selection during soybean domestication.

A therapeutic approach to UC involves the repair of damaged intestinal barrier. Our study aimed to investigate whether aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediated the intestinal barrier repair effects of quercetin to ameliorate UC. 3% dextran sulfate sodium was used to induce colitic mice, and quercetin (25, 50, and 100\u2009mg/kg) was administered orally for 10\u2009days to assess the therapeutic effects. In vitro, Caco-2 cells were used to explore the effect of quercetin on tight junction protein expression and AhR activation. The results showed that quercetin alleviated colitic mice by restoring tight junctions (TJs) integrity via an AhR-dependent manner (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In vitro, quercetin dose-dependently elevated the expressions of TJs protein ZO-1 and Claudin1, and activated AhR by enhancing the expression of CYP1A1 and facilitating AhR nuclear translocation in Caco-2 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05). While AhR antagonist CH223191 reversed the therapeutic effects of quercetin (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and blocked quercetin-induced AhR activation and enhancement of TJs protein (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In conclusion, quercetin repaired intestinal barrier dysfunction by activating AhR-mediated enhancement of TJs to alleviate UC.

All 11 core targets in CA against OC were identified completely. The enrichment analysis of core targets revealed the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CA against OC in details, including metabolic recombination and immune microenvironment regulation. Additionally, pharmacological evaluation data in vitro suggested that CA inhibited human OC cell proliferation in the time- and dose-dependent manners.

The pharmacological activity of unsaturated fatty acid-rich vegetable oil interventions in the treatment of MAFLD has been demonstrated. This study evaluated the pharmacological activity of Polygala tenuifolia Willd, which contains high levels of 2-acetyl-1,3-diacyl-sn-glycerols (sn-2-acTAGs). Methods: In this study, a mouse model was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD, 31% lard oil diet), and the treatment group was fed a P. tenuifolia seed oil (PWSO) treatment diet (17% lard oil and 14% PWSO diet). The pharmacological activity and mechanism of PWSO were investigated by total cho-lesterol (TC) measurement, triglyceride (TG) measurement and histopathological observation, and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1), SREBP2 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways were evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. Results: PWSO attenuated the increases in plasma TC and TG levels. Furthermore, PWSO reduced the hepatic levels of TC and TG, ameliorating hepatic lipid accumulation. PWSO treatment effectively improves the level of hepatitic inflammation, such as reducing IL-6 levels and TNF-\u03b1 level. Discussion: PWSO treatment inactivated SREBP1 and SREBP2, which are involved in lipogenesis, to attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and mitigate the inflammatory response induced via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. This study demonstrated that PWSO can be used as a relatively potent dietary supplement to inhibit the occurrence and development of MAFLD.", "Keywords": ["NF-\u03baB signaling pathway", "Polygala tenuifolia Willd.", "SREBPs", "metabolic-associated fatty liver disease", "seed oil"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meiling", "Last Name": "Xin", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Hanlin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Bendong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Shufei", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxue", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianqi", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Novel Food Resources Processing, Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Processing Technology of Shandong Province, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Agro-Food Science and Technology, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuting", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengbao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenlong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinyue", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Novel Food Resources Processing, Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Processing Technology of Shandong Province, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Agro-Food Science and Technology, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37869350", "Title": "Evaluation of the relations between reproduction-related pituitary and ovarian hormones and abdominal fat area-related variables determined with computed tomography in overweight or obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "An understanding of the associations between midregion fat depots and systemic hormone levels will be crucial for developing health-promotion messages aimed at overweight or obese women.
