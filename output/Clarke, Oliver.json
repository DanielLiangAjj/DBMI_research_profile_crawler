HCN dysfunctions lead to sinoatrial block (HCN4), epilepsy (HCN1), and chronic pain (HCN2), widespread medical conditions awaiting subtype-specific treatments. Here, we address the problem by solving the cryo-EM structure of HCN4 in complex with ivabradine, to date the only HCN-specific drug on the market. Our data show ivabradine bound inside the open pore at 3 \u00c5 resolution. The structure unambiguously proves that Y507 and I511 on S6 are the molecular determinants of ivabradine binding to the inner cavity, while F510, pointing outside the pore, indirectly contributes to the block by controlling Y507. Cysteine 479, unique to the HCN selectivity filter (SF), accelerates the kinetics of block. Molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that ivabradine blocks the permeating ion inside the SF by electrostatic repulsion, a mechanism previously proposed for quaternary ammonium ions.", "Keywords": ["HCN", "ivabradine", "structure"], "MeSH terms": ["Ivabradine", "Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Humans", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Animals", "Potassium Channels", "Muscle Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Saponaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jan H", "Last Name": "Krumbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt 64289, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Chaves-Sanjuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Atiyeh Sadat", "Last Name": "Sharifzadeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Porro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Roberta", "Last Name": "Castelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Kay", "Last Name": "Hamacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt 64289, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martino", "Last Name": "Bolognesi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Dario", "Last Name": "DiFrancesco", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Thiel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Centre for Synthetic Biology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt 64287, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Moroni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan 20133, Italy."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2024Jul02"}, {"PMID": "38854058", "Title": "Revealing biomolecular structure and motion with neural ab initio cryo-EM reconstruction.", "Abstract": "Proteins and other biomolecules form dynamic macromolecular machines that are tightly orchestrated to move, bind, and perform chemistry.

With a two-step hybrid approach combining search and gradient-based optimization, DRGN-AI can reconstruct dynamic protein complexes from scratch without input poses or initial models. Using DRGN-AI, we reconstruct the compositional and conformational variability contained in a variety of benchmark datasets, process an unfiltered dataset of the DSL1/SNARE complex fully ab initio, and reveal a new \"supercomplex\" state of the human erythrocyte ankyrin-1 complex.

Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. Recruiting endogenous NEDD4-2 to diverse ion channel proteins (KCNQ1, ENaC, and CaV2.2) using a divalent (DiVa) nanobody format strongly reduced their functional expression with minimal off-target effects as assessed by global proteomics, compared to simple NEDD4-2 overexpression.

As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the \u03b2-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate. Here, we focused our attention on the study of SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins, and we found a general perturbation of the host cell calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and a selective rearrangement of the interorganelle contact sites. In vitro and in vivo biochemical analyses revealed that the binding of specific nanobodies to soluble regions of SARS-CoV-2 E protein reversed the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the E protein might be an important therapeutic candidate not only for vaccine development, but also for the clinical management of COVID designing drug regimens that, so far, are very limited.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "Pandemics", "Mitochondria", "Homeostasis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Poggio", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Vallese", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andreas J W", "Last Name": "Hartel", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Travis J", "Last Name": "Morgenstern", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Rauh", "Affiliation": "Membrane Biophysics, Department of Biology, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Flavia", "Last Name": "Giamogante", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Lucia", "Last Name": "Barazzuol", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth L", "Last Name": "Shepard", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver Biggs", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisa", "Last Name": "Brini", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Tito", "Last Name": "Cal\u00ec", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. tito.cali@unipd.it."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2023Apr29"}, {"PMID": "36574673", "Title": "Crystal structure of LGR ligand \u03b12/\u03b25 from Caenorhabditis elegans with implications for the evolution of glycoprotein hormones.", "Abstract": "A family of leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) mediate diverse physiological responses when complexed with their cognate ligands. LGRs are present in all metazoan animals. In humans, the LGR ligands include glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). These hormones are \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers of cystine-knot protein chains. LGRs and their ligand chains have coevolved. Ancestral hormone homologs, present in both bilaterian animals and chordates, are identified as \u03b12\u03b25. We have used single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and molecular replacement to determine structures of the \u03b12\u03b25 hormone from Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce\u03b12\u03b25). Ce\u03b12\u03b25 is unglycosylated, as are many other \u03b12\u03b25 hormones. Both Hs\u03b12\u03b25, the human homolog of Ce\u03b12\u03b25, and hTSH activate the same receptor (hTSHR). Despite having little sequence similarity to vertebrate GPHs, apart from the cysteine patterns from core disulfide bridges, Ce\u03b12\u03b25 is generally similar in structure to these counterparts; however, its \u03b12 and \u03b25 subunits are more symmetric as compared with \u03b1 and \u03b2 of hCG and hFSH. This quasisymmetry suggests a hypothetical homodimeric antecedent of the \u03b12\u03b25 and \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers. Known structures together with AlphaFold models from the sequences for other LGR ligands provide representatives for the molecular evolution of LGR ligands from early metazoans through the present-day GPHs. The experimental Ce\u03b12\u03b25 structure validates its AlphaFold model, and thus also that for Hs\u03b12\u03b25; and interfacial characteristics in a model for the Hs\u03b12\u03b25:hTSHR complex are similar to those found in an experimental hTSH:hTSHR structure.", "Keywords": ["cystine-knot hormone (CKH)", "evolution", "glycoprotein hormone (GPH)", "leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor (LGR)", "thyrostimulin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Glycoproteins", "Ligands", "Hormones", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kamel", "Last Name": "El Omari", "Affiliation": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus, Didcot OX11 0DE, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andrey A", "Last Name": "Lebedev", "Affiliation": "CCP4, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot OX11 0QX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jan03"}, {"PMID": "36362390", "Title": "Defective Thyroglobulin: Cell Biology of Disease.", "Abstract": "The primary functional units of the thyroid gland are follicles of various sizes comprised of a monolayer of epithelial cells (thyrocytes) surrounding an apical extracellular cavity known as the follicle lumen. In the normal thyroid gland, the follicle lumen is filled with secreted protein (referred to as colloid), comprised nearly exclusively of thyroglobulin with a half-life ranging from days to weeks. At the cellular boundary of the follicle lumen, secreted thyroglobulin becomes iodinated, resulting from the coordinated activities of enzymes localized to the thyrocyte apical plasma membrane. Thyroglobulin appearance in evolution is essentially synchronous with the appearance of the follicular architecture of the vertebrate thyroid gland. Thyroglobulin is the most highly expressed thyroid gene and represents the most abundantly expressed thyroid protein. Wildtype thyroglobulin protein is a large and complex glycoprotein that folds in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to homodimerization and export via the classical secretory pathway to the follicle lumen. However, of the hundreds of human thyroglobulin genetic variants, most exhibit increased susceptibility to misfolding with defective export from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering hypothyroidism as well as thyroidal endoplasmic reticulum stress. The human disease of hypothyroidism with defective thyroglobulin (either homozygous, or compound heterozygous) can be experimentally modeled in thyrocyte cell culture, or in whole animals, such as mice that are readily amenable to genetic manipulation. From a combination of approaches, it can be demonstrated that in the setting of thyroglobulin misfolding, thyrocytes under chronic continuous ER stress exhibit increased susceptibility to cell death, with interesting cell biological and pathophysiological consequences.", "Keywords": ["ER stress", "cell death", "endoplasmic reticulum", "hormonogenesis", "secretory pathway"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "Thyroglobulin", "Hypothyroidism", "Thyroid Epithelial Cells", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaohan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Crystal", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshiaki", "Last Name": "Morishita", "Affiliation": "Division of Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute 480-1195, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kookjoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Omer O", "Last Name": "Kabil", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruno", "Last Name": "Di Jeso", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Technologies, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Arvan", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2022Nov06"}, {"PMID": "36309343", "Title": "Comparison of consistency between image guided and craniometric transcranial magnetic stimulation coil placement.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Brain", "Brain Mapping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabella M", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Karol", "Last Name": "Osipowicz", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Alana", "Last Name": "Mackenzie", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Hugh", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Nicholas", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Cingulum Health, Rosebery, 2018, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jonas", "Last Name": "Holle", "Affiliation": "Cingulum Health, Rosebery, 2018, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Onur", "Last Name": "Tanglay", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stephane", "Last Name": "Doyen", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Sughrue", "Affiliation": "Omniscient Neurotechnology, Sydney, 2000, Australia; Cingulum Health, Rosebery, 2018, Australia.

HLA-DR3 confers the strongest susceptibility to APS3v. Previously we reported a unique amino acid signature pocket that predisposes to APS3v. We found that this pocket is flexible and can trigger APS3v by presenting both thyroid (Tg.1571, TPO.758) and islet (GAD.492) peptides to induce autoimmune response. We hypothesized that blocking the specific APS3v-HLA-DR3 pocket from presenting thyroid/islet antigens can block the autoimmune response in APS3v. To test this hypothesis we performed a virtual screen of small molecules blocking APS3v-HLA-DR3, and identified 11 small molecules hits that were predicted to block APS3v-HLA-DR3. Using the baculovirus-produced recombinant APS3v-HLA-DR3 protein we tested the 11 small molecules in an in vitro binding assay. We validated 4 small molecule hits, S9, S5, S53 and S15, that could block the APS3v-HLA-DR3 pocket in vitro. We then developed a novel humanized APS3v mouse model induced by co-immunizing a peptide mix of Tg.1571, TPO.758 and GAD.492. The immunized mice developed strong T-cell and antibody responses to the thyroid/islet peptides, as well as mouse thyroglobulin. In addition, the mice showed significantly lower free T4 levels compared to controls. Using the APS3v mouse model, we showed that one of the 4 small molecules, Cepharanthine (S53), blocked T-cell activation by thyroid/islet peptides ex vivo and in vivo.

Guided by high-resolution structures of skeletal muscle RyR1, obtained using cryogenic electron microscopy, we introduced mutations into putative Ca2+ and ATP binding sites and studied the function of the resulting mutant channels. These mutations confirmed the functional significance of the Ca2+ and ATP binding sites identified by structural studies based on the effects on channel regulation. Under normal conditions, Ca2+ activates RyR1 at low concentrations (\u00b5M) and inhibits it at high concentrations (mM). Mutations in the Ca2+-binding site impaired both activating and inhibitory regulation of the channel, suggesting a single site for both high and low affinity Ca2+-dependent regulation of RyR1 function. Mutation of residues that interact with the adenine ring of ATP abrogated ATP binding to the channel, whereas mutating residues that interact with the triphosphate tail only affected the degree of activation.

As higher concentrations of free Ca2+ were achieved, CSPs occurred for residues in the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) including those in EF1 and EF2 (CaKD\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0160\u00a0nM). Thermodynamic and kinetic Ca2+ binding studies showed that BP2 addition increased the Ca2+-binding affinity of CaM and slowed its Ca2+ dissociation rates (koff) in both the C- and N-lobe EF-hand domains, respectively. These data are consistent with BP2 binding to the C-lobe of CaM at low free Ca2+ concentrations (<100\u00a0nM) like those found at resting intracellular levels. As free Ca2+ levels approach 1000\u00a0nM, which is typical inside a cell upon an intracellular Ca2+-signaling event, BP2 is shown here to interact with both the N- and C-lobes of Ca2+-loaded CaM (CaCaM-BP2). Because this structural rearrangement observed for the CaCaM-BP2 complex occurs as intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations approach those typical of a Ca2+-signaling event (CaKD\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0160\u00a0nM), this conformational change could be relevant to vitamin A transport by full-length CaCaM-STRA6.", "Keywords": ["STRA6", "calmodulin", "retinol", "retinol-binding protein", "vitamin A receptor"], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium", "Calmodulin", "EF Hand Motifs", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Conformation", "Recombinant Proteins", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence", "Thermodynamics", "Vitamin A", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brianna D", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "The Center for Biomolecular Therapeutics (CBT), Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology University of Maryland School of Medicine, 108 N.

present within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and essential for normal growth during the blood-stage life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, displays structural similarity to many other cysteine proteases. However, PfSERA5 does not exhibit any detectable protease activity and therefore the role of the PfSERA5 papain-like domain (PfSERA5E), thought to remain bound to its cognate prodomain, remains unknown. In this study, we present a revised structure of the central PfSERA5E domain at a resolution of 1.2 \u00c5, and the first structure of the \"zymogen\" of this papain-like domain including its cognate prodomain (PfSERA5PE) to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. PfSERA5PE is somewhat structurally similar to that of other known proenzymes, retaining the conserved overall folding and orientation of the prodomain through, and occluding, the archetypal papain-like catalytic triad \"active-site\" cleft, in the same reverse direction as conventional prodomains. Our findings are congruent with previously identified structures of PfSERA5E and of similar \"zymogens\" and provide a foundation for further investigation into the function of PfSERA5.", "Keywords":

A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2-6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9-14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

It is based on the premise that K+ ions maintain a complete hydration shell while passing between the transmembrane cavity and cytosol, which must be accommodated. To put the canonical model to the test, we locked the conformation of a Kir K+ channel to prevent widening of the narrow collar. Unexpectedly, conduction was unimpaired in the locked channels. In parallel, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics to simulate K+ ions moving along the conduction pathway between the lower cavity and cytosol. During simulations, the constriction did not significantly widen. Instead, transient loss of some water molecules facilitated K+ permeation through the collar. The low free energy barrier to partial dehydration in the absence of conformational change indicates Kir channels are not gated by the canonical mechanism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cytosol", "Electric Conductivity", "Electric Impedance", "G Protein-Coupled Inwardly-Rectifying Potassium Channels", "Humans", "Ion Transport", "Ions", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Potassium", "Protein Conformation", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katrina A", "Last Name": "Black", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sitong", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Ruitao", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jani R", "Last Name": "Bolla", "Affiliation": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, 2300, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Monique", "Last Name": "Windley", "Affiliation": "Computational Cardiology Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Darlinghurst, NSW, 2010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Burns", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Adam P", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Computational Cardiology Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Darlinghurst, NSW, 2010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Derek", "Last Name": "Laver", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, 2300, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Carol V", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia. brian.smith@latrobe.edu.au."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline M", "Last Name": "Gulbis", "Affiliation": "Structural Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia. jgulbis@wehi.edu.au."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2020Jun15"}, {"PMID": "32389689", "Title": "Structural and Functional Characterization of Phosphatidylinositol-Phosphate Biosynthesis in Mycobacteria.", "Abstract": "In mycobacteria, phosphatidylinositol (PI) acts as a common lipid anchor for key components of the cell wall, including the glycolipids phosphatidylinositol mannoside, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan.

This provided the first high-resolution snapshot of this protein, showing a novel topology of a tightly assembled homodimer, and an unexpected physiological association with calmodulin in addition to insights into its potential mechanism of function. Specifically, a large hydrophobic cavity in the center of STRA6 linked to the known site of interaction with RBP suggested a route of retinol entry into the cell by diffusion into the membrane through a lateral opening of the cavity directly into the bilayer. Moreover, the capability to produce pure and homogeneous protein has allowed previously unattainable functional characterization of STRA6 in a reconstituted system. Here, we describe detailed methods for Danio rerio STRA6 expression in insect cells, purification in detergent and reconstitution in amphipol for structural characterization by cryo-EM.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TG locus were shown to be strongly associated with disease susceptibility in both humans and mice, and autoimmune response to TG is the earliest event in the development of thyroid autoimmunity in mice. The classical model of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) is induced by immunizing mice with TG protein together with an adjuvant to break down immune tolerance. The classical EAT model has limited utility in genetic studies of TG since it does not allow testing the effects of TG sequence variants on the development of autoimmune thyroiditis. In this study, we have immunized CBA-J mice, an EAT-susceptible strain, with an adenovirus vector encoding the full-length human TG (hTG) to generate a model of EAT in which the TG sequence can be manipulated to test AITD-associated TG SNPs. Methods: We immunized CBA-J mice with hTG-expressing adenovirus following the well-recognized experimental autoimmune Graves' disease protocol that also uses an adenovirus vector to deliver the immunogen. Results: After hTG adenovirus immunizations, mice developed higher T cell proliferative and cytokine responses to hTG and TG2098 (a major T cell epitope in AITD) and higher titers of TG and thyroperoxidase autoantibodies compared with mice immunized with control LacZ-expressing adenovirus. The mice, however, did not develop thyroidal lymphocytic infiltration and hypothyroidism.
