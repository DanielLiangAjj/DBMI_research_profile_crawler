[{"PMID": "36626229", "Title": "Low nephron endowment increases susceptibility to renal stress and chronic kidney disease.", "Abstract": "Preterm birth results in low nephron endowment and increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To understand the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD in preterm humans, we generated potentially novel mouse models with a 30%-70% reduction in nephron number by inhibiting or deleting Ret tyrosine kinase in the developing ureteric bud. These mice developed glomerular and tubular hypertrophy, followed by the transition to CKD, recapitulating the renal pathological changes seen in humans born preterm. We injected neonatal mice with gentamicin, a ubiquitous nephrotoxic exposure in preterm infants, and detected more severe proximal tubular injury in mice with low nephron number compared with controls with normal nephron number. Mice with low nephron number had reduced proliferative repair with more rapid development of CKD. Furthermore, mice had more profound inflammation with highly elevated levels of MCP-1 and CXCL10, produced in part by damaged proximal tubules. Our study directly links low nephron endowment with postnatal renal hypertrophy, which in this model is maladaptive and results in CKD. Underdeveloped kidneys are more susceptible to gentamicin-induced AKI, suggesting that AKI in the setting of low nephron number is more severe and further increases the risk of CKD in this vulnerable population.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Acute Kidney Injury", "Gentamicins", "Hypertrophy", "Infant, Premature", "Kidney", "Nephrons", "Premature Birth", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Holly A", "Last Name": "Hurst", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ileana", "Last Name": "Serrano Herrera", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette D", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Costantini", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2023Feb08"}, {"PMID": "35230973", "Title": "Snapshots of nascent RNA reveal cell- and stimulus-specific responses to acute kidney injury.", "Abstract": "The current strategy to detect acute injury of kidney tubular cells relies on changes in serum levels of creatinine. Yet serum creatinine (sCr) is a marker of both functional and pathological processes and does not adequately assay tubular injury. In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created mice expressing Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Uprt) and inoculated 4-thiouracil (4-TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven 4-TU-tagged RNA was isolated from intact kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs in collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Even lineage-related cell types expressed different genes in response to the 2 stressors. TU tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus, nascent RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, 4-TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Mice", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tian Huai", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Stauber", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Jacunski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neal", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miriam", "Last Name": "Callahan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Run", "Last Name": "Banlengchit", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Abraham D", "Last Name": "Levitman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Desanti De Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Madeleine S", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Edwin", "Last Name": "Mathieu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qingyin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Yuanji", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Tejashree", "Last Name": "Gopal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel", "Last Name": "Askanase", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Siddarth", "Last Name": "Arumugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob S", "Last Name": "Stevens", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Samuel K", "Last Name": "Sia", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2022Mar22"}, {"PMID": "30819339", "Title": "Evaluating Newborns at Risk for Early-Onset Sepsis.", "Abstract": "Early-onset sepsis (EOS) is an important cause of neonatal morbidity.
