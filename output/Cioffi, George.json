This region, which is about 12\u00a0degrees (3.5\u00a0mm) in diameter, is essential for everyday functions such as driving, reading, and face recognition. Here, we describe a model of progression of glaucomatous damage to this GCL donut. This model is based upon assumptions supported by the literature, and it predicts the patterns of glaucomatous damage to the GCL donut, as seen with optical coherence tomography (OCT). After describing the assumptions and predictions of this model, we test the model against data from our laboratory, as well as from the literature. Finally, three uses of the model are illustrated. One, it provides an aid to help clinicians focus on the essential central macula and to alert them to look for other, non-glaucomatous causes, when the GCL damage does not fit the pattern predicted by the model. Second, the patterns of progression predicted by the model suggest alternative end points for clinical trials.

Thirteen ophthalmology residents, fellows, and clinicians specializing in glaucoma participated in the study. Junior residents had less than 1\u2009year of experience, while senior residents had 2-3\u2009years of experience. The expert group consisted of fellows and faculty with over 3 to 30+ years of experience. Each participant was presented with a set of 20 Topcon OCT reports (10 healthy and 10 glaucomatous) and was asked to determine the presence or absence of glaucoma and rate their confidence of diagnosis. The eye movements of each participant were recorded as they diagnosed the reports using a Pupil Labs Core eye tracker. Expert ophthalmologists exhibited more refined and focused eye fixations, particularly on specific regions of the OCT reports, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) probability map and circumpapillary RNFL b-scan. The binary classification models developed using the derived features demonstrated high accuracy up to 94.0% in differentiating between expert and novice clinicians. The derived features and trained binary classification models hold promise for improving the accuracy of glaucoma detection and distinguishing between expert and novice ophthalmologists.

Methods: A 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Eligible individuals aged 40 years and older were recruited from affordable housing developments and senior centers in New York City. Participants underwent on-site eye health screening (best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure [IOP] measurements, and fundus photography). Fundus images were graded via telemedicine by a retina specialist. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the factors associated with abnormal retinal findings requiring referral to ophthalmology. Results: Participants with a retinal abnormality on fundus photography (n\u2009=\u2009157) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 68.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 years, female (63.7%), African American (50.3%), and Hispanic (43.3%). A total of 32 participants in our study passed the vision and IOP screening but had an abnormal retinal image and ocular pathology that would have been missed without fundus photography. Individuals who self-identified as having preexisting glaucoma (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20093.749, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.741-8.074, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) and had severe vision impairment (OR\u2009=\u20094.1034, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.0740-8.1186, p\u2009=\u20090.000) at the screening had significantly higher odds of having an abnormal retinal image. Conclusion: This community-based study targeted populations at-risk for eye disease, improved access to eye care, detected a significant number of retinal image abnormalities requiring follow-up by using telemedicine, and provided evidence of the importance of fundus photography during eye health screenings.

Fatigue and the end-of-day phenomenon can negatively impact task performance but have not been studied in the residency selection process. Our primary objective is to determine whether factors related to interview time and day as well as candidate's and interviewer's gender have a significant effect on residency interview scores. Methods \u2003Seven years of ophthalmology residency candidate evaluation scores from 2013 to 2019 were collected at a single academic institution, standardized by interviewer into relative percentiles (0-100 point grading scale), and grouped into the following categories for comparisons: different interview days (Day 1 vs. Day 2), morning versus afternoon (AM vs. PM), interview session (Day 1 AM/PM vs. Day 2 AM/PM), before and after breaks (morning break, lunch break, and afternoon break), residency candidate's gender, and interviewer's gender. Results \u2003Candidates in the morning sessions were found to have higher scores than afternoon sessions (52.75 vs. 49.28, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Interview scores in the early morning, late morning, and early afternoon were higher than late afternoon scores (54.47, 53.01, 52.15 vs. 46.74, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Across all interview years, there were no differences in scores received before and after morning breaks (51.71 vs. 52.83, p \u2009=\u20090.49), lunch breaks (53.01 vs. 52.15, p \u2009=\u20090.58), and afternoon breaks (50.35 vs. 48.30, p \u2009=\u20090.21). No differences were found in scores received by female versus male candidates (51.55 vs. 50.49, p \u2009=\u20090.21) or scores given by female versus male interviewers (51.31 vs. 50.84, p \u2009=\u20090.58). Conclusion \u2003Afternoon residency candidate interview scores, especially late afternoon, were significantly lower than morning scores, suggesting the need to further study the effects of interviewer's fatigue in the residency interview process. The interview day, presence of break times, candidate's gender, and interviewer's gender had no significant effects on interview score.", "Keywords": ["interview day", "interview score", "interview time", "interviewer's fatigue", "ophthalmology residency", "residency interview", "resident selection"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chih-Chiun J", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Moussa", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Royce W S", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lora R Dagi", "Last Name": "Glass", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "George A", "Last Name": "Cioffi", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bryan J", "Last Name": "Winn", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}], "Journal": "Journal of academic ophthalmology (2017)", "PubDate": "2022Jul"}, {"PMID": "37343189", "Title": "What is the Optimal Frequency of Visual Field Testing to Detect Rapid Progression Among Hypertensive Eyes?", "Abstract": "We evaluated 16,351 visual field (VF) tests from Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) database and showed that more frequent testing resulted in a shorter time to detect glaucoma progression, with the best trade-off being the 6-month intervals for high-risk and 12 months for low-risk patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Visual Fields", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Intraocular Pressure", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Field Tests", "Glaucoma", "Ocular Hypertension", "Optic Disk", "Disease Progression", "Follow-Up Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bruna", "Last Name": "Melchior", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Edward S.

Using an iterative, consensus-building approach and employing pilot data, an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to aid in the detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy was sought to address this challenge. To maximize the chance of success, we utilized all available information from the OCT circle and cube scans, applied both quantitative and semiquantitative data analysis methods, and aimed to limit the use of perimetry to cases where it is absolutely necessary. The outcome of this approach was an OCT-based method for the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy that did not require the use of perimetry for initial diagnosis. A decision tree was devised for testing and implementation in clinical practice and research that can be used by reading centers, researchers, and clinicians.

Recent work suggests that the OCT probability (p-) maps, also known as deviation maps, can play a key role in an OCT-based method. However, artifacts seen on the p-maps of healthy control eyes can resemble patterns of damage due to glaucoma. We document in section 2 that these glaucoma-like artifacts are relatively common and are probably due to normal anatomical variations in healthy eyes. We also introduce a simple anatomical artifact model based upon known anatomical variations to help distinguish these artifacts from actual glaucomatous damage. In section 3, we apply this model to an OCT-based method for detecting glaucoma that starts with an examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) p-map. While this method requires a judgment by the clinician, sections 4 and 5 describe automated methods that do not. In section 4, the simple model helps explain the relatively poor performance of commonly employed summary statistics, including circumpapillary RNFL thickness. In section 5, the model helps account for the success of an AI deep learning model, which in turn validates our focus on the RNFL p-map.

The objective of our study was to test instruments, implement protocols, and collect preliminary data for a larger 5-year study, which aims to improve detection of eye diseases and follow-up eye care in vulnerable populations using community health workers (CHW) and patient navigators. In the study, trained CHWs conducted vision screening and patient navigators scheduled on-site eye exams and arranged appointments for those referred to ophthalmology to improve adherence to follow-up eye care.Materials and Methods: Eligible individuals age 40-and-older were\u00a0recruited from the Riverstone Senior Center in Upper Manhattan, New York City. Participants underwent on-site vision screening (visual acuity with correction, intraocular pressure measurements, and fundus photography). Individuals who failed the vision screening were scheduled with an on-site optometrist for an eye exam; those with ocular pathologies were referred to an ophthalmologist. Participants were also administered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-8 (NEI-VFQ-8) and Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test by community health workers.Results:Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a042) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 70.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8, female (61.9%), and Hispanic (78.6%). Most individuals (78.6%, n =\u00a033) failed vision screening. Of those who failed, 84.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a028) attended the on-site eye exam with the optometrist. Ocular diagnoses: refractive error 13/28 (46.4%), glaucoma/glaucoma suspect 9/28 (32.1%), cataract 7/28 (25.0%), retina abnormalities 6/28 (21.4%); 13 people required eyeglasses.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using CHWs and patient navigators for reducing barriers to vision screening and optometrist-based eye exams in vulnerable populations, ultimately improving early detection of eye disease and linking individuals to additional eye care appointments.

While the experimental research using animal models provides growing information about cellular and molecular processes, parallel analysis of the clinical presentation of glaucoma accelerates the translational progress towards improved understanding, treatment, and clinical testing of glaucoma. Optic nerve axon injury triggers early alterations of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapses with function deficits prior to manifest RGC loss in animal models of glaucoma. For testing the clinical relevance of experimental observations, this study analyzed the functional correlation of localized alterations in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where RGCs establish synaptic connections with retinal bipolar and amacrine cells. Participants of the study included a retrospective cohort of 36 eyes with glaucoma and a control group of 18 non-glaucomatous subjects followed for two-years. The IPL was analyzed on consecutively collected macular SD-OCT scans, and functional correlations with corresponding 10-2 visual field scores were tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. The GEE-estimated rate of decrease in IPL thickness (R = 0.36, P<0.001) and IPL density (R = 0.36, P<0.001), as opposed to unchanged or increased IPL thickness or density, was significantly associated with visual field worsening at corresponding analysis locations. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, this association was independent from the patients' age, the baseline visual field scores, or the baseline thickness or alterations of retinal nerve fiber or RGC layers (P>0.05). These findings support early localized IPL alterations in correlation with progressing visual field defects in glaucomatous eyes. Considering the experimental data, glaucoma-related increase in IPL thickness/density might reflect dendritic remodeling, mitochondrial redistribution, and glial responses for synapse maintenance, but decreased IPL thickness/density might correspond to dendrite atrophy. The bridging of experimental data with clinical findings encourages further research along the translational path.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amacrine Cells", "Blindness", "Female", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Macula Lutea", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Nerve", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rukiye", "Last Name": "Ayd\u0131n", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mine", "Last Name": "Bar\u0131\u015f", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ceren", "Last Name": "Durmaz-Engin", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lama A", "Last Name": "Al-Aswad", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dana M", "Last Name": "Blumberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "George A", "Last Name": "Cioffi", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tongalp H", "Last Name": "Tezel", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "G\u00fclg\u00fcn", "Last Name": "Tezel", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33492894", "Title": "Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations (NYC-SIGHT): Design and Methodology.", "Abstract": "The Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations is a 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized study to improve detection and management of glaucoma and other eye diseases in vulnerable populations living in affordable housing developments.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Vision Screening", "Vulnerable Populations"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa A", "Last Name": "Hark", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Yocheved S", "Last Name": "Kresch", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Carlos Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Auran", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Prakash", "Last Name": "Gorroochurn", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stella", "Last Name": "Stempel", "Affiliation": "Edward S.
