However, the effectiveness of endosomal escape for the nucleic acid cargos encapsulated in LNPs is still low, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes and side effects. Hence, improving endosomal escape is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of nucleic acid delivery using LNPs. Here, a mechanical oscillation (frequency: 65 Hz) is utilized to prompt the LNP-mediated endosomal escape. The results reveal this mechanical oscillation can induce the combination and fusion between LNPs with opposite surface charges, enhance endosomal escape of mRNA by 14%, and increase the transfection efficiency of mRNA up to 1.67 times in the current study. Additionally, cell viability remains high at 99.3% after treatment with oscillation, which is comparable to that of untreated cells. Furthermore, there is no obvious damage to other membranous organelles. Thus, this work presents a user-friendly and safe approach to enhancing endosomal escape of mRNA and boosting gene expression. As a result, our work can be potentially utilized in both research and clinical fields to facilitate LNP-based delivery by enabling more effective release of LNP-encapsulated cargos from endosomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiawen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aneri", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Mir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria R", "Last Name": "Hudock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meghan R", "Last Name": "Pinezich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Guenthart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jinho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun22"}, {"PMID": "38824644", "Title": "Macrophages enhance contractile force in iPSC-derived human engineered cardiac tissue.", "Abstract": "Resident cardiac macrophages are critical mediators of cardiac function. Despite their known importance to cardiac electrophysiology and tissue maintenance, there are currently no stem-cell-derived models of human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs) that include resident macrophages. In this study, we made an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hECT model with a resident population of macrophages (iM0) to better recapitulate the native myocardium and characterized their impact on tissue function. Macrophage retention within the hECTs was confirmed via immunofluorescence after 28\u00a0days of cultivation. The inclusion of iM0s significantly impacted hECT function, increasing contractile force production. A potential mechanism underlying these changes was revealed by the interrogation of calcium signaling, which demonstrated the modulation of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in\u00a0+iM0 hECTs.

Current heart-on-a-chip platforms still do not fully mimic the native cardiac environment due to the absence of relevant cell types, such as EPIs. Here, using the Biowire II platform, engineered cardiac tissues with an epicardial outer layer and inner myocardial structure are constructed, and an image analysis approach is developed to track the EPI cell migration in a beating myocardial environment. Functional properties of EPI cardiac tissues improve over two weeks in culture. In conditions mimicking ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), the EPI cardiac tissues experience less cell death and a lower impact on functional properties. EPI cell coverage is significantly reduced and more diffuse under normoxic conditions compared to the post-IRI conditions. Upon IRI, migration of EPI cells into the cardiac tissue interior is observed, with contributions to alpha smooth muscle actin positive cell population. Altogether, a novel heart-on-a-chip model is designed to\u00a0incorporate EPIs through a formation process that mimics cardiac development, and this work demonstrates that EPI cardiac tissues respond

Multimodal In Vitro Analysis of Cardiac Function Enables Machine Learning Classification of Diseases and Drugs.", "Abstract": "Goal: Contractile response and calcium handling are central to understanding cardiac function and physiology, yet existing methods of analysis to quantify these metrics are often time-consuming, prone to mistakes, or require specialized equipment/license. We developed BeatProfiler, a suite of cardiac analysis tools designed to quantify contractile function, calcium handling, and force generation for multiple in vitro cardiac models and apply downstream machine learning methods for deep phenotyping and classification. Methods: We first validate BeatProfiler's accuracy, robustness, and speed by benchmarking against existing tools with a fixed dataset. We further confirm its ability to robustly characterize disease and dose-dependent drug response. We then demonstrate that the data acquired by our automatic acquisition pipeline can be further harnessed for machine learning (ML) analysis to phenotype a disease model of restrictive cardiomyopathy and profile cardioactive drug functional response. To accurately classify between these biological signals, we apply feature-based ML and deep learning models (temporal convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory model or TCN-BiLSTM). Results: Benchmarking against existing tools revealed that BeatProfiler detected and analyzed contraction and calcium signals better than existing tools through improved sensitivity in low signal data, reduction in false positives, and analysis speed increase by 7 to 50-fold. Of signals accurately detected by published methods (PMs), BeatProfiler's extracted features showed high correlations to PMs, confirming that it is reliable and consistent with PMs. The features extracted by BeatProfiler classified restrictive cardiomyopathy cardiomyocytes from isogenic healthy controls with 98% accuracy and identified relax90 as a top distinguishing feature in congruence with previous findings. We also show that our TCN-BiLSTM model was able to classify drug-free control and 4 cardiac drugs with different mechanisms of action at 96% accuracy. We further apply Grad-CAM on our convolution-based models to identify signature regions of perturbations by these drugs in calcium signals. Conclusions: We anticipate that the capabilities of BeatProfiler will help advance in vitro studies in cardiac biology through rapid phenotyping, revealing mechanisms underlying cardiac health and disease, and enabling objective classification of cardiac disease and responses to drugs.", "Keywords": ["Calcium handling", "cardiac analysis", "contractile function", "drug response", "machine learning (ML)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Youngbin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Kunlun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberta I", "Last Name": "Lock", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor R", "Last Name": "Nash", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Fleischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan Z", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry M", "Last Name": "Fine", "Affiliation": "Department of MedicineDivision of CardiologyColumbia University Medical Center New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}], "Journal": "IEEE open journal of engineering in medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38559188", "Title": "An engineered human cardiac tissue model reveals contributions of systemic lupus erythematosus autoantibodies to myocardial injury.", "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogenous autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, including the heart. The mechanisms by which myocardial injury develops in SLE, however, remain poorly understood. Here we engineered human cardiac tissues and cultured them with IgG fractions containing autoantibodies from SLE patients with and without myocardial involvement. We observed unique binding patterns of IgG from two patient subgroups: (i) patients with severe myocardial inflammation exhibited enhanced binding to apoptotic cells within cardiac tissues subjected to stress, and (ii) patients with systolic dysfunction exhibited enhanced binding to the surfaces of viable cardiomyocytes. Functional assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that IgGs from patients with systolic dysfunction exerted direct effects on engineered tissues in the absence of immune cells, altering tissue cellular composition, respiration and calcium handling. Autoantibody target characterization by phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) confirmed distinctive IgG profiles between patient subgroups. By coupling IgG profiling with cell surface protein analyses, we identified four pathogenic autoantibody candidates that may directly alter the function of cells within the myocardium.

To bridge this gap, we built a human vascular organoid model replicating Proteus syndrome's vasculature. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gene overexpression, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embodying the Proteus syndrome-specific AKTE17K point mutation for organoid generation. Our findings revealed that AKT overactivation in these organoids resulted in smaller sizes yet increased vascular connectivity, although with less stable connections. This could be due to the significant vasculogenesis induced by AKT overactivation. This phenomenon likely stems from boosted vasculogenesis triggered by AKT overactivation, leading to increased vascular sprouting. Additionally, a notable increase in dysfunctional PDGFR\u03b2+ mural cells, impaired in matrix secretion, was observed in these AKT-overactivated organoids. The application of AKT inhibitors (ARQ092, AZD5363, or GDC0068) reversed the vascular malformations; the inhibitors' effectiveness was directly linked to reduced connectivity in the organoids. In summary, our study introduces an innovative in vitro model combining organoid technology and gene editing to explore vascular pathophysiology in Proteus syndrome. This model not only simulates Proteus syndrome vasculature but also holds potential for mimicking vasculatures of other genetically driven diseases.

In biocompatibility testing, the lung-mimetic sealant shows minimal cytotoxicity and immunogenicity in vitro. Human primary monocytes exposed to sealant matrikines in vitro upregulate key genes (MARCO, PDGFB, VEGF) known to correlate with pleural wound healing and tissue repair in vivo.

Clinical management of air leaks is challenging due to limited methods to precisely locate and assess leaks. Here, we present a sound-guided methodology that enables rapid quantitative assessment and precise localization of air leaks by analyzing the distinct sounds generated as the air escapes through defective lung tissue. Air leaks often present after lung surgery due to loss of tissue integrity at or near a staple line. Accordingly, we investigated air leak sounds from a focal pleural defect in a rat model and from a staple line failure in a clinically relevant swine model to demonstrate the high sensitivity and translational potential of this approach. In rat and swine models of free-flowing air leak under positive pressure ventilation with intrapleural microphone 1\u00a0cm from the lung surface, we identified that: (a) pulmonary air leaks generate sounds that contain distinct harmonic series, (b) acoustic characteristics of air leak sounds can be used to classify leak severity, and (c) precise location of the air leak can be determined with high resolution (within 1\u00a0cm) by mapping the sound loudness level across the lung surface.

The Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) is focused on identifying and supporting unique approaches to reduce risks to human health and performance on future missions beyond low Earth orbit. This paper will describe three funded and complementary avenues for reducing the risk to humans from radiation exposure experienced in deep space. The first focus is on identifying new therapeutic targets to reduce the damaging effects of radiation by focusing on high throughput genetic screens in accessible, sometimes called lower, organism models. The second focus is to design innovative approaches for countermeasure development with special attention to nucleotide-based methodologies that may constitute a more agile way to design therapeutics. The final focus is to develop new and innovative ways to test radiation countermeasures in a human model system. While animal studies continue to be beneficial in the study of space radiation, they can have imperfect translation to humans. The use of three-dimensional (3D) complex in vitro models is a promising approach to aid the development of new countermeasures and personalized assessments of radiation risks. These three distinct and unique approaches complement traditional space radiation efforts and should provide future space explorers with more options to safeguard their short and long-term health.", "Keywords": ["3D tissue", "Extremophile", "Nucleotide-based approaches", "Organoid", "Radiation countermeasure", "Space radiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Cosmic Radiation", "Radiation Protection", "Space Flight", "Moon", "Radiation Exposure"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rihana S", "Last Name": "Bokhari", "Affiliation": "Agile Decision Sciences, NRESS, Arlington, VA 22202, United States of America.

We evaluated the effects of each pathway on the properties of engineered bone grafts and their capacity to drive bone regeneration. Bone-marrow-derived MSCs were differentiated on silk scaffolds into either hypertrophic chondrocytes (hyper) or osteoblasts (osteo) over 5 weeks of in vitro cultivation, and were implanted subcutaneously for 12 weeks. The pathways' constructs were evaluated over time with respect to gene expression, composition, histomorphology, microstructure, vascularization and biomechanics. Hypertrophic chondrocytes expressed higher levels of osteogenic genes and deposited significantly more bone mineral and proteins than the osteoblasts. Before implantation, the mineral in the hyper group was less mature than that in the osteo group. Following 12 weeks of implantation, the hyper group had increased mineral density but a similar overall mineral composition compared with the osteo group. The hyper group also displayed significantly more blood vessel infiltration than the osteo group. Both groups contained M2 macrophages, indicating bone regeneration.

Here, we report an imaging-guided bioreactor that allows in situ monitoring of the lumen of ex vivo airway tissues during controlled in vitro tissue manipulation and cultivation of isolated rat trachea. Using this platform, we demonstrated partial removal of the rat tracheal epithelium (i.e., de-epithelialization) without disrupting the underlying subepithelial cells and extracellular matrix. Through different tissue evaluation assays, such as immunofluorescent staining, DNA/protein quantification, and electron beam microscopy, we showed that the epithelium of the tracheal lumen can be effectively removed with negligible disruption in the underlying tissue layers, such as cartilage and blood vessel.

Essential to tissue homeostasis, disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic responses are the stratified organization of cartilage and cross talk at the osteochondral junction. Animal models may capture some of these features, but to establish clinically consistent therapeutics, there remains a need for high-fidelity models of OA that meet all the above requirements in a human patient-specific manner. In vitro bioengineered cartilage-bone tissue models could be developed to recapitulate physiological interactions with human cells and disease-initiating factors. In this study, we highlight human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as the advantageous cell source for these models and review approaches for chondrogenic fate specification from hiPSCs. To achieve native-like stratified cartilage organization with cartilage-bone interactions, spatiotemporal cues mimicking development can be delivered to engineered tissues by patterning of the cells, scaffold, and environment. Once healthy and native-like cartilage-bone tissues are established, an OA-like state can be induced through cytokine challenge or injurious loading. Bioengineered cartilage-bone tissues fall short of recapitulating the full complexity of native tissues, but have demonstrated utility in elucidating some mechanisms of OA progression and enabled screening of candidate therapeutics in patient-specific models.

Alterations in the stiffness of tissues can induce pathological interactions that affect cellular activity and tissue function. Underlying connections between tissue stiffness and disease highlights the importance of accurate quantitative characterizations of soft tissue mechanics, which can improve our understanding of disease and inform therapeutic development. In particular, accurate measurement of lung mechanical properties has been especially challenging due to the anatomical and mechanobiological complexities of the lung. Discrepancies between measured mechanical properties of dissected lung tissue samples and intact lung tissues in vivo has limited the ability to accurately characterize integral lung mechanics. Here, we report a non-destructive vacuum-assisted method to evaluate mechanical properties of soft biomaterials, including intact tissues and hydrogels. Using this approach, we measured elastic moduli of rat lung tissue that varied depending on stress-strain distribution throughout the lung. We also observed that the elastic moduli of enzymatically disrupted lung parenchyma increased by at least 64%. The reported methodology enables assessment of the nonlinear viscoelastic characteristics of intact lungs under normal and abnormal (i.e., injured, diseased) conditions and allows measurement of mechanical properties of tissue-mimetic biomaterials for use in therapeutics or in vitro models. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Accurate quantification of tissue stiffness is critical for understanding mechanisms of disease and developing effective therapeutics. Current modalities to measure tissue stiffness are destructive and preclude accurate assessment of lung mechanical properties, as lung mechanics are determined by complex features of the intact lung. To address the need for alternative methods to assess lung mechanics, we report a non-destructive vacuum-based approach to quantify tissue stiffness. We applied this method to correlate lung tissue mechanics with tissue disruption, and to assess the stiffness of biomaterials. This method can be used to inform the development of tissue-mimetic materials for use in therapeutics and disease models, and could potentially be applied for in-situ evaluation of tissue stiffness as a diagnostic or prognostic tool.", "Keywords": ["Elastic modulus", "Lung injury", "Lung mechanics", "Soft biomaterials", "Tissue stiffness"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Elastic Modulus", "Hydrogels", "Lung", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiawen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Mir", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meghan R", "Last Name": "Pinezich", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brandon A", "Last Name": "Guenthart", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sarah X L", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jinho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States.

In parallel, machine learning methods are being applied to biomedical science in unprecedented ways. Machine learning has been used to distinguish healthy from diseased cardiomyocytes using calcium (Ca2+) transient signals. Most Ca2+ transient signals are obtained via terminal assays that do not permit longitudinal studies, although some recently developed options can circumvent these concerns. Here, we describe the use of machine learning to identify healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes according to their contractility profiles, which are derived from brightfield videos. This noncontact, label-free approach allows for the continued cultivation of cells after they have been evaluated for use in other assays and can be readily extended to organs-on-chip. To demonstrate utility, we assessed contractility profiles of cardiomyocytes obtained from patients with Timothy Syndrome (TS), a long QT disease which can lead to fatal arrhythmias, and from healthy individuals. The videos were processed and classified using machine learning methods and their performance was evaluated according to several parameters. The trained algorithms were able to distinguish the TS cardiomyocytes from healthy controls and classify two different healthy controls. The proposed computational machine learning evaluation of human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes' contractility profiles has the potential to identify other genetic proarrhythmic events, screen therapeutic agents for inducing or suppressing long QT events, and predict drug-target interactions.

The principal regulator of the fibrotic cascade is transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21), a factor that induces rapid proliferation and differentiation of resident fibroblasts. In this study, we demonstrate successful inhibition of TGF-\u03b21-driven myofibroblastic differentiation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes using a small molecule TGF-\u03b21 receptor inhibitor, SB-431542. We also demonstrate successful encapsulation of SB-431542 in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) as a potential prophylactic treatment for arthrofibrosis and characterize drug release and bioactivity in a three-dimensional collagen gel contraction assay. We assessed the effects of TGF-\u03b21 and SB-431542 on cell proliferation and viability in monolayer cultures. Opposing dose-dependent trends were observed in cell proliferation, which increased in TGF-\u03b21-treated cultures and decreased in SB-431542-treated cultures relative to control (p\u2009<\u20090.05). SB-431542 was not cytotoxic at the concentrations studied (0-50\u2009\u03bcM) and inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced collagen gel contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, TGF-\u03b21-treated gels contracted to 18%\u2009\u00b1\u20091% of their initial surface area, while gels treated with TGF-\u03b21 and \u226510\u2009\u03bcM SB-431542 showed no evidence of contraction (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Upon removal of the compound, all gels contracted to control levels after 44\u2009h in culture, necessitating sustained delivery for prolonged inhibition. To this end, SB-431542 was encapsulated in PLGA microspheres (SBMS) that had an average diameter of 87.5\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u2009\u03bcm and a loading capacity of 4.3\u2009\u03bcg SB-431542 per milligram of SBMS. Functional assessment of SBMS revealed sustained inhibition of TGF-\u03b21-induced gel contraction as well as hallmark features of myofibroblastic differentiation, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression and connective tissue growth factor production. These results suggest that SB-431542 may be used to counter TGF-\u03b21-driven events in the fibrotic cascade in the knee cartilage. Impact statement Arthrofibrosis is the most prevalent comorbidity resulting from orthopedic procedures such as total knee arthroplasty that is characterized by excess deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Despite its prevalence, treatments are generally palliative, and there is no effective prophylactic therapy. We report that the small molecule transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21) receptor inhibitor, SB-431542, can inhibit the TGF-\u03b21-driven myofibroblastic differentiation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes.

Studies have sought to improve craniofacial bone grafts without addressing the cartilage, which is essential to TMJ function. For the human-sized TMJ in the Yucatan minipig model, we engineered autologous, biologically, and anatomically matched cartilage-bone grafts for repairing the ramus-condyle unit (RCU), a geometrically intricate structure subjected to complex loading forces. Using image-guided micromilling, anatomically precise scaffolds were created from decellularized bone matrix and infused with autologous adipose-derived chondrogenic and osteogenic progenitor cells. The resulting constructs were cultured in a dual perfusion bioreactor for 5 weeks before implantation. Six months after implantation, the bioengineered RCUs maintained their predefined anatomical structure and regenerated full-thickness, stratified, and mechanically robust cartilage over the underlying bone, to a greater extent than either autologous bone-only engineered grafts or acellular scaffolds. Tracking of implanted cells and parallel bioreactor studies enabled additional insights into the progression of cartilage and bone regeneration.

In this review, we summarize recent advances in cardiac tissue-on-a-chip (CTC) platforms and discuss how they are uniquely situated to advance our understanding of EVs in cardiac disease and regeneration.", "Keywords": ["cardiac tissue-on-a-chip", "disease modeling", "extracellular vesicles", "intercellular signaling", "regenerative cardiac therapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Extracellular Vesicles", "Heart", "Humans", "Lab-On-A-Chip Devices", "Myocardium", "Regeneration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karl T", "Last Name": "Wagner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Trevor R", "Last Name": "Nash", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bohao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Linsitinib, a novel anti-cancer drug, showed promising results in pre-clinical models of Ewing Sarcoma (ES), where it suppressed tumor growth. However, a Phase II clinical trial in several European centers with patients showed relapsed and/or refractory ES. We report an integrated, open setting, imaging and sampling accessible, polysulfone-based platform, featuring minimal hydrophobic compound binding. Two bioengineered human tissues - bone ES tumor and heart muscle - were cultured either in isolation or in the integrated platform and subjected to a clinically used linsitinib dosage. The measured anti-tumor efficacy and cardiotoxicity were compared with the results observed in the clinical trial. Only the engineered tumor tissues, and not monolayers, recapitulated the bone microenvironment pathways targeted by linsitinib, and the clinically-relevant differences in drug responses between non-metastatic and metastatic ES tumors. The responses of non-metastatic ES tumor tissues and heart muscle to linsitinib were much closer to those observed in the clinical trial for tissues cultured in an integrated setting than for tissues cultured in isolation. Drug treatment of isolated tissues resulted in significant decreases in tumor viability and cardiac function. Meanwhile, drug treatment in an integrated setting showed poor tumor response and less cardiotoxicity, which matched the results of the clinical trial. Overall, the integration of engineered human tumor and cardiac tissues in the integrated platform improved the predictive accuracy for both the direct and off-target effects of linsitinib.

PEMF coils oriented parallel to the articular surface induced superior repair stiffness compared to both perpendicular PEMF (p\u2009=\u2009.026) and control (p\u2009=\u2009.012).

However, the immature phenotype of hiPS-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) limits their utility. We have developed a protocol to generate engineered cardiac tissues from hiPS cells and electromechanically mature them toward an adult-like phenotype. This protocol also provides optimized methods for analyzing these tissues' functionality, ultrastructure, and cellular properties. The approach relies on biological adaptation of cultured tissues subjected to biomimetic cues, applied at an increasing intensity, to drive accelerated maturation. hiPS cells are differentiated into cardiomyocytes and used immediately after the first contractions are observed, when they still have developmental plasticity. This starting cell population is combined with human dermal fibroblasts, encapsulated in a fibrin hydrogel and allowed to compact under passive tension in a custom-designed bioreactor. After 7 d of tissue formation, the engineered tissues are matured for an additional 21 d by increasingly intense electromechanical stimulation. Tissue properties can be evaluated by measuring contractile function, responsiveness to electrical stimuli, ultrastructure properties (sarcomere length, mitochondrial density, networks of transverse tubules), force-frequency and force-length relationships, calcium handling, and responses to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists. Cell properties can be evaluated by monitoring gene/protein expression, oxidative metabolism, and electrophysiology. The protocol takes 4 weeks and requires experience in advanced cell culture and machining methods for bioreactor fabrication. We anticipate that this protocol will improve modeling of cardiac diseases and testing of drugs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Heart", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kacey", "Last Name": "Ronaldson-Bouchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Yeager", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diogo", "Last Name": "Teles", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "LouJin", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Departments of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, and of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kumi", "Last Name": "Morikawa", "Affiliation": "Departments of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, and of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Holly M", "Last Name": "Wobma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Vasciaveo", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward C", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masayuki", "Last Name": "Yazawa", "Affiliation": "Departments of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, and of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. gv2131@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature protocols", "PubDate": "2019Oct"}, {"PMID": "31363231", "Title": "Author Correction: Advanced maturation of human cardiac tissue grown from pluripotent stem cells.", "Abstract": "An Amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kacey", "Last Name": "Ronaldson-Bouchard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Yeager", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "LouJin", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dario", "Last Name": "Sirabella", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kumi", "Last Name": "Morikawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diogo", "Last Name": "Teles", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masayuki", "Last Name": "Yazawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. gv2131@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31064987", "Title": "Regeneration of severely damaged lungs using an interventional cross-circulation platform.", "Abstract": "The number of available donor organs limits lung transplantation, the only lifesaving therapy for the increasing population of patients with end-stage lung disease.

Currently, there is no clinically relevant therapy available to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). While many drugs have shown promise in reducing IRI in preclinical studies, none of these drugs have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials. Part of this failure to translate therapies can be attributed to the reliance on small animal models for preclinical studies. While animal models encapsulate the complexity of the systemic in vivo environment, they do not fully recapitulate human cardiac physiology. Furthermore, it is difficult to uncouple the various interacting pathways in vivo. In contrast, in vitro models using isolated cardiomyocytes allow studies of the direct effect of therapeutics on cardiomyocytes. External factors can be controlled in simulated ischemia-reperfusion to allow for better understanding of the mechanisms that drive IRI. In addition, the availability of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPS-CMs) offers the opportunity to recapitulate human physiology in vitro. Unfortunately, hIPS-CMs are relatively fetal in phenotype, and are more resistant to hypoxia than the mature cells. Tissue engineering platforms can promote cardiomyocyte maturation for a more predictive physiologic response. These platforms can further be improved upon to account for the heterogenous patient populations seen in the clinical settings and facilitate the translation of therapies. Thereby, the current preclinical studies can be further developed using currently available tools to achieve better predictive drug testing and understanding of IRI.

We propose that priming MSCs prior to administration will improve their therapeutic efficacy. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) priming are cues common to situations of immune escape that have individually shown promise as MSC priming cues but have not been systematically compared. Using mixed lymphocyte reactions, we show that priming MSCs with either cue alone improves T-cell inhibition. However, combining the two cues results in additive effects and markedly enhances the immunosuppressive phenotype of MSCs. We demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces expression of numerous immunosuppressive proteins (IDO, PD-L1, HLA-E, HLA-G), whereas hypoxia switches MSCs to glycolysis, causing rapid glucose consumption and production of T-cell inhibitory lactate levels. Dual IFN-\u03b3/hypoxia primed MSCs display both attributes and have even higher induction of immunosuppressive proteins over IFN-\u03b3 priming alone (IDO and HLA-G), which may reflect another benefit of metabolic reconfiguration.", "Keywords": ["Mesenchymal stromal cells", "hypoxia", "immunosuppression", "interferon gamma", "metabolism", "priming"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Holly M", "Last Name": "Wobma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Kanai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Shih", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hao Wei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raimon", "Last Name": "Duran-Struuck", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shahar", "Last Name": "Goeta", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lewis M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology and regenerative medicine", "PubDate": "2018Mar"}, {"PMID": "30349048", "Title": "Live imaging of stem cells in the germarium of the Drosophila ovary using a reusable gas-permeable imaging chamber.", "Abstract": "Live imaging of stem cells and their support cells can be used to visualize cellular dynamics and fluctuations of intracellular signals, proteins, and organelles in order to better understand stem cell behavior in the niche.

Regardless of whether the cells are primed (exposed to instructive cues) before administration, their phenotype will respond to environmental signals present in the pathophysiological setting being treated. Since hypoxia and inflammation coexist in the settings of acute injury and chronic disease we sought to explore how the proteome and metabolome of MSCs changes when cells were exposed to 48\u202fh of 1% oxygen, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), or both cues together. We specifically focused on changes in cell metabolism, immune modulation, extracellular matrix secretion and modification, and survival capacity. IFN-\u03b3 promoted expression of anti-pathogenic proteins and induced MSCs to limit inflammation and fibrosis while promoting their own survival.

New in vitro testing systems are needed to evaluate efficacies of new anti-inflammatory biological drugs, ideally in a patient-specific manner. To address this need, we studied microspheroids containing 10,000 human osteoarthritic primary chondrocytes (OACs) or chondrogenically differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), obtained from three donors. Hypothesizing that this system can recapitulate clinically observed effects of anti-inflammatory drugs, spheroids were exposed to TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or to supernatant containing secretome from activated macrophages (MCM). The anti-inflammatory efficacies of anti-TNF-\u03b1 biologicals adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, and the anti-IL-1\u03b2 agent anakinra were assessed in short-term microspheroid and long-term macrospheroid cultures (100,000 OACs). While gene and protein expressions were evaluated in microspheroids, diameters, amounts of DNA, glycosaminoglycans, and hydroxiproline were measured in macrospheroids. The tested drugs significantly decreased the inflammation induced by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. The differences in potency of anti-TNF-\u03b1 biologicals at 24 h and 3 weeks after their addition to inflamed spheroids were comparable, showing high predictability of short-term cultures. Moreover, the data obtained with microspheroids grown from OACs and chondrogenically differentiated MSCs were comparable, suggesting that MSCs could be used for this type of in vitro testing. We propose that in vitro gene expression measured after the first 24 h in cultures of chondrogenically differentiated MSCs can be used to determine the functionality of anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs in personalized and preclinical studies. \u00a9 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

We studied the effects of perfusion on hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, matrix production, and subsequent bone formation. Hypertrophic constructs were created by differentiation in chondrogenic medium (2 weeks) and maturation in hypertrophic medium (3 weeks). Bioreactors were customized to study a range of flow rates (0-1200\u2009\u03bcm/s).

Following an 8-week implantation into the critical-size femoral defect in nude rats, nonperfused constructs displayed larger bone volume, more compact mineralized matrix, and better integration with the adjacent native bone. Therefore, although medium perfusion stimulated the formation of bone template in vitro, it failed to enhance bone regeneration in vivo.

However, large and complex fractures exceed bone's natural repair capacity and result in non-unions, requiring external intervention to facilitate regeneration. One potential treatment solution, tissue-engineered bone grafts, has been dominated by recapitulating intramembranous ossification (bone formation by osteoblasts), although most serious bone injuries heal by endochondral ossification (bone formation by remodeling of hypertrophic cartilaginous anlage). The field has demonstrated that using endochondral ossification-based strategies can lead to bone deposition. However, stem cell differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes, the key cell type in endochondral ossification, have not been studied for long bone defect repair. With translation in mind, we created tissue-engineered grafts using human adipose stem cells (ASC), a clinically relevant stem cell source, differentiated into hypertrophic chondrocytes in decellularized bone scaffolds, and implanted these grafts into critical-size femoral defects in athymic rats. Over 12 weeks of implantation, these grafts were compared to acellular scaffolds and grafts engineered using ASC-derived osteoblasts. Grafts engineered using hypertrophic chnodrocytes recapitulated endochondral ossification, as evidenced by the expression of genes and proteins associated with bone formation. Markedly enhanced bone deposition was associated with extensive bone remodeling and the formation of bone marrow, and with the presence of pro-regenerative M2 macrophages within the hypertrophic grafts. As a result, hypertrophic chondrocyte grafts bridged 7/8 defects, as compared to only 1/8 for osteoblast grafts and 3/8 acellular scaffolds.

Our goals were (a) to study the viability of a tissue-engineered construct with cardiac adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells (cardiac ATDPCs) and (b) to examine the effect of electromechanically stimulated cardiac ATDPCs within a myocardial infarction (MI) model in mice for the first time. Cardiac ATDPCs were electromechanically stimulated at 2-millisecond pulses of 50 mV/cm at 1 Hz and 10% stretching during 7 days. The cells were harvested, labeled, embedded in a fibrin hydrogel, and implanted over the infarcted area of the murine heart. A total of 39 animals were randomly distributed and sacrificed at 21 days: groups of grafts without cells and with stimulated or nonstimulated cells. Echocardiography and gene and protein analyses were also carried out. Physiologically stimulated ATDPCs showed increased expression of cardiac transcription factors, structural genes, and calcium handling genes. At 21 days after implantation, cardiac function (measured as left ventricle ejection fraction between presacrifice and post-MI) increased up to 12% in stimulated grafts relative to nontreated animals. Vascularization and integration with the host blood supply of grafts with stimulated cells resulted in increased vessel density in the infarct border region. Trained cells within the implanted fibrin patch expressed main cardiac markers and migrated into the underlying ischemic myocardium.

We hypothesized that mechanically constraining the proteoglycan-induced tissue swelling would enhance construct functional properties through the development of a more stable collagen framework. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel \"cage\" growth system to mechanically prevent tissue constructs from swelling while ensuring adequate nutrient supply to the growing construct. The effectiveness of constrained culture was examined by testing constructs embedded within two different scaffolds: agarose and cartilage-derived matrix hydrogel (CDMH). Constructs were seeded with immature bovine chondrocytes and cultured under free swelling (FS) conditions for 14 days with transforming growth factor-\u03b2 before being placed into a constraining cage for the remainder of culture. Controls were cultured under FS conditions throughout. Agarose constructs cultured in cages did not expand after the day 14 caging while FS constructs expanded to 8\u2009\u00d7\u2009their day 0 weight after 112 days of culture.

We previously demonstrated that nutrient transport limitations can be mitigated by the introduction of channels in 10\u2009mm diameter cartilage constructs. In this study, we scaled up our previous system to cast and cultivate 40\u2009mm diameter constructs (2.3\u2009mm overall thickness); 4\u2009mm diameter and channeled 10\u2009mm diameter constructs were studied for comparison. Furthermore, to assess whether prior results using primary bovine cells are applicable for passaged cells-a more clinically realistic scenario-we cast constructs of each size with primary or twice-passaged cells. Constructs were assessed mechanically for equilibrium compressive Young's modulus (EY), dynamic modulus at 0.01\u2009Hz (G*), and friction coefficient (\u03bc); they were also assessed biochemically, histologically, and immunohistochemically for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen contents. By maintaining open channels, we successfully cultured robust constructs the size of entire human articular cartilage layers (growing to \u223c52\u2009mm in diameter, 4\u2009mm thick, mass of 8\u2009g by day 56), representing a 100-fold increase in scale over our 4\u2009mm diameter constructs, without compromising their functional properties. Large constructs reached EY of up to 623\u2009kPa and GAG contents up to 8.9%/ww (% of wet weight), both within native cartilage ranges, had G* >2\u2009MPa, and up to 3.5%/ww collagen. Constructs also exhibited some of the lowest \u03bc reported for engineered cartilage (0.06-0.11). Passaged cells produced tissue of lower quality, but still exhibited native EY and GAG content, similar to their smaller controls. The constructs produced in this study are, to our knowledge, the largest engineered cartilage constructs to date which possess native EY and GAG, and are a testament to the effectiveness of nutrient channels in overcoming transport limitations in cartilage tissue engineering.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cartilage", "Cattle", "Chondrocytes", "Elastic Modulus", "Materials Testing", "Surface Properties", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander D", "Last Name": "Cigan", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Krista M", "Last Name": "Durney", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Nims", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Clark T", "Last Name": "Hung", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gerard A", "Last Name": "Ateshian", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Tissue engineering.

Here, we report a three-dimensional tumor model for studying exosomes, using Ewing's sarcoma type 1 as a clinically relevant example. The bioengineered model was designed based on the hypothesis that the 3-dimensionality, composition and stiffness of the tumor matrix are the critical determinants of the size and cargo of exosomes released by the cancer cells. We analyzed the effects of the tumor microenvironment on exosomes, and the effects of exosomes on the non-cancer cells from the bone niche. Exosomes from the tissue-engineered tumor had similar size distribution as those in the patients' plasma, and were markedly smaller than those in monolayer cultures. Bioengineered tumors and the patients' plasma contained high levels of the Polycomb histone methyltransferase EZH2 mRNA relatively to their monolayer counterparts.

Increasingly close-packed channels have helped overcome nutrient transport limitations in centimeter-sized chondrocyte-agarose constructs, yet optimal channel spacings to recapitulate native cartilage compositional and mechanical properties in constructs this large have not been identified. Transient active TGF-\u03b2 treatment consistently reproduces native compressive Young\u05f3s modulus (EY) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in constructs, but standard dosages of 10ng/mL exacerbate matrix heterogeneity. To ultimately produce articular layer-sized constructs, we must first optimize channel spacing and investigate the role of TGF-\u03b2 in the utility of channels. We cultured \u220510mm constructs with 0, 12, 19, or 27 nutrient channels (\u22051mm) for 6-8 weeks with 0, 1, or 10ng/mL TGF-\u03b2; subsequently we analyzed them mechanically, biochemically, and histologically.

Delayed or non-healing of bone is a major clinical problem, with around 10% of fracture patients suffering from unsatisfying healing outcomes. Inflammation is traditionally seen as a defense mechanism, but was recently found essential in supporting and modulating regenerative cascades. In bone healing, macrophages and T- and B-cells interact with progenitor cells, bone forming osteoblasts and remodeling osteoclasts. Among the cells of the innate immunity, macrophages are promising candidates for targets in immune-modulatory interventions that would overcome complications in bone healing and bone-related diseases. Among the cells of the adaptive immune system, CD8+ T cells have been shown to have a negative impact on bone fracture healing outcome, whereas regulatory T cells could be promising candidates that have a positive, modulating effect on bone fracture healing.

It is typically exogenously supplemented in the culture medium in its active form, with the expectation that it will readily transport into tissue constructs through passive diffusion and influence cellular biosynthesis uniformly. The results of this investigation advance three novel concepts regarding the role of TGF-\u03b2 in cartilage tissue engineering that have important implications for tissue development. First, through the experimental and computational analysis of TGF-\u03b2 concentration distributions, we demonstrate that, contrary to conventional expectations, media-supplemented exogenous active TGF-\u03b2 exhibits a pronounced concentration gradient in tissue constructs, resulting from a combination of high-affinity binding interactions and a high cellular internalization rate. These gradients are sustained throughout the entire culture duration, leading to highly heterogeneous tissue growth; biochemical and histological measurements support that while biochemical content is enhanced up to 4-fold at the construct periphery, enhancements are entirely absent beyond 1\u00a0mm from the construct surface. Second, construct-encapsulated chondrocytes continuously secrete large amounts of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 in its latent form, a portion of which undergoes cell-mediated activation and enhances biosynthesis uniformly throughout the tissue. Finally, motivated by these prior insights, we demonstrate that the alternative supplementation of additional exogenous latent TGF-\u03b2 enhances biosynthesis uniformly throughout tissue constructs, leading to enhanced but homogeneous tissue growth. This novel demonstration suggests that latent TGF-\u03b2 supplementation may be utilized as an important tool for the translational engineering of large cartilage constructs that will be required to repair the large osteoarthritic defects observed clinically.", "Keywords": ["Biochemical gradients", "Cartilage tissue engineering", "Finite element model", "Growth factor delivery", "Heterogeneous growth", "Transforming growth factor beta"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autocrine Communication", "Cartilage", "Cattle", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cells, Cultured", "Chondrocytes", "Computer Simulation", "Culture Media", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Models, Biological", "Organoids", "Osmolar Concentration", "Recombinant Proteins", "Tissue Engineering", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Transforming Growth Factor beta3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Albro", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Nims", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Krista M", "Last Name": "Durney", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Alexander D", "Last Name": "Cigan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Jay J", "Last Name": "Shim", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Clark T", "Last Name": "Hung", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Gerard A", "Last Name": "Ateshian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}], "Journal": "Biomaterials", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "26500109", "Title": "Differential gene expression in human, murine, and cell line-derived macrophages upon polarization.", "Abstract": "The mechanisms by which macrophages control the inflammatory response, wound healing, biomaterial-interactions, and tissue regeneration appear to be related to their activation/differentiation states. Studies of macrophage behavior in vitro can be useful for elucidating their mechanisms of action, but it is not clear to what extent the source of macrophages affects their apparent behavior, potentially affecting interpretation of results. Although comparative studies of macrophage behavior with respect to cell source have been conducted, there has been no direct comparison of the three most commonly used cell sources: murine bone marrow, human monocytes from peripheral blood (PB), and the human leukemic monocytic cell line THP-1, across multiple macrophage phenotypes. In this study, we used multivariate discriminant analysis to compare the in vitro expression of genes commonly chosen to assess macrophage phenotype across all three sources of macrophages, as well as those derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), that were polarized towards four distinct phenotypes using the same differentiation protocols: M(LPS,IFN) (aka M1), M(IL4,IL13) (aka M2a), M(IL10) (aka M2c), and M(-) (aka M0) used as control. Several differences in gene expression trends were found among the sources of macrophages, especially between murine bone marrow-derived and human blood-derived M(LPS,IFN) and M(IL4,IL13) macrophages with respect to commonly used phenotype markers like CCR7 and genes associated with angiogenesis and tissue regeneration like FGF2 and MMP9. We found that the genes with the most similar patterns of expression among all sources were CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 for M(LPS,IFN) and CCL17 and CCL22 for M(IL4,IL13). Human PB-derived macrophages and human iPSC-derived macrophages showed similar gene expression patterns among the groups and genes studied here, suggesting that iPSC-derived monocytes have the potential to be used as a reliable cell source of human macrophages for in vitro studies.

As the plugs travel, a thin aqueous film is generated between the plugs as a result of the leading plug's aqueous deposition onto the inner surface of the tube. The leading plug continuously loses volume by film deposition onto the surface and eventually ruptures.

Methods to locally control the polarization of macrophages is of great interest for biomedical implants and tissue engineering. To that end, silk protein was used to form biopolymer films that release either IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 to control the polarization of macrophages. Modulation of the solubility of the silk films through regulation of \u03b2-sheet (crystalline) content enabled a short-term release (4-8 h) of either cytokine, with smaller amounts released out to 24 h. Altering the solubility of the films was accomplished by varying the time that the films were exposed to water vapor. The released IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 induced polarization of THP-1 derived macrophages into the M1 or M2 phenotypes, respectively. The silk biomaterials were able to release enough IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 to repolarize the macrophage from M1 to M2 and vice versa, demonstrating the well-established plasticity of macrophages. High \u03b2-sheet content films that are not soluble and do not release the trapped cytokines were also able to polarize macrophages that adhered to the surface through degradation of the silk protein. Chemically conjugating IFN-\u03b3 to silk films through disulfide bonds allowed for longer-term release to 10 days. The release of covalently attached IFN-\u03b3 from the films was also able to polarize M1 macrophages in vitro.

Here we describe a more controlled delivery of soluble reagents (e.g., drugs, enzymes, and radionuclides) in microvolume liquid plugs to targeted branches of the pulmonary airway tree: upper airways, small airways (bronchioles), or the most distal alveoli. In this approach, a soluble liquid plug of very small volume (<1 mL) is instilled into the upper airways, and with programmed air ventilation of the lungs, the plug is pushed into a specific desired (more distal) airway to achieve deposition of liquid film onto the lung epithelium. The plug volume and ventilation conditions were determined by mathematical modeling of plug transport in a tubular geometry, and targeted liquid film deposition was demonstrated in rat lungs by three different in vivo imaging modalities.

Chondrogenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been studied using supplemental and cell-secreted morphogenetic factors. The use of bioreactors enabled insights into the effects of physical forces and controlled oxygen tension. In this study, we investigated the interactive effects of controlled variation of oxygen tension and chondrocyte-secreted morphogenetic factors on chondrogenic differentiation of hESCs in the embryoid body format (hESC-EB).

Gene expression profiles corresponded to those associated with native cartilage development, with early expression of N-cadherin (indicator of cell condensation) and late expression of aggrecan (ACAN, indicator of proteoglycan production).

Existing techniques successfully engineer small-sized constructs with native levels of extracellular matrix (glycosaminoglycans [GAG] or collagen). However, a remaining challenge is the growth of large-sized constructs with properties similar to those of small constructs, due to consumption and transport limitations resulting in inadequate nutrient availability within the interior of large constructs. This study employed system-specific computational models for estimating glucose requirements of large constructs, with or without channels, to enhance nutrient availability. Based on glucose requirements for matrix synthesis in cartilage constructs, computational simulations were performed to identify the media volume (MV) and the number of nutrient channels (CH) needed to maintain adequate glucose levels within tissue constructs over the 3-day period between media replenishments. In Study 1, the influence of MV (5, 10, 15 mL/construct) and number of nutrient channels (CH: 0, 3, 7, 12 per construct) on glucose availability was investigated computationally for \u220510 \u00d7 2.34 mm cylindrical constructs. Results showed that the conventionally used MV 5 led to deleterious glucose depletion after only 40 h of culture, and that MV 15 was required to maintain sufficient glucose levels for all channel configurations. Study 2 examined experimentally the validity of these predictions, for tissue constructs cultured for 56 days. Matrix elaboration was highest in MV 15/CH 12 constructs (21.6% \u00b1 2.4%/ww GAG, 5.5% \u00b1 0.7%/ww collagen, normalized to wet weight (ww) on day 0), leading to the greatest amount of swelling (3.0 \u00b1 0.3 times day-0 volume), in contrast to the significantly lower matrix elaboration of conventional culture, MV 5/CH 0 (11.8% \u00b1 1.6%/ww GAG and 2.5% \u00b1 0.6%/ww collagen, 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 times day-0 volume). The computational analyses correctly predicted the need to increase the conventional media levels threefold to support matrix synthesis in large channeled engineered constructs.

Incorporation of nutrient channels into large constructs is a promising technique for alleviating transport limitations, in conjunction with simple yet effective methods for enhancing media flow through channels. Cultivation of cylindrical channeled constructs flat in culture dishes, with or without orbital shaking, produced asymmetric constructs with poor tissue properties. We therefore explored a method for exposing the entire construct surface to the culture media, while promoting flow through the channels. To this end, chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs (\u220510mm, 2.34mm thick), with zero or three nutrient channels (\u22051mm), were suspended on their sides in custom culture racks and subjected to three media stirring modes for 56 days: uniaxial rocking, orbital shaking, or static control. Orbital shaking led to the highest construct EY, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), and collagen contents, whereas rocking had detrimental effects on sGAG and collagen versus static control. Nutrient channels increased EY as well as sGAG homogeneity, and the beneficial effects of channels were most marked in orbitally shaken samples. Under these conditions, the constructs developed symmetrically and reached or exceeded native levels of EY (~400kPa) and sGAG (~9%/ww).

We have previously shown that M1 macrophages initiate angiogenesis while M2 macrophages promote vessel maturation.

To this end, we first analyzed the in vitro kinetics of macrophage phenotype switch using flow cytometry, gene expression, and cytokine secretion analysis. Then, we designed scaffolds for bone regeneration based on modifications of decellularized bone for a short release of interferon-gamma (IFNg) to promote the M1 phenotype, followed by a more sustained release of interleukin-4 (IL4) to promote the M2 phenotype. To achieve this sequential release profile, IFNg was physically adsorbed onto the scaffolds, while IL4 was attached via biotin-streptavidin binding. Interestingly, despite the strong interactions between biotin and streptavidin, release studies showed that biotinylated IL4 was released over 6 days. These scaffolds promoted sequential M1 and M2 polarization of primary human macrophages as measured by gene expression of ten M1 and M2 markers and secretion of four cytokines, although the overlapping phases of IFNg and IL4 release tempered polarization to some extent. Murine subcutaneous implantation model showed increased vascularization in scaffolds releasing IFNg compared to controls.

Regional depletion of the Nanog transcriptional regulator was achieved through the exposure of cells to microfluidic gradients of morphogens. In this way, we established pluripotency-differentiation boundaries between Nanog expressing cells (pluripotency zone) and Nanog suppressed cells (early differentiation zone) within the same cell population, with a gradient of Nanog expression across the individual cell colonies, to serve as a mimic of the developmental process.

In particular, the purinergic, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-mediated signaling pathway is strongly implicated in mechanotransduction within the articular cartilage. We investigated the effects of transient and continuous exogenous ATP supplementation on mechanical properties of cartilaginous constructs engineered using bovine chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) encapsulated in an agarose hydrogel. For both cell types, we have observed significant increases in equilibrium and dynamic compressive moduli after transient ATP treatment applied in the fourth week of cultivation. Continuous ATP treatment over 4 weeks of culture only slightly improved the mechanical properties of the constructs, without major changes in the total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen content. Structure-function analyses showed that transiently ATP-treated constructs, and in particular those based on hMSCs, had the highest level of correlation between compositional and mechanical properties. Transiently treated groups showed intense staining of the territorial matrix for GAGs and collagen type II.

To this end, we explored the potential of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) as a single-cell source for osteogenic and endothelial differentiation and the assembly of bone and vascular compartments within the same scaffold. hASCs were encapsulated in fibrin hydrogel as an angioinductive material for vascular formation, combined with a porous silk fibroin sponge to support osteogenesis, and subjected to sequential application of growth factors. Three strategies were evaluated by changing spatiotemporal cues: (a) induction of osteogenesis prior to vasculogenesis; (b) induction of vasculogenesis prior to osteogenesis; or (c) simultaneous induction of osteogenesis and vasculogenesis. By 5 weeks of culture, bone-like tissue development was evidenced by the deposition of bone matrix proteins, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, along with the formation of vascular networks, evidenced by endothelial cell surface markers, such as CD31 and von Willebrand factor, and morphometric analysis. Most robust development of the two tissue compartments was achieved by sequential induction of osteogenesis followed by the induction of vasculogenesis. Taken together, the collected data strongly support the utility of hASCs as a single-cell source for the formation of vascularized bone tissue.", "Keywords": ["bone", "human adipose stem cells", "osteogenesis", "silk scaffolds", "tissue engineering", "vasculogenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Alkaline Phosphatase", "Biomarkers", "Bone Transplantation", "Calcification, Physiologic", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Osteogenesis", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Correia", "Affiliation": "3Bs Research Group, Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal; ICVS/3Bs-PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Warren", "Last Name": "Grayson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Eton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Gimble", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rui A", "Last Name": "Sousa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rui L", "Last Name": "Reis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "PubDate": "2014Aug"}, {"PMID": "22903635", "Title": "Macrophages modulate the viability and growth of human mesenchymal stem cells.", "Abstract": "Following myocardial infarction, tissue repair is mediated by the recruitment of monocytes and their subsequent differentiation into macrophages. Recent findings have revealed the dynamic changes in the presence of polarized macrophages with pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) properties during the early (acute) and late (chronic) stages of cardiac ischemia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivered into the injured myocardium as reparative cells are subjected to the effects of polarized macrophages and the inflammatory milieu. The present study investigated how cytokines and polarized macrophages associated with pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) responses affect the survival of MSCs. Human MSCs were studied using an in vitro platform with individual and combined M1 and M2 cytokines: IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (for M1), and IL-10, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b23, and VEGF (for M2). In addition, polarization molecules (M1: LPS and IFN-\u03b3; M2: IL-4 and IL-13) and common chemokines (SDF-1 and MCP-1) found during inflammation were also studied. Indirect and direct co-cultures were conducted using M1 and M2 polarized human THP-1 monocytes. M2 macrophages and their associated cytokines supported the growth of hMSCs, while M1 macrophages and their associated cytokines inhibited the growth of hMSCs in vitro under certain conditions. These data imply that an anti-inflammatory (M2) environment is more accommodating to the therapeutic hMSCs than a pro-inflammatory (M1) environment at specific concentrations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Communication", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Coculture Techniques", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Models, Biological", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald O", "Last Name": "Freytes", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jung W", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Marcos-Campos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
