However, our ability to study the long-term course of esophageal strictures in patients with EoE is hampered by the short-term existence of this disease. It is unclear to what degree of control of inflammation is needed to prevent stricture formation. Additionally, identified phenotypes of EoE may ultimately dictate different levels of concern and time intervals for developing fibrosis. Currently, multiple methods are used to monitor patients' disease progression to fibrosis, as symptoms alone do not correlate with disease activity. Endoscopic findings and mucosal histology are used to monitor disease activity, but these focus on improvements in inflammation with inconsistent evaluation of underlying fibrosis. The use of functional lumen impedance planimetry, barium esophagraphy, and endoscopic ultrasound continues to expand in EoE. The rapid advancements in EoE have led to an armamentarium of measuring tools and therapies that holistically characterize disease severity and response to therapy. Nevertheless, our ability to evaluate gross esophageal fibrosis and stricture formation from a transmural rather than mucosal view should be a focus of future investigations because it is essential to monitoring and modulating the trajectory of EoE.", "Keywords": ["Eosinophilic esophagitis", "barium esophagography", "fibrosis", "fibrostenotic", "functional lumen imaging probe", "strictures"], "MeSH terms": ["Eosinophilic Esophagitis", "Humans", "Disease Progression", "Esophageal Stenosis", "Esophagus", "Fibrosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sydney F", "Last Name": "Pomenti", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Dominique D", "Last Name": "Bailey", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Katzka", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.

Herein, we describe our process, highlighting milestones and issues addressed since the committee's inception, which we hope will inspire other researchers to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in their fields. Our journey began by establishing mission and vision statements to define the purpose of the committee. Regular discussion of diversity-related topics was incorporated into existing meetings and web-based materials were shared. This was followed by educational initiatives, including establishing a library of relevant publications and a speaker series to address DEIA topics. We then established a research agenda focused on the following actionable items: (1) to define what is known about the demographics of EGIDs by systematic review of population-based studies; (2) to develop a practical tool for reporting participant demographics to reduce bias in EGID literature; (3) to examine health disparities in the care of individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis who present to the emergency department with an esophageal food impaction; (4) to examine how access to a gastroenterologist affects the conclusions of published research examining the prevalence of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis; and (5) to develop a model for examining the dimensions of diversity, and provide a framework for CEGIR's ongoing projects and data capture. In addition to promoting consciousness of DEIA, this initiative has fostered inclusivity among CEGIR members and will continue to inspire positive changes in EGID care and research.", "Keywords": ["diversity", "eosinophilic esophagitis", "eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases", "equity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mirna", "Last Name": "Chehade", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

To identify whether anatomic variant transplants differ in occurrence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency that could contribute to fat malabsorption, we measured FPE repeatedly in 54 recipients of a SBT, ages 6.2 to 320\u00a0months. FPE determination most distant from SBT was 6.1\u00a0years. Of the 54, 39% received an isolated intestinal graft (native pancreas only), 48% received an en bloc liver-intestinal-pancreas graft (native and graft pancreas), and 13% received a multivisceral graft (graft pancreas only). Initial FPE was normal (>200\u00a0\u03bcg/g) in 15 of the 54 at a median of 22 (11-61) days after SBT. Recipients of a liver-intestine-pancreas transplant were more likely to have normal FPE within 30\u00a0days after SBT than were isolated intestinal or multivisceral transplant recipients (47%, 19%, and 0%, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a0.049). Of the remaining 39 patients, 34 eventually demonstrated a normal FPE at a median of 168 (31-943) days after SBT. Type of SBT did not influence the likelihood of achieving a normal FPE level or time when it occurred. Five (9%) patients failed to achieve normal FPE, including 3 who died within 2\u00a0years after SBT. In conclusion, possessing both graft and native pancreas as in transplantation of an en bloc liver-intestinal-pancreas graft facilitates early normalization of FPE that eventually occurs in most patients irrespective of transplant type.
