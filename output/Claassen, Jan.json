The key determinants of functional outcome include early brain injury, rebleeding of the ruptured aneurysm and delayed cerebral ischaemia. The only effective way to reduce the risk of rebleeding is to secure the ruptured aneurysm quickly. Prompt diagnosis, transfer to specialized centers, and meticulous management in the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly improved the prognosis of aSAH. Recently, multimodality monitoring with specific interventions to correct pathophysiological imbalances has been proposed. Vigilance extends beyond intracranial concerns to encompass systemic respiratory and haemodynamic monitoring, as derangements in these systems can precipitate secondary brain damage. Challenges persist in treating aSAH patients, exacerbated by a paucity of robust clinical evidence, with many interventions showing no benefit when tested in rigorous clinical trials. Given the growing body of literature in this field and the issuance of contemporary guidelines, our objective is to furnish an updated review of essential principles of ICU management for this patient population. Our review will discuss the epidemiology, initial stabilization, treatment strategies, long-term prognostic factors, the identification and management of post-aSAH complications.

We aim to investigate rsEEG measures and their prediction of early recovery of consciousness in comatose TBI patients. Methods This is a retrospective study of comatose TBI patients who were admitted to a level-1 trauma center (10/2013-1/2022). Demographics, basic clinical data, imaging characteristics, and EEG data were collected. We calculated using 10-minute rsEEGs: power spectral density (PSD), permutation entropy (PE - complexity measure), weighted symbolic-mutual-information (wSMI - global information sharing measure), Kolmogorov complexity (Kolcom - complexity measure), and heart-evoked potentials (HEP - the averaged EEG signal relative to the corresponding QRS complex on electrocardiogram). We evaluated the prediction of consciousness recovery before hospital discharge using clinical, imaging, rsEEG data via Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel (SVM). Results We studied 113 (out of 134, 84%) patients with rsEEGs. A total of 73 (65%) patients recovered consciousness before discharge.

Management that follows published guidelines is best suited to improve outcomes, with the most severe cases frequently being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Diagnosis of convulsive SE can be made without electroencephalography (EEG), but EEG is required to reliably diagnose nonconvulsive SE. Rapidly narrowing down underlying causes for SE is crucial, as this may guide additional management steps. Causes may range from underlying epilepsy to acute brain injuries such as trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke, and infections. Initial management consists of rapid administration of benzodiazepines and one of the following non-sedating intravenous antiseizure medications (ASM): (fos-)phenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate; other ASM are increasingly used, such as lacosamide or brivaracetam. SE that continues despite these medications is called refractory, and most commonly treated with continuous infusions of midazolam or propofol. Alternatives include further non-sedating ASM and non-pharmacologic approaches. SE that reemerges after weaning or continues despite management with propofol or midazolam is labeled super-refractory SE. At this step, management may include non-sedating or sedating compounds including ketamine and barbiturates. Continuous video EEG is necessary for the management of refractory and super-refractory SE, as these are almost always nonconvulsive.

We investigated responsiveness to videos with and without audio in traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects using video eye-tracking (VET). We recruited 20 healthy volunteers and 10 unresponsive TBI subjects. Clinicians were surveyed whether the subject was tracking on their bedside assessment. The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) was also performed. Eye movements in response to three different 30-second videos with and without sound were recorded using VET. The videos consisted of moving characters (a dancer, a person skateboarding, and Spiderman). Tracking on VET was defined as visual fixation on the character and gaze movement in the same direction of the character on two separate occasions. Subjects were classified as \"covert tracking\" (tracking using VET only), \"overt tracking\" (VET and clinical exam by clinicians), and \"no tracking\". A k-nearest-neighbors model was also used to identify tracking computationally. Thalamocortical connectivity and structural integrity were evaluated with EEG and MRI. The ability to obey commands was evaluated at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The average age was 29 (\u00b1\u200917) years old. Three subjects demonstrated \"covert tracking\" (CRS-R of 6, 8, 7), two \"overt tracking\" (CRS-R 22, 11), and five subjects \"no tracking\" (CRS-R 8, 6, 5, 6, 7). Among the 84 tested trials in all subjects, 11 trials (13%) met the criteria for \"covert tracking\". Using the k-nearest approach, 14 trials (17%) were classified as \"covert tracking\". Subjects with \"tracking\" had higher thalamocortical connectivity, and had fewer structures injured in the eye-tracking network than those without tracking. At follow-up, 2 out of 3 \"covert\" and all \"overt\" subjects recovered consciousness versus only 2 subjects in the \"no tracking\" group.

CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown. By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively. Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients [ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006], but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz [odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9] and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection.

The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for automatically identifying segments of intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform data from external ventricular drainage (EVD) recordings during intermittent drainage and closure.Methods. The proposed method uses time-frequency analysis through wavelets to distinguish periods of ICP waveform in EVD data. By comparing the frequency compositions of the ICP signals (when the EVD system is clamped) and the artifacts (when the system is open), the algorithm can detect short, uninterrupted segments of ICP waveform from the longer periods of non-measurement data. The method involves applying a wavelet transform, calculating the absolute power in a specific range, using Otsu thresholding to automatically identify a threshold, and performing a morphological operation to remove small segments. Two investigators manually graded the same randomly selected one-hour segments of the resulting processed data. Performance metrics were calculated as a percentage.Results. The study analyzed data from 229 patients who had EVD placed following subarachnoid hemorrhage between June 2006 and December 2012. Of these, 155 (67.7%) were female and 62 (27%) developed delayed cerebral ischemia. A total of 45 150 h of data were segmented. 2044 one-hour segments were randomly selected and evaluated by two investigators (MM and DN). Of those, the evaluators agreed on the classification of 1556 one-hour segments. The algorithm was able to correctly identify 86% (1338 h) of ICP waveform data. 8.2% (128 h) of the time the algorithm either partially or fully failed to segment the ICP waveform. 5.4% (84 h) of data, artifacts were mistakenly identified as ICP waveforms (false positives).Conclusion. The proposed algorithm automates the identification of valid ICP waveform segments of waveform in EVD data and thus enables the inclusion in real-time data analysis for decision support. It also standardizes and makes research data management more efficient.", "Keywords": ["intracranial pressure", "neurocritical care", "signal processing", "wavelet analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Male", "Constriction", "Intracranial Pressure", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Wavelet Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Murad", "Last Name": "Megjhani", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kalijah", "Last Name": "Terilli", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Soon Bin", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Nametz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bennett", "Last Name": "Weinerman", "Affiliation": "Program for Hospital and Intensive Care Informatics, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Velazquez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shivani", "Last Name": "Ghoshal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "Physiological measurement", "PubDate": "2023Jul04"}, {"PMID": "37232240", "Title": "Red Blood Cell Transfusions Are Not Associated With Incident Complications or Poor Outcomes in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Background Anemia is associated with poor intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes, yet the relationship of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to ICH complications and functional outcomes remains unclear. We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]). After adjusting for disease severity and other relevant covariates, we found no significant association between RBC transfusion and mortality (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.45-1.66]) or poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score (aOR, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.80-7.61]).

The most common indication for EEG monitoring currently is the management of refractory status epilepticus. In addition, a number of studies have associated frequent seizures, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), with worsening secondary brain injury and with worse outcomes. With the widespread utilization of EEG (spot and continuous EEG), rhythmic and periodic patterns that do not fulfill strict seizure criteria have been identified, epidemiologically quantified, and linked to pathophysiological events across a wide spectrum of critical and acute illnesses, including acute brain injury. Increasingly, EEG is not just qualitatively described, but also quantitatively analyzed together with other modalities to generate innovative measurements with possible clinical relevance. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge and emerging applications of EEG in the ICU, including seizure detection, ischemia monitoring, detection of cortical spreading depolarizations, assessment of consciousness and prognostication. We also review some technical aspects and challenges of using EEG in the ICU including the logistics of setting up ICU EEG monitoring in resource-limited settings.", "Keywords": ["Cortical spreading depolarization", "Disorders of consciousness", "Electroencephalogram", "Intensive care unit", "Ischemia", "Nonconvulsive seizures", "Status epilepticus"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Injuries", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Seizures", "Status Epilepticus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ayham", "Last Name": "Alkhachroum", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Appavu", "Affiliation": "Department of Child Health and Neurology, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Egawa", "Affiliation": "Neurointensive Care Unit, Department of Neurosurgery, and Stroke and Epilepsy Center, TMG Asaka Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Foreman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Cincinnati, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Gaspard", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Erasme Hospital, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Gilmore", "Affiliation": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence J", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Kurtz", "Affiliation": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, D'or Institute for Research and Education, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Virginie", "Last Name": "Lambrecq", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology and Epilepsy Unit, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, Reference Center for Rare Epilepsies, 75013, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Kromm", "Affiliation": "Departments of Critical Care Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Vespa", "Affiliation": "Brain Injury Research Center, Department of Neurosurgery, University of California, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sahar F", "Last Name": "Zafar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Rohaut", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re-AP-HP and Paris Brain Institute, ICM, Inserm, CNRS, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, New York Presbyterian Hospital, 177 Fort Washington Avenue, MHB 8 Center, Room 300, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jc1439@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Intensive care medicine", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "35985353", "Title": "Spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the third most common subtype of stroke. Incidence has decreased over past decades, possibly in part related to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and management of hypertension. Approximately a quarter of patients with SAH die before hospital admission; overall outcomes are improved in those admitted to hospital, but with elevated risk of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae such as depression. The disease continues to have a major public health impact as the mean age of onset is in the mid-fifties, leading to many years of reduced quality of life. The clinical presentation varies, but severe, sudden onset of headache is the most common symptom, variably associated with meningismus, transient or prolonged unconsciousness, and focal neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies and paresis. Diagnosis is made by CT scan of the head possibly followed by lumbar puncture. Aneurysms are commonly the underlying vascular cause of spontaneous SAH and are diagnosed by angiography. Emergent therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing the risk of rebleeding (ie, preventing hypertension and correcting coagulopathies) and, most crucially, early aneurysm treatment using coil embolisation or clipping. Management of the disease is best delivered in specialised intensive care units and high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team. Increasingly, early brain injury presenting as global cerebral oedema is recognised as a potential treatment target but, currently, disease management is largely focused on addressing secondary complications such as hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischaemia related to microvascular dysfunction and large vessel vasospasm, and medical complications such as stunned myocardium and hospital acquired infections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Intracranial Aneurysm", "Quality of Life", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.

Accurate, reliable, and efficient quantification of these volumes will be paramount to their utility as measures of treatment effect in future clinical studies. Both manual and semi-automated quantification methods of hematoma and perihematomal edema volumetry are time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability. Efforts are now underway to develop a fully automated algorithm that can replace them. A (QUANTUM) study to establish inter-quantification method measurement equivalency, which deviates from the traditional use of measures of agreement and a comparison hypothesis testing paradigm to indirectly infer quantification method measurement equivalence, is described in this article. The Quantification of Hematoma and Perihematomal Edema Volumes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage study aims to determine whether a fully automated quantification method and a semi-automated quantification method for quantification of hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes are equivalent to the hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes of the manual quantification method.", "Keywords": ["Stroke",

presentations and discussions at the 2nd Curing Coma National Institutes of Health (NIH) symposium held from May 3 to May 5, 2021. Here, we summarize the background, research priorities, panel discussions, and deliverables discussed during the symposium across six major domains related to disorders of consciousness. The six domains include (1) Biology of Coma, (2) Coma Database, (3) Neuroprognostication, (4) Care of Comatose Patients, (5) Early Clinical Trials, and (6) Long-term Recovery. Following the 1st Curing Coma NIH virtual symposium held on September 9 to September 10, 2020, six workgroups, each consisting of field experts in respective domains, were formed and tasked with identifying gaps and developing key priorities and deliverables to advance the mission of the Curing Coma Campaign. The highly interactive and inspiring presentations and panel discussions during the 3-day virtual NIH symposium identified several action items for the Curing Coma Campaign mission, which we summarize in this article.", "Keywords": ["Coma", "Curing Coma Campaign", "Disorders of consciousness", "National Institute of Health", "Proceedings"], "MeSH terms": ["Coma", "Consciousness", "Consciousness

While risk factors for COVID-19 have been described, COVID-19 endotypes have not been elucidated. Objectives: We sought to identify and describe COVID-19 endotypes of hospitalized patients. Methods: Consensus clustering (using the ensemble method) of patient age and laboratory values during admission identified endotypes. We analyzed data from 528 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to telemetry capable beds at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and discharged between March 12 to July 15, 2020. Results: Four unique endotypes were identified and described by laboratory values, demographics, outcomes, and treatments. Endotypes 1 and 2 were comprised of low numbers of intubated patients (1 and 6%) and exhibited low mortality (1 and 6%), whereas endotypes 3 and 4 included high numbers of intubated patients (72 and 85%) with elevated mortality (21 and 43%). Endotypes 2 and 4 had the most comorbidities. Endotype 1 patients had low levels of inflammatory markers (ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH), low infectious markers (WBC, procalcitonin), and low degree of coagulopathy (PTT, PT), while endotype 4 had higher levels of those markers. Conclusions: Four unique endotypes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified, which segregated patients based on inflammatory markers, infectious markers, evidence of end-organ dysfunction, comorbidities, and outcomes. High comorbidities did not associate with poor outcome endotypes. Further work is needed to validate these endotypes in other cohorts and to study endotype differences to treatment responses.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "cluster analysis", "endotype", "machine

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

and may be associated with harm. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise.

of consciousness: mechanisms, prognosis and emerging therapies.", "Abstract": "Substantial progress has been made over the past two decades in detecting, predicting and promoting recovery of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) caused by severe brain injuries. Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15-20% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1\u2009year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness. In this Review, we focus on mechanisms of recovery from DoC in the acute and subacute-to-chronic stages, and we discuss recent progress in detecting and predicting recovery of consciousness. We also describe the developments in pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies that are creating new opportunities to improve the lives of patients with DoC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Consciousness", "Consciousness Disorders", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Recovery of Function"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian L", "Last Name": "Edlow", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas D", "Last Name": "Schiff", "Affiliation": "Feil Family Brain Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Greer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA. dgreer@bu.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

Gaps exist in patient assessment, outcome prognostication, and treatment directed specifically at improving consciousness and cognitive recovery. In 2019, the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS)\u00a0launched the Curing Coma Campaign in order to address the \"grand challenge\" of improving the management of patients with coma and decreased consciousness. One of the first steps was to bring together a Scientific Advisory Council including coma scientists, neurointensivists, neurorehabilitationists, and implementation experts in order to address the current scientific landscape and begin to develop a framework on how to move forward. This manuscript describes the proceedings of the first Curing Coma Campaign Scientific Advisory Council meeting which occurred in conjunction with the NCS Annual Meeting in October 2019 in Vancouver. Specifically, three major pillars were identified which should be considered: endotyping of coma and disorders of consciousness, biomarkers, and proof-of-concept clinical trials. Each is summarized with regard to current approach, benefits to the patient, family, and clinicians, and next steps. Integration of these three pillars will be essential to the success of the Curing Coma Campaign as will expanding the \"curing coma community\" to ensure broad participation of clinicians, scientists, and patient advocates with the goal of identifying and implementing treatments to fundamentally improve the outcome of patients.", "Keywords": ["Biomarker", "Coma", "Consciousness", "Endotype",

Instead, time consuming and subjective assessments are used. However, many brain and physiologic variables are measured continuously in neurological ICU, and could be used as indicators for consciousness. Since many biological variables are highly correlated to maintain homeostasis, we examine whether changes in time lags between correlated variables may relate to changes in consciousness. We introduce new methods to identify changes in the time lag of correlations, which better handle noisy multimodal physiological data and fluctuating lags. On neurological ICU data from subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, we find that correlations among variables related to brain physiology or respiration have significantly longer lags inpatients with decreased levels of consciousness than in patients with higher levels of consciousness. This suggests that physiological data could potentially be used to automatically assess consciousness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Consciousness", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Models, Biological", "Patient Acuity", "Research Design", "Stroke", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Unconsciousness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tahsin T", "Last Name": "Yavuz", "Affiliation": "Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Kleinberg", "Affiliation": "Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ."}], "Journal": "AMIA ...

We sought to identify predictors and the long-term impact of treatment failure with hypertensive therapy for symptomatic vasospasm. Methods- We performed a retrospective analysis of 1520 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients prospectively enrolled in the Columbia University SAH Outcomes Project between August 1996 and August 2012. One hundred ninety-eight symptomatic vasospasm patients were treated with vasopressors to raise arterial blood pressure, with and without volume expansion. Treatment response, defined as complete or near-complete resolution of the initial neurological deficit, was adjudicated in weekly meetings of the study team based on serial clinical examination after hypertensive treatment. Outcome was evaluated at 1 year with the modified Rankin Scale. Results- Twenty-one percent of the 198 patients who received hypertensive therapy did not respond to treatment. Treatment failure was associated with an increased risk of death or severe disability at 1 year (modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6; 62% versus 25%; P<0.001). Failure of medical therapy was also associated with an admission troponin I level >0.3 \u03bcg/L (64% versus 28%; P=0.001), aneurysm coiling (43% versus 20%; P=0.004), and involvement of >1 symptomatic vascular territory at onset (39% versus 22%; P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, treatment failure was independently associated only with troponin I elevation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.69-11.09; P=0.002). Conclusions- Failure to respond to induced hypertension for symptomatic vasospasm threatens 1-year outcome. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with symptomatic vasospasm who have elevated initial troponin I levels, indicative of neurogenic cardiac injury, are at twice the risk of medical treatment failure. Expedited endovascular therapy should be considered in these patients.", "Keywords": ["hypertension", "risk factors", "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "treatment failure", "vasospasm"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Treatment Failure", "Vasoconstrictor Agents", "Vasospasm, Intracranial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sureerat", "Last Name": "Suwatcharangkoon", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand (S.S.)."}, {"First Name": "Gian Marco", "Last Name": "De Marchis", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Witsch", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Velazquez", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Falo", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery (E.S.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Departments of Neurology (S.S., G.M.D.M., J.W., E.M., A.V., C.F., J.M.S., S.A., J.C.), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stephan A", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI (S.A.M.)."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2019Jul"}, {"PMID": "31119687", "Title": "Common Data Elements for Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms and Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Recommendations from the Working Group on Hospital Course and Acute Therapies-Proposal of a Multidisciplinary Research Group.", "Abstract": "The Common Data Elements (CDEs) initiative is a National Institute of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) effort to standardize naming, definitions, data coding, and data collection for observational studies and clinical trials in major neurological disorders.

We describe a medically-refractory case of CVST in a 35-year-old woman later found to have JAK2 mutation and essential thrombocytosis. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Forty-hours of continuous-tPA in addition to systemic intravenous-heparin led to complete radiographic and clinical resolution of CVST. Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially.

However in many real-world cases, such as in biological systems, relationships are more complex, with groups of factors needed to produce an effect, or some factors only modifying other relationships rather than producing outcomes alone. For instance, weight may alter the efficacy of a drug without causing side effects itself. Such moderating factors may change the timing, intensity, or probability of a causal relationship. Distinguishing moderators from genuine causes can lead to more effective medical interventions, and better strategies for bringing about a desired effect, since a moderator alone is ineffective. However, there have not yet been algorithms to automatically infer moderators in a large-scale automated way, and they cannot be easily read off from causal graphs. We introduce a set of temporal logic rules to automatically identify the asymmetric roles of causes and moderators in a computationally efficient manner. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate that even in challenging cases we can find moderators and avoid confounding, and on real neurological ICU data we show how the approach can find more descriptive and meaningful relationships than the state of the art.", "Keywords": ["causality", "health informatics", "time series"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Kleinberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science Stevens, Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of machine learning research", "PubDate": "2018Aug"}, {"PMID": "30120039", "Title": "Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data.", "Abstract": "Intracerebral haemorrhage growth is associated with poor clinical outcome and is a therapeutic target for improving outcome.

Acute evaluation with blood, imaging and electroencephalographic monitoring will be performed and then patients will be tracked for 2\u202fyears to determine the incidence of PTE. Validation of selected biomarkers that are discovered in planned animal models will be a principal feature of this work.

These periodic discharges present a clinical challenge: some patterns may reflect brain injury that has already occurred, although there is evidence that some periodic discharges represent an ongoing process causing additional brain injury and necessitate treatment. Herein, we review the available data regarding the clinical significance of different categories of periodic discharges, specifically those that have features physiologically similar to seizures. We propose a stepwise approach to assessment and management of periodic discharges and lay out the general paradigm of (1) clinical assessment including benzodiazepine trial, (2) EEG assessment, with a focus on discharge frequency, and (3) integration of adjunctive data such as neuroimaging and metabolic data when available. A flowchart is provided to simplify and summarize this approach.

Similarly, overweight patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) have improved survival up to 1 year after admission. These counterintuitive observations are examples of the \"obesity paradox.\" Does the obesity paradox exist in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)? In this study the authors examined whether there was an association between obesity and functional outcome in patients with ICH.METHODSThe authors analyzed 202 patients admitted to the neurological ICU (NICU) who were prospectively enrolled in the Columbia University ICH Outcomes Project between September 2009 and December 2012. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: overweight (body mass index [BMI] \u2265 25 kg/m2) and not overweight (BMI < 25 kg/m2). The primary outcome was defined as survival with favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-3) versus death or severe disability (mRS score 4-6) at 3 months.RESULTSThe mean age of the patients in the study was 61 years. The mean BMI was 28 \u00b1 6 kg/m2. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 \u00b1 4 and the mean ICH score was 1.9 \u00b1 1.3. The overall 90-day mortality rate was 41%.

In this study, the authors assessed the factors associated with the occurrence of multiple aneurysms in patients presenting with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS Consecutive patients presenting with aneurysmal SAH between 1996 and 2012 were prospectively enrolled in the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Outcome Project. Patients harboring 1, 2, or 3 or more aneurysms were stratified into groups, and the clinical and radiological characteristics of each group were compared using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Of 1277 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, 890 had 1 aneurysm, 267 had 2 aneurysms, and 120 had 3 or more aneurysms. On multinomial regression using the single-aneurysm cohort as base case, risk factors for patients presenting with 2 aneurysms were female sex (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1.80, p < 0.001), higher body mass index (BMI) (RRR 1.02, p = 0.003), more years of smoking (RRR = 1.01, p = 0.004), and black race (RRR 1.83, p = 0.001). The risk factors for patients presenting with 3 or more aneurysms were female sex (RRR 3.10, p < 0.001), higher BMI (RRR 1.03, p < 0.001), aneurysm in the posterior circulation (RRR 2.59, p < 0.001), and black race (RRR 2.15, p = 0.001). Female sex, longer smoking history, aneurysms in the posterior circulation, BMI, and black race were independently associated with the development of multiple aneurysms in our adjusted multivariate multinomial model.

Twenty patients were included, of whom half had DCI median 4.7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 4.0-5.6) from SAH bleed. The rate of decline in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was significant in both those with and without DCI and occurred between days 4 and 7 post-SAH.

Spreading depolarizations are increasingly recorded during multimodal neuromonitoring in neurocritical care as a causal biomarker providing a diagnostic summary measure of metabolic failure and excitotoxic injury. Focal ischemia causes spreading depolarization within minutes. Further spreading depolarizations arise for hours to days due to energy supply-demand mismatch in viable tissue. Spreading depolarizations exacerbate neuronal injury through prolonged ionic breakdown and spreading depolarization-related hypoperfusion (spreading ischemia). Local duration of the depolarization indicates local tissue energy status and risk of injury. Regional electrocorticographic monitoring affords even remote detection of injury because spreading depolarizations propagate widely from ischemic or metabolically stressed zones; characteristic patterns, including temporal clusters of spreading depolarizations and persistent depression of spontaneous cortical activity, can be recognized and quantified. Here, we describe the experimental basis for interpreting these patterns and illustrate their translation to human disease. We further provide consensus recommendations for electrocorticographic methods to record, classify, and score spreading depolarizations and associated spreading depressions. These methods offer distinct advantages over other neuromonitoring modalities and allow for future refinement through less invasive and more automated approaches.", "Keywords": ["Spreading

The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome. METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up. RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment.

While massive amounts of data make it difficult for clinicians to extract meaningful signals, these data could provide insight into the state of critically ill patients and guide interventions. We develop uniquely customized computational methods to uncover the causal structure within systemic and brain physiologic measures recorded in a neurological intensive care unit after subarachnoid hemorrhage. While the data have many missing values, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and are composed from a heterogeneous patient population, our advanced imputation and causal inference techniques enable physiologic models to be learned for individuals. Our analyses confirm that complex physiologic relationships including demand and supply of oxygen underlie brain oxygen measurements and that mechanisms for brain swelling early after injury may differ from those that develop in a delayed fashion. These inference methods will enable wider use of ICU data to understand patient physiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Brain Injuries", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Female", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nervous System Physiological Phenomena", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shah Atiqur", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yuxiao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Peter", "Last Name": "Frey", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cristina Maria", "Last Name": "Falo", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Kleinberg", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26992857", "Title": "Global cerebral edema from hypercapnic respiratory acidosis and response to hyperosmolar therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acidosis, Respiratory", "Adult", "Brain Edema", "Humans", "Hypercapnia", "Male", "Osmolar Concentration", "Sodium Chloride"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY. dr2753@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alexander E", "Last Name": "Merkler", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2016Apr19"}, {"PMID": "26971295", "Title": "Acute effects of intraventricular nicardipine on cerebral hemodynamics: A preliminary finding.", "Abstract": "Intraventricular nicardipine (IVTN) is a treatment option for severe vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

A patient's record may be split across multiple institutions, devices may fail, and sensors may not be worn at all times. While these missing values are often ignored, this can lead to bias and error when the data are mined. Further, the data are not simply missing at random. Instead the measurement of a variable such as blood glucose may depend on its prior values as well as that of other variables. These dependencies exist across time as well, but current methods have yet to incorporate these temporal relationships as well as multiple types of missingness. To address this, we propose an imputation method (FLk-NN) that incorporates time lagged correlations both within and across variables by combining two imputation methods, based on an extension to k-NN and the Fourier transform. This enables imputation of missing values even when all data at a time point is missing and when there are different types of missingness both within and across variables. In comparison to other approaches on three biological datasets (simulated and actual Type 1 diabetes datasets, and multi-modality neurological ICU monitoring) the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy. This was true for up to half the data being missing and when consecutive missing values are a significant fraction of the overall time series length.", "Keywords": ["Biomedical data", "Imputation", "Missing data", "Time series"], "MeSH terms": ["Fourier Analysis", "Models, Theoretical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shah Atiqur", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, United States.

The objective of this review is to report on the International Microdialysis Forum held in Cambridge, UK, in April 2014 and to produce a revised and updated consensus statement about its clinical use including technique, data interpretation, relationship with outcome, role in guiding therapy in neurocritical care and research applications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Microdialysis", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "Hutchinson", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Box 167, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK, pjah2@cam.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Ibrahim", "Last Name": "Jalloh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adel", "Last Name": "Helmy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Keri L H", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elham", "Last Name": "Rostami", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bo-Michael", "Last Name": "Bellander", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martyn G", "Last Name": "Boutelle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeff W", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Dahyot-Fizelier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Per", "Last Name": "Enblad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clare N", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raimund", "Last Name": "Helbok", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Hillered", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Le Roux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Magnoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Halinder S", "Last Name": "Mangat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David K", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carl-Henrik", "Last Name": "Nordstr\u00f6m", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristine H", "Last Name": "O'Phelan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "Oddo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jon", "Last Name": "Perez Barcena", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Robertson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Ronne-Engstr\u00f6m", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Sahuquillo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nino", "Last Name": "Stocchetti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Belli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "T Adrian", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan P", "Last Name": "Coles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Czosnyka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nil", "Last Name": "Dizdar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Clay", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arun K", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Troels H", "Last Name": "Nielsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Niklas", "Last Name": "Marklund", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ambroise", "Last Name": "Montcriol", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark T", "Last Name": "O'Connell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria A", "Last Name": "Poca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Asita", "Last Name": "Sarrafzadeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Shannon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "Skj\u00f8th-Rasmussen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Smielewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Stover", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Timofeev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Vespa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Zavala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Urban", "Last Name": "Ungerstedt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Intensive care medicine", "PubDate": "2015Sep"}, {"PMID": "26160466", "Title": "Adverse Outcomes After Initial Non-surgical Management of Subdural Hematoma: A Population-Based Study.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the natural history of non-surgically managed subdural hematoma (SDH).

Although previous studies have found that the mortality and morbidity of ICH due to AVM (AVM-ICH) is lower than in spontaneous ICH, it is unclear whether the more favorable prognosis is directly related to the presence of the vascular malformation. We included 34 patients with AVM-ICH and 187 with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) due to either hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Patient data were obtained from the prospective Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project, which enrolls ICH patients admitted to Columbia University Medical Center. Using ICH etiology (AVM-ICH or sICH) and previously verified predictors of ICH outcome, two multivariate analyses were performed with and without age to compare the odds of death at 3 months and the functional outcome. Although mortality in AVM-ICH group was lower than the sICH group (20.6% versus 43.3%, respectively), this value was only significant when age was excluded (p=0.017) and lost its significance when we controlled for age (p=0.157). There was an analogous loss of significance with functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale. In conclusion, our data suggests that the previously observed lower case fatality rate and more favorable functional outcomes in the AVM-ICH group compared to the sICH group may largely be the result of age.", "Keywords": ["Age", "Amyloid angiopathy", "Arteriovenous malformations", "Intracerebral hemorrhage", "Prognosis", "Prospective", "Stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Blake", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Cerebrovascular Laboratory, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, Suite 5-454, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

At the same time, bioinformatics is a rapidly emerging field in critical care but as yet there is little agreement or standardization on what information is important and how it should be displayed and analyzed. The Neurocritical Care Society in collaboration with the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Society for Critical Care Medicine, and the Latin America Brain Injury Consortium organized an international, multidisciplinary consensus conference to begin to address these needs. International experts from neurosurgery, neurocritical care, neurology, critical care, neuroanesthesiology, nursing, pharmacy, and informatics were recruited on the basis of their research, publication record, and expertise. They undertook a systematic literature review to develop recommendations about specific topics on physiologic processes important to the care of patients with disorders that require neurocritical care. This review does not make recommendations about treatment, imaging, and intraoperative monitoring. A multidisciplinary jury, selected for their expertise in clinical investigation and development of practice guidelines, guided this process.

An electronic literature search was conducted for articles in English describing electrophysiological monitoring in ABI from January 1990 to August 2013. A total of 165 studies were included. EEG is a useful monitor for seizure and ischemia detection. There is a well-described role for EEG in convulsive status epilepticus and cardiac arrest (CA). Data suggest EEG should be considered in all patients with ABI and unexplained and persistent altered consciousness and in comatose intensive care unit (ICU) patients without an acute primary brain condition who have an unexplained impairment of mental status. There remain uncertainties about certain technical details, e.g., the minimum duration of EEG studies, the montage, and electrodes. Data obtained from both EEG and EP studies may help estimate prognosis in ABI patients, particularly following CA and traumatic brain injury. Data supporting these recommendations is sparse, and high quality studies are needed. EEG is used to monitor and detect seizures and ischemia in ICU patients and indications for EEG are clear for certain disease states, however, uncertainty remains on other applications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Injuries", "Brain Ischemia", "Critical Care", "Electroencephalography", "Heart Arrest", "Humans", "Patient Selection", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology and Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 177 Fort Washington Avenue, MHB 8 Center, Room 300, New York, NY, 10032, USA, jc1439@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Vespa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Participants in the International Multi-disciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurocritical care", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "25138226", "Title": "Consensus summary statement of the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care : a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.", "Abstract": "Neurocritical care depends, in part, on careful patient monitoring but as yet there are little data on what processes are the most important to monitor, how these should be monitored, and whether monitoring these processes is cost-effective and impacts outcome.

The Neurocritical Care Society in collaboration with the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Society for Critical Care Medicine, and the Latin America Brain Injury Consortium organized an international, multidisciplinary consensus conference to begin to address these needs. International experts from neurosurgery, neurocritical care, neurology, critical care, neuroanesthesiology, nursing, pharmacy, and informatics were recruited on the basis of their research, publication record, and expertise. They undertook a systematic literature review to develop recommendations about specific topics on physiologic processes important to the care of patients with disorders that require neurocritical care.
