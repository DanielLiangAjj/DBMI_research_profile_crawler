This study investigated the effect of prolonged nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in DD. Using an inducible mouse model, we genetically targeted cells expressing aggrecan, a primary component of the disc extra cellular matrix, for activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Prolonged NF-\u03baB activation led to severe structural degeneration accompanied by increases in gene expression of inflammatory molecules (Il1b, Cox2, Il6, and Nos2), chemokines (Mcp1 and Mif), and catabolic enzymes (Mmp3, Mmp9, and Adamts4). Increased recruitment of proinflammatory (F4/80+,CD38+) and inflammatory resolving (F4/80+,CD206+) macrophages was observed within caudal discs. We found that the secretome of inflamed caudal disc cells increased macrophage migration and inflammatory activation. Lumbar discs did not exhibit phenotypic changes, suggestive of regional spinal differences in response to inflammatory genetic overactivation. Results suggest prolonged NF-\u03baB activation can induce severe DD through increases in inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic proteins, catabolic enzymes, and the recruitment and activation of macrophage cell populations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration", "NF-kappa B", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Intervertebral Disc", "Disease Models, Animal", "Inflammation", "Cytokines", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kevin G", "Last Name": "Burt", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Min Kyu M", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan C", "Last Name": "Viola", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Abraham", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nadeen O", "Last Name": "Chahine", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2024Jun07"}, {"PMID": "38678396", "Title": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the productivity and career prospects of musculoskeletal researchers.", "Abstract": "Academic researchers faced a multitude of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread shelter-in-place orders, workplace closures, and cessation of in-person meetings and laboratory activities. The extent to which these challenges impacted musculoskeletal researchers, specifically, is unknown. We developed an anonymous web-based survey to determine the pandemic's impact on research productivity and career prospects among musculoskeletal research trainees and faculty. There were 116 musculoskeletal (MSK) researchers with varying demographic backgrounds who completed the survey. Of respondents, 48.3% (n\u2009=\u200956) believed that musculoskeletal funding opportunities decreased because of COVID-19, with faculty members more likely to hold this belief compared to nonfaculty researchers (p\u2009=\u20090.008). Amongst MSK researchers, 88.8% (n\u2009=\u2009103) reported research activity was limited by COVID-19, and 92.2% (n\u2009=\u2009107) of researchers reported their research was not able to be refocused on COVID-19-related topics, with basic science researchers less likely to be able to refocus their research compared to clinical researchers (p\u2009=\u20090.030). Additionally, 47.4% (n\u2009=\u200955) reported a decrease in manuscript submissions since the onset of the pandemic. Amongst 51 trainee researchers, 62.8% (n\u2009=\u200932) reported a decrease in job satisfaction directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, study findings indicated that MSK researchers struggled to overcome challenges imposed by the pandemic, reporting declines in funding opportunities, research productivity, and manuscript submission.

Components of the degenerative environment, including structural disruption and inflammatory cytokine production, often correlate with pain severity. However, the role of inflammation in the activation of pain and degenerative changes has been complex to delineate. The most common IVD injury model is puncture; however, it initiates structural damage that is not representative of the natural degenerative cascade. In this study, we utilized in\u00a0vivo injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory stimulus, into rat caudal IVDs using 33G needles to induce inflammatory activation without the physical tissue disruption caused by puncture using larger needles. LPS injection increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnfa, Il1b) and macrophage markers (Inos, Arg1), supported by immunostaining of macrophages (CD68, CCR7, Arg1) and systemic changes in blood cytokine and chemokine levels. Disruption of the IVD structural integrity after LPS injection was also evident through changes in histological grading, disc height, and ECM biochemistry. Ultimately, intradiscal inflammatory stimulation led to local mechanical hyperalgesia, demonstrating that pain can be initiated by inflammatory stimulation of the IVD. Gene expression of nociceptive markers (Ngf, Bdnf, Cgrp) and immunostaining for neuron ingrowth (PGP9.5) and sensitization (CGRP) in the IVD were also shown, suggesting a mechanism for the pain exhibited.

Recent studies have highlighted a significant role of innate immune activation, particularly that of toll-like receptors (TLRs), in IVD degeneration. Biological responses of intervertebral disc cells to loading depend on many factors that include magnitude and frequency. The goals of this study were to characterize the inflammatory signaling changes in response to static and dynamic loading of IVD and investigate the contributions of TLR4 signaling in response to mechanical loading. Rat bone-disc-bone motion segments were loaded for 3\u00a0hr under a static load (20\u00a0% strain, 0\u00a0Hz) with or without an additional low-dynamic (4\u00a0% dynamic strain, 0.5\u00a0Hz) or high-dynamic (8\u00a0% dynamic strain, 3\u00a0Hz) strain, and results were compared to unloaded controls. Some samples were also loaded with or without TAK-242, an inhibitor of TLR4 signaling. The magnitude of NO release into the loading media (LM) was correlated with the applied frequency and strain magnitudes across different loading groups. Injurious loading profiles, such as static and high-dynamic, significantly increased Tlr4 and Hmgb1 expression while this result was not observed in the more physiologically relevant low-dynamic loading group. TAK-242 co-treatment decreased pro-inflammatory expression in static but not dynamic loaded groups, suggesting that TLR4 plays a direct role in mediating inflammatory responses of IVD to static compression.

We hypothesize that this cartilage maintenance is mediated in part by cells derived from the synovium that migrate to the worn articular surface. Here, we demonstrate in vitro that the early steps required for such a process can occur. First, we show that under physiologic mechanical loads, chondrocyte death occurs in the cartilage superficial zone along with changes to the cartilage surface topography. Second, we show that synoviocytes are released from the synovial lining under physiologic loads and attach to worn cartilage.

Appropriate preclinical models for intervertebral disc research are essential to achieving a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and for the development, evaluation, and translation of more effective treatments. To this end, in vivo animal and ex vivo organ culture models are both widely used by spine researchers; however, the relative strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are a source of ongoing controversy. In this article, members from the Spine and Preclinical Models Sections of the Orthopedic Research Society, including experts in both basic and translational spine research, present contrasting arguments in support of in vivo animal models versus ex vivo organ culture models for studies of the disc, supported by a comprehensive review of the relevant literature. The objective is to provide a deeper understanding of the respective advantages and limitations of these approaches, and advance the field toward a consensus with respect to appropriate model selection and implementation.

In this study, we use 3D printing of flexible polylactic acid (FPLA) to fabricate a viscoelastic scaffold with tunable biomimetic mechanics for whole spine motion segment applications. We optimized the mechanical properties of the scaffolds for equilibrium and dynamic moduli in compression and tension by varying fiber spacing or porosity, generating scaffolds with de novo mechanical properties within the physiological range of spine motion segments. The biodegradation analysis of the 3D printed scaffolds showed that FPLA exhibits lower degradation rate and thus has longer mechanical stability than standard PLA. FPLA scaffolds were biocompatible, supporting viability of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in 2D and in FPLA+hydrogel composites. Composite scaffolds cultured with NP cells maintained baseline physiological mechanical properties and promoted matrix deposition up to 8 weeks in culture. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) cultured on FPLA adhered to the scaffold and exhibited fibrocartilaginous differentiation.

A wide range of therapeutics including anti-catabolic, pro-anabolic factors and chemo-attractants that can stimulate resident cells and recruit endogenous progenitors are under consideration. The avascular nature and the dense matrix of this tissue make it challenging for systemically administered drugs to reach their target cells inside the nucleus pulposus (NP), the central gelatinous region of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Therefore, local intra-discal injection of therapeutic drugs directly into the NP is a clinically relevant delivery approach, however, suffers from rapid and wide diffusion outside the injection site resulting in short lived benefits while causing systemic toxicity. NP has a high negative fixed charge density due to the presence of negatively charged aggrecan glycosaminoglycans that provide swelling pressures, compressive stiffness and hydration to the tissue. This negative fixed charge density can also be used for enhancing intra-NP residence time of therapeutic drugs. Here we design positively charged Avidin grafted branched Dextran nanostructures that utilize long-range binding effects of electrostatic interactions to bind with the intra-NP negatively charged groups. The binding is strong enough to enable a month-long retention of cationic nanostructures within the NP following intra-discal administration, yet weak and reversible to allow movement to reach cells dispersed throughout the tissue.

Methods It was a retrospective study of 94 consecutive patients undergoing transforaminal injection for lumbosacral radicular pain.

First injection non-responders were given a second injection with particulate steroid and again completed the survey. Results Approximately one-third (N = 31/94) of patients received no meaningful relief from a single injection with dexamethasone.

Cells of the IVD, nucleus pulposus (NP) and anulus fibrosus (AF), will exhibit various responses to different mechanical stimuli which appear to be highly dependent on loading type, magnitude, duration, and anatomic zone of cell origin. Cells of the NP, the innermost region of the disc, exhibit an anabolic response to low-moderate magnitudes of static compression, osmotic pressure, or hydrostatic pressure, while higher magnitudes promote a catabolic response marked by increased protease expression and activity. Cells of the outer AF are responsive to physical forces in a manner that depends on frequency and magnitude, as are cells of the NP, though they experience different forces, deformations, pressure, and osmotic pressure in vivo. Much remains to be understood of the mechanotransduction pathways that regulate IVD cell responses to loading, including responses to specific stimuli and also differences among cell types. There is evidence that cytoskeletal remodeling and receptor-mediated signaling are important mechanotransduction events that can regulate downstream effects like gene expression and posttranslational biosynthesis, all of which may influence phenotype and bioactivity. These and other mechanotransduction events will be regulated by known and to-be-discovered cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, and depend on composition of extracellular matrix ligands for cell interaction, matrix stiffness, and the phenotype of the cells themselves.

Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that contribute to inflammation and trigger DD have not been well characterized. Extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein has been implicated as a potent DAMP and pro-inflammatory stimulus in the immune system. In this study, we show that HMGB1 and IL-6 levels increase in patients with advanced DD in comparison to early DD. This study further tested the hypothesis that HMGB1 promotes inflammatory signaling driving DD in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and tissue. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of HMGB1 and its extracellular release by NP cells under cell stress. Gene expression and protein quantification indicate that HMGB1 stimulates the expression IL-6 and MMP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The contributions of toll-like receptor (TLR) -2, -4 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as receptors mediating HMGB1 signaling was examined using small molecule inhibitors. Inhibition of TLR-4 signaling, with TAK-242, completely abrogated HMGB1 induced IL-6 and MMP-1 expression, whereas inhibition of TLR-2, with O-vanillin, or RAGE, with FPS-ZM1, had mild inhibitory effects. HMGB1 stimulation activated NF-\u0138B signaling while TAK-242 co-treatment abrogated it. Lastly, effects of HMGB1 on matrix deposition was evaluated in a 3D culture system of human NP cells. These results implicate HMGB1 as a potent DAMP that promotes inflammation in NP cells and degradation of NP tissues.

LBP is the leading cause of disability, caused by various spine-related disorders, including intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and facet arthritis. The focus of these studies is inflammatory mediators, because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and associated pain mechanisms. Increasingly, studies suggest that the presence of inflammatory mediators can be measured systemically in the blood. These biomarkers may serve as novel tools for directing patient care. Currently, patient response to treatment is unpredictable with a significant rate of recurrence, and, while surgical treatments may provide anatomical correction and pain relief, they are invasive and costly. The review covers studies performed on populations with specific diagnoses and undefined origins of LBP. Since the natural history of LBP is progressive, the temporal nature of studies is categorized by duration of symptomology/disease. Related studies on changes in biomarkers with treatment are also reviewed.

Study 1: seeding density (1 M/mL versus 4 M/mL) was evaluated in unloaded and loaded (0.1\u2009MPa, 0.1 Hz) conditions. Study 2: loading magnitude (0, 0.1, and 0.6 MPa) applied at 0.1\u2009Hz to 1 M/mL for 7 days was evaluated. Study 1: 4 M/mL cell density had significantly lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen content, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). HP loading significantly increased ATP levels, and expression of aggrecan, collagen I, keratin-19, and N-cadherin in HP loaded versus unloaded groups. Study 2: aggrecan expression increased in a dose dependent manner with HP magnitude, whereas N-cadherin and keratin-19 expression were greatest in low HP loading compared to unloaded. Overall, the findings of the current study indicate that cell seeding density within a 3D construct is a critical variable influencing the mechanobiological response of NP cells to HP loading. NP mechanobiology and phenotypic expression was also found to be dependent on the magnitude of HP loading.

This study used a rat disc stab injury model with administration of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) at 3, 14, or 30 days post injury (DPI) to evaluate the impact of interventional timing on IVD biochemistry and biomechanics. We also evaluated cellular localization within the disc with near infrared imaging to track the time and spatial profile of cellular migration after in vivo delivery. Results showed that upon injection into a healthy disc, MSCs began to gradually migrate outwards over the course of 14 days, as indicated by decreased signal intensity from the disc space and increased signal within the adjacent vertebrae. Cells administered 14 or 30\u2009DPI also tended to migrate out 14 days after injection but cells injected 3\u2009DPI were retained at a significantly higher amount versus the other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Correspondingly the 3\u2009DPI group, but not 14 or 30\u2009DPI groups, had a higher GAG content in the MSC injected discs (p\u2009=\u20090.06). Enrichment of MSCs and increased GAG content in 3\u2009DPI group did not lead to increased compressive biomechanical properties. Findings suggest that cell therapies administered at an early stage of injury/disease progression may have greater chances of mitigating matrix loss, possibly through promotion of MSC activity by the inflammatory microenvironment associated with injury.

Biomarkers serve as objective molecular indicators of pathological processes. The goal of this study is to identify systemic biochemical factors as predictors of response to treatment of LBP with epidural steroid injection (ESI). Since inflammation plays a pivotal role in LBP, this pilot study investigates the effect of ESI on systemic levels of 48 inflammatory biochemical factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and examines the relationship between biochemical factor levels and pain or disability in patients with disc herniation (DH), or other diagnoses (Other Dx) leading to low back pain, which included spinal stenosis (SS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD). Study participants (n = 16) were recruited from a back pain management practice. Pain numerical rating score (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and blood samples were collected pre- and at 7 to 10 days post-treatment. Blood samples were assayed for inflammatory mediators using commercial multiplex assays. Mediator levels were compared pre- and post-treatment to investigate the potential correlations between clinical and biochemical outcomes. Our results indicate that a single ESI significantly decreased systemic levels of SCGF-\u03b2 and IL-2. Improvement in pain in all subjects was correlated with changes in chemokines (MCP-1, MIG), hematopoietic progenitor factors (SCGF-\u03b2), and factors that participate in angiogenesis/fibrosis (HGF), nociception (SCF, IFN-\u03b12), and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TRAIL). Levels of biochemical mediators varied based on diagnosis of LBP, and changes in pain responses and systemic mediators from pre- to post-treatment were dependent on the diagnosis cohort. In the DH cohort, levels of IL-17 and VEGF significantly decreased post-treatment. In the Other Dx cohort, levels of IL-2R\u03b1, IL-3, and SCGF-\u03b2 significantly decreased post-treatment. In order to determine whether mediator changes were related to pain, correlations between change in pain scores and change in mediator levels were performed. Subjects with DH demonstrated a profile signature that implicated hematopoiesis factors (SCGF-\u03b2, GM-CSF) in pain response, while subjects with Other Dx demonstrated a biomarker profile that implicated chemokines (MCP-1, MIG) and angiogenic factors (HGF, VEGF) in pain response. Our findings provide evidence that systemic biochemical factors in patients with LBP vary by diagnosis, and pain response to treatment is associated with a unique profile of biochemical responses in each diagnosis group.

Currently, clinical treatment outcomes are not strongly correlated with diagnoses, emphasizing the importance for characterizing more completely the mechanisms of degeneration and their relationships with symptoms. This review covers recent studies elucidating cellular and molecular changes associated with disc mechanobiology, as it relates to degeneration and regeneration. Specifically, we review findings on the biochemical changes in disc diseases, including cytokines, chemokines, and proteases; advancements in disc disease diagnostics using imaging modalities; updates on studies examining the response of the intervertebral disc to injury; and recent developments in repair strategies, including cell-based repair, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. Findings on the effects of the omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid, on nucleus pulposus tissue engineering are presented. Studies described in this review provide greater insights into the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and may define new paradigms for early or differential diagnostics of degeneration using new techniques such as systemic biomarkers. In addition, research on the mechanobiology of disease enriches the development of therapeutics for disc repair, with potential to diminish pain and disability associated with disc degeneration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathryn T", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "Biomechanics and Bioengineering Lab, Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy D", "Last Name": "Jacobsen", "Affiliation": "Biomechanics and Bioengineering Lab, Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Maidhof", "Affiliation": "Biomechanics and Bioengineering Lab, Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Virojanapa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Overby", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ona", "Last Name": "Bloom", "Affiliation": "Biomechanics and Bioengineering Lab, Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shaheda", "Last Name": "Quraishi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nadeen O", "Last Name": "Chahine", "Affiliation": "Biomechanics and Bioengineering Lab, Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA. nchahine@nshs.edu."}], "Journal": "Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine", "PubDate": "2015Mar"}, {"PMID": "24936787", "Title": "Inflammation induces irreversible biophysical changes in isolated nucleus pulposus cells.", "Abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration is accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines that have been implicated in disease etiology and matrix degradation. While the effects of inflammatory stimulation on disc cell metabolism have been well-studied, their effects on cell biophysical properties have not been investigated. The hypothesis of this study is that inflammatory stimulation alters the biomechanical properties of isolated disc cells and volume responses to step osmotic loading. Cells from the nucleus pulposus (NP) of bovine discs were isolated and treated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory ligand, or with the recombinant cytokine TNF-\u03b1 for 24 hours. We measured cellular volume regulation responses to osmotic loading either immediately after stimulation or after a 1 week recovery period from the inflammatory stimuli. Cells from each group were tested under step osmotic loading and the transient volume-response was captured via time-lapse microscopy. Volume-responses were analyzed using mixture theory framework to investigate two biomechanical properties of the cell, the intracellular water content and the hydraulic permeability. Intracellular water content did not vary between treatment groups, but hydraulic permeability increased significantly with inflammatory treatment. In the 1 week recovery group, hydraulic permeability remained elevated relative to the untreated recovery control. Cell radius was also significantly increased both after 24 hours of treatment and after 1 week recovery. A significant linear correlation was observed between hydraulic permeability and cell radius in untreated cells at 24 hours and at 1-week recovery, though not in the inflammatory stimulated groups at either time point. This loss of correlation between cell size and hydraulic permeability suggests that regulation of volume change is disrupted irreversibly due to inflammatory stimulation. Inflammatory treated cells exhibited altered F-actin cytoskeleton expression relative to untreated cells. We also found a significant decrease in the expression of aquaporin-1, the predominant water channel in disc NP cells, with inflammatory stimulation. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence that inflammatory stimulation directly alters the mechanobiology of NP cells. The cellular biophysical changes observed in this study are coincident with documented changes in the extracellular matrix induced by inflammation, and may be important in disease etiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aquaporin 1", "Cattle", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cell Size", "Cells, Cultured", "Connective Tissue Cells", "Cytoskeleton", "Inflammation", "Intervertebral Disc", "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Osmotic Pressure", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Maidhof", "Affiliation": "Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Jacobsen", "Affiliation": "Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Angelos", "Last Name": "Papatheodorou", "Affiliation": "Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nadeen O", "Last Name": "Chahine", "Affiliation": "Center for Autoimmune and Musculoskeletal Diseases, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America; Hofstra-North Shore LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24593020", "Title": "Nanocomposite scaffold for chondrocyte growth and cartilage tissue engineering: effects of carbon nanotube surface functionalization.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess the long-term biocompatibility of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for tissue engineering of articular cartilage. We hypothesized that SWNT nanocomposite scaffolds in cartilage tissue engineering can provide an improved molecular-sized substrate for stimulation of chondrocyte growth, as well as structural reinforcement of the scaffold's mechanical properties. The effect of SWNT surface functionalization (-COOH or -PEG) on chondrocyte viability and biochemical matrix deposition was examined in two-dimensional cultures, in three-dimensional (3D) pellet cultures, and in a 3D nanocomposite scaffold consisting of hydrogels+SWNTs. Outcome measures included cell viability, histological and SEM evaluation, GAG biochemical content, compressive and tensile biomechanical properties, and gene expression quantification, including extracellular matrix (ECM) markers aggrecan (Agc), collagen-1 (Col1a1), collagen-2 (Col2a1), collagen-10 (Col10a1), surface adhesion proteins fibronectin (Fn), CD44 antigen (CD44), and tumor marker (Tp53). Our findings indicate that chondrocytes tolerate functionalized SWNTs well, with minimal toxicity of cells in 3D culture systems (pellet and nanocomposite constructs). Both SWNT-PEG and SWNT-COOH groups increased the GAG content in nanocomposites relative to control. The compressive biomechanical properties of cell-laden SWNT-COOH nanocomposites were significantly elevated relative to control. Increases in the tensile modulus and ultimate stress were observed, indicative of a tensile reinforcement of the nanocomposite scaffolds. Surface coating of SWNTs with -COOH also resulted in increased Col2a1 and Fn gene expression throughout the culture in nanocomposite constructs, indicative of increased chondrocyte metabolic activity. In contrast, surface coating of SWNTs with a neutral -PEG moiety had no significant effect on Col2a1 or Fn gene expression, suggesting that the charged nature of the -COOH surface functionalization may promote ECM expression in this culture system.

Doxy adiministration at clinically relevant serum concentrations was found to significantly inhibit MMP activity after continuous treatment for 4 weeks, but not for continuous administration for shorter durations (96\u2009h or 2 weeks). Extended doxy administration was also associated with improved collagen fibril organization, and enhanced biomechanical properties (stiffness, ultimate tensile strength, maximum load to failure, and elastic toughness).

The first flurry of reports documented the use of various cell types ultimately leading to the first successful demonstration of autologous chondrocyte transplantation which was later translated to clinical use and has resulted in the revised axiom that cartilage regeneration is possible. The current field of cartilage repair is multifaceted and some of the 1980s' vintage concepts have been revisited with state of the art technology now available.

Here, we systematically evaluated the effect of age and cytoskeletal disruptors on the mechanical properties of chondrocytes as a function of deformation. We quantified the indentation-dependent mechanical properties of chondrocytes isolated from neonatal (1-day), adult (5-year) and geriatric (12-year) bovine knees using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We also measured the contribution of the actin and intermediate filaments to the indentation-dependent mechanical properties of chondrocytes. By integrating AFM with confocal fluorescent microscopy, we monitored cytoskeletal and biomechanical deformation in transgenic cells (GFP-vimentin and mCherry-actin) under compression. We found that the elastic modulus of chondrocytes in all age groups decreased with increased indentation (15-2000 nm). The elastic modulus of adult chondrocytes was significantly greater than neonatal cells at indentations greater than 500 nm. Viscoelastic moduli (instantaneous and equilibrium) were comparable in all age groups examined; however, the intrinsic viscosity was lower in geriatric chondrocytes than neonatal. Disrupting the actin or the intermediate filament structures altered the mechanical properties of chondrocytes by decreasing the elastic modulus and viscoelastic properties, resulting in a dramatic loss of indentation-dependent response with treatment. Actin and vimentin cytoskeletal structures were monitored using confocal fluorescent microscopy in transgenic cells treated with disruptors, and both treatments had a profound disruptive effect on the actin filaments. Here we show that disrupting the structure of intermediate filaments indirectly altered the configuration of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings underscore the importance of the cytoskeletal elements in the overall mechanical response of chondrocytes, indicating that intermediate filament integrity is key to the non-linear elastic properties of chondrocytes.
