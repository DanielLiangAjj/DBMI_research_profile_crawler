Loss of silencing of the repeat elements leads to genome instability and human diseases, including cancer and ageing1-3. Although the role of H3K9me3 in the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin silencing has been extensively studied4-6, the pattern and mechanism that underlie the partitioning of parental H3K9me3 at replicating DNA strands are unknown. Here we report that H3K9me3 is preferentially transferred onto the leading strands of replication forks, which occurs predominantly at long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retrotransposons (also known as LINE-1s or L1s) that are theoretically transcribed in the head-on direction with replication fork movement. Mechanistically, the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex interacts with the leading-strand DNA polymerase Pol\u2009\u03b5 and contributes to the asymmetric segregation of H3K9me3. Cells deficient in Pol\u2009\u03b5 subunits (POLE3 and POLE4) or the HUSH complex (MPP8 and TASOR) show compromised H3K9me3 asymmetry and increased LINE expression. Similar results were obtained in cells expressing a MPP8 mutant defective in H3K9me3 binding and in TASOR mutants with reduced interactions with Pol\u2009\u03b5.

As an RNA virus characterized by high mutation rates, whether SARS-CoV-2 will develop resistance to nirmatrelvir is a question of concern. Our previous studies have shown that several mutational pathways confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, but some result in a loss of viral replicative fitness, which is then compensated\u00a0for by additional alterations3. The molecular mechanisms for this observed resistance are\u00a0unknown. Here we combined biochemical and structural methods to demonstrate that alterations at the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro can allow SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance to nirmatrelvir in two distinct ways. Comprehensive studies of the\u00a0structures of\u00a014 Mpro mutants\u00a0in complex with drugs or substrate revealed that alterations at the S1 and S4 subsites substantially decreased\u00a0the level of inhibitor binding, whereas alterations at the S2 and S4' subsites unexpectedly increased protease activity. Both mechanisms contributed to nirmatrelvir resistance, with\u00a0the latter compensating for the loss in enzymatic activity of the former, which in turn accounted for the restoration of viral replicative fitness, as observed previously3. Such a profile was also observed for ensitrelvir, another clinically relevant Mpro inhibitor. These results shed light on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evolves to develop resistance to the current generation of protease inhibitors and provide the basis for the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antiviral Agents", "COVID-19", "Lactams", "Leucine", "Nitriles", "SARS-CoV-2", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Binding Sites", "Mutation",

1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 uses human tRNALys3 as the primer for reverse transcription, and the assembly of HIV-1 structural protein Gag at the plasma membrane (PM) is regulated by matrix (MA) domain-tRNA interactions. A large, dynamic multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) exists in the cytosol and consists of eight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) and three other cellular proteins. Proteomic studies to identify HIV-host interactions have identified the MSC as part of the HIV-1 Gag and MA interactomes. Here, we confirmed that the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag forms a stable complex with the MSC, mapped the primary interaction site to the linker domain of bi-functional human glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), and showed that the MA-EPRS interaction was RNA dependent. MA mutations that significantly reduced the EPRS interaction reduced viral infectivity and mapped to MA residues that also interact with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate. Overexpression of EPRS or EPRS fragments did not affect susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, and knockdown of EPRS reduced both a control reporter gene and HIV-1 protein translation. EPRS knockdown resulted in decreased progeny virion production, but the decrease could not be attributed to selective effects on virus gene expression, and the specific infectivity of the virions remained unchanged. While the precise function of the Gag-EPRS interaction remains uncertain, we discuss possible effects of the interaction on either virus or host activities.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1 MA\u2013tRNA interactions", "HIV-dependency factors", "glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase", "human immunodeficiency virus type 1", "multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases", "Cytoplasm", "Cytosol", "HIV-1", "Proteomics", "Protein Subunits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danni", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Center for Retrovirus Research, Center for RNA Biology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yiping", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heidi L", "Last Name": "Schubert", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 841122, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karin", "Last Name": "Musier-Forsyth", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Center for Retrovirus Research, Center for RNA Biology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}], "Journal": "Viruses", "PubDate": "2023Feb08"}, {"PMID": "36700653", "Title": "Virology under the Microscope-a Call for Rational Discourse.", "Abstract": "Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few.

including mineral and energy homeostasis. However, the identity of stem cells maintaining these tissues throughout adulthood remains elusive. By conducting genetic lineage tracing and cell depletion experiments in newly generated knock-in Cre/CreERT2 lines, we show here that rare Prrx1-expressing cells act as stem cells for bone, white adipose tissue and dermis in adult mice, which are indispensable for the homeostasis and repair of these tissues. Single-cell profiling reveals the cycling and multipotent nature of Prrx1-expressing cells and the stemness of these cells is further validated by transplantation assays. Moreover, we identify the cell surface markers for Prrx1-expressing stem cells and show that the activities of these stem cells are regulated by Wnt signaling.

ZAP inhibits the replication of retroviruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV-1, as well as alphaviruses, filoviruses, and hepatitis B virus, and also the retrotransposition of LINE-1 and Alu retroelements. ZAP operates posttranscriptionally to reduce the levels of viral transcripts available for translation in the cytoplasm, although additional functions might be involved. Recent studies have shown that ZAP preferentially binds viral mRNAs containing clusters of CpG dinucleotides via its four CCCH-type zinc fingers. ZAP lacks enzymatic activity and utilizes other cellular proteins to suppress viral replication. Tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) and the nuclease KHNYN have been identified as ZAP cofactors. In this study, we identify Riplet, a protein known to play a central role in the activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), as a novel ZAP cofactor. Overexpression of Riplet acts to strongly augment ZAP's antiviral activity. Riplet is an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing three domains, an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal P/SPRY domain. We show that Riplet interacts with ZAP via its P/SPRY domain and that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Riplet is not required to stimulate ZAP-mediated virus inhibition. Moreover, we show that Riplet interacts with TRIM25, suggesting that both Riplet and TRIM25 may operate as a complex to augment ZAP activity. IMPORTANCE The ZAP is a potent restriction factor inhibiting replication of many RNA viruses by binding directly to viral RNAs and targeting them for degradation.

Here, we identified the histone chaperones CHAF1A and CHAF1B as essential factors for silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of multiple histone chaperones, we found that KD of CHAF1A or CHAF1B resulted in a pronounced increase in expression of incoming viral DNAs. The function of these two proteins in silencing was independent of their interaction partner RBBP4. Viral DNA levels accumulated to significantly higher levels in CHAF1A KD cells over controls, suggesting enhanced stabilization of actively transcribed DNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed no major changes in histone loading onto viral DNAs in the absence of CHAF1A, but levels of the H3K9 trimethylation silencing mark were reduced.

A dominant maturation switch that stabilizes the immature capsid (CA) lattice is located downstream of the CA protein in many retroviral Gags. The HIV-1 Gag protein contains a stretch of 5 amino acid residues termed the \"clasp motif,\" important for the organization of the hexameric subunits that provide stability to the overall immature HIV-1 shell. Sequence alignment of the CA C-terminal domains (CTDs) of HIV-1 and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) highlighted a spacer-like domain in M-PMV that may provide a comparable function.

The potential role of viral accessory proteins in histone loading onto retroviral DNAs has not been extensively investigated. The p12 protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) is a virion protein that is critical for tethering the incoming viral DNA to host chromatin in the early stages of infection. Infection by virions containing a mutant p12 (PM14) defective in chromatin tethering results in the formation of viral DNAs that do not accumulate in the nucleus. In this report, we show that viral DNAs of these mutants are not loaded with histones. Moreover, the DNA genomes delivered by mutant p12 show prolonged association with viral structural proteins nucleocapsid (NC) and capsid (CA). The histone-poor viral DNA genomes do not become associated with the host RNA polymerase II machinery. These findings provide insights into fundamental aspects of retroviral biology, indicating that tethering to host chromatin by p12 and retention in the nucleus are required to allow loading of histones onto the viral DNA. IMPORTANCE Incoming retroviral DNAs are rapidly loaded with nucleosomal histones upon entry into the nucleus and before integration into the host genome.

The IN protein has also been reported to play a role in a number of other processes throughout the retroviral life cycle such as reverse transcription, nuclear import and particle morphogenesis. Studies have shown that HIV-1 IN is subject to multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) including acetylation, phosphorylation and SUMOylation. However, the importance of these modifications during infection has been contentious. In this study we attempt to clarify the role of acetylation of HIV-1 IN during the retroviral life cycle. We show that conservative mutation of the known acetylated lysine residues has only a modest effect on reverse transcription and proviral integration efficiency in vivo. However, we observe a large defect in successful expression of proviral genes at early times after infection by an acetylation-deficient IN mutant that cannot be explained by delayed integration dynamics. We demonstrate that the difference between the expression of proviruses integrated by an acetylation mutant and WT IN is likely not due to altered integration site distribution but rather directly due to a lower rate of transcription. Further, the effect of the IN mutation on proviral gene expression is independent of the Tat protein or the LTR promoter. At early times after integration when the transcription defect is observed, the LTRs of proviruses integrated by the mutant IN have altered histone modifications as well as reduced IN protein occupancy. Over time as the transcription defect in the mutant virus diminishes, histone modifications on the WT and mutant proviral LTRs reach comparable levels. These results highlight an unexpected role for the IN protein in regulating proviral transcription at early times post-integration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Cell Line", "DNA, Viral", "HIV Integrase", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mutation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Proviruses", "Viral Transcription", "Virus Integration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shelby", "Last Name": "Winans", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32823517", "Title": "Silencing and Transcriptional Regulation of Endogenous Retroviruses: An Overview.", "Abstract": "Almost half of the human genome is made up of transposable elements (TEs), and about 8% consists of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).

Sumoylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors seem to contribute to proper localization of Trim28 to ERV sequences and promote Trim28 interaction with Setdb1. Additionally, DNA methylation as well as RNA-mediated targeting of TEs such as piRNA-based silencing play important roles in ERV regulation. Despite the involvement of ERV overexpression in several cancer types, autoimmune diseases, and viral pathologies, ERVs are now also appreciated for their potential positive role in evolution.

Our screen identified the DNA-binding protein NP220, the three proteins (MPP8, TASOR and PPHLN1) that comprise the HUSH complex-which silences proviruses in heterochromatin6 and retrotransposons7,8-the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, and other host factors that are required for silencing.

This process is mediated by cellular proteins that interact first with the reverse transcription complex and later with the preintegration complex (PIC), allowing it to reach and enter the nucleus. For simple retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), the identities of the cellular proteins involved in trafficking of the PIC in infection are unknown. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the MLV PIC, we developed a replication-competent MLV in which the integrase protein was tagged with a FLAG epitope. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we established that the microtubule motor dynein regulator DCTN2/p50/dynamitin interacts with the MLV preintegration complex early in infection, suggesting a direct interaction between the incoming viral particles and the dynein complex regulators. Further experiments showed that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of either DCTN2/p50/dynamitin or another dynein regulator, NudEL, profoundly reduced the efficiency of infection by ecotropic, but not amphotropic, MLV reporters. We propose that the cytoplasmic dynein regulators are a critical component of the host machinery needed for infection by the retroviruses entering the cell via the ecotropic envelope pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dyneins", "Genome, Viral", "Leukemia Virus, Murine", "Leukemia, Experimental", "Mice", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Retroviridae Infections", "Tumor Virus Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Valle-Tenney", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Opazo", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Cancino", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gloria", "Last Name": "Arriagada", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile gloria.arriagada@unab.cl."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2016Aug01"}, {"PMID": "26945863", "Title": "Restriction of HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors in adult primary marrow-derived and peripheral mobilized human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells occurs prior to viral DNA integration.", "Abstract": "Gene therapy is currently being attempted using a number of delivery vehicles including lentiviral-based vectors.

Through analysis of Steamer integration sites, mitochondrial DNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and polymorphic microsatellite alleles, we show that the genotypes of neoplastic cells do not match those of the host animal. Instead, neoplastic cells from dispersed locations in New York, Maine, and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, all have nearly identical genotypes that differ from those of the host. These results indicate that the cancer is spreading between animals in the marine environment as a clonal transmissible cell derived from a single original clam.

Many of the transcription factors in ES cells control both host and retroviral genes coordinately, such that retroviral expression patterns can serve as markers of ES cell pluripotency. This overlap is not coincidental; retrovirus-derived regulatory sequences are often used to control cellular genes important for pluripotency. These sequences specify the temporal control and perhaps \"noisy\" control of cellular genes that direct proper cell gene expression in primitive cells and their differentiating progeny.

Both differential expression and allele-specific expression have been studied for heterosis (hybrid vigor), where the hybrid has improved performance over the parents for one or more traits. The Allele Workbench software was developed for a heterosis study that evaluated allele-specific expression for a mouse F1 hybrid using libraries from multiple tissues with biological replicates. This software has been made into a distributable package, which includes a pipeline, a Java interface to build the database, and a Java interface for query and display of the results. The required input is a reference genome, annotation file, and one or more RNA-Seq libraries with optional replicates. It evaluates allelic imbalance at the SNP and transcript level and flags transcripts with significant opposite directional allele-specific expression. The Java interface allows the user to view data from libraries, replicates, genes, transcripts, exons, and variants, including queries on allele imbalance for selected libraries. To determine the impact of allele-specific SNPs on protein folding, variants are annotated with their effect (e.g., missense), and the parental protein sequences may be exported for protein folding analysis.

DNA methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L) is an epigenetic regulator expressed in prospermatogonia, growing oocytes, and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we demonstrate that DNMT3L enhances the interaction of repressive epigenetic modifiers, including histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), SET domain, bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), and tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28; also known as TIF1\u03b2 and KAP1) in ES cells and orchestrates retroviral silencing activity with TRIM28 through mechanisms including, but not limited to, de novo DNA methylation. Ectopic expression of DNMT3L in somatic cells causes methylation-independent retroviral silencing activity by recruitment of the TRIM28/HDAC1/SETDB1/DNMT3A/DNMT3L complex to newly integrated Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) proviral DNA. Concurrent with this recruitment, we also observed the accumulation of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1\u03b3), as well as reduced H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation at Mo-MuLV proviral sequences. Ectopic expression of DNMT3L in late-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) recruited cytoplasmically localized HDAC1 to the nucleus. The formation of this epigenetic modifying complex requires interaction of DNMT3L with DNMT3A as well as with histone H3. In fetal testes at embryonic day 17.5, endogenous DNMT3L also enhanced the binding among TRIM28, DNMT3A, SETDB1, and HDAC1. We propose that DNMT3L may be involved in initiating a cascade of repressive epigenetic modifications by assisting in the preparation of a chromatin context that further attracts DNMT3A-DNMT3L binding and installs longer-term DNA methylation marks at newly integrated retroviruses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "DNA Methyltransferase 3A", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Expression", "Gene Silencing", "Histone Deacetylase 1", "Histones", "Humans", "Leukemia, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Moloney murine leukemia virus", "Nuclear Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Repressor Proteins", "Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tzu-Hao", "Last Name": "Kao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Hung-Fu", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kang-Yu", "Last Name": "Tai", "Affiliation": "Genome and Systems Biology Degree Program, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Ching-Yu", "Last Name": "Chuang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Hsuan-Shu", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Hung-Chih", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Kenichiro", "Last Name": "Hata", "Affiliation": "Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaodong", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steen K T", "Last Name": "Ooi", "Affiliation": "UCL Cancer Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Timothy H", "Last Name": "Bestor", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shau-Ping", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan Research Centre for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Centre for Systems Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan shaupinglin@ntu.edu.tw."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2014Sep"}, {"PMID": "24742368", "Title": "Asynchronous transcriptional silencing of individual retroviral genomes in embryonic cells.", "Abstract": "Retroviral DNAs are profoundly silenced at the transcriptional level in embryonic cell types.

F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that Gag and L9 interact within the nucleolus, and the CA domain was the major site of interaction. In addition, the isolated NC domain of Gag localized to the nucleolus, suggesting that it contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). To determine whether L9 plays a role in virus assembly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown was performed. Although Gag expression was not reduced with L9 knockdown, virus production was significantly impaired. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that efficient MMTV particle assembly is dependent upon the interaction of Gag and L9 in the nucleoli of infected cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Nucleolus", "Epithelial Cells", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Gene Products, gag", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse", "Mice", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Protein Sorting Signals", "Protein Transport", "Ribosomal Proteins", "Two-Hybrid System Techniques", "Virus Assembly"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea R", "Last Name": "Beyer", "Affiliation": "Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darrin V", "Last Name": "Bann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Breanna", "Last Name": "Rice", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ingrid S", "Last Name": "Pultz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Kane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatyana V", "Last Name": "Golovkina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leslie J", "Last Name": "Parent", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
