"Abstract": "BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells used in multiple myeloma (MM) are rapidly becoming a mainstay in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (RR) disease, and CAR-T cell expansion post-infusion has been shown to inform depth and duration of response, but measuring this process remains investigational. This multicenter study describes the kinetics and prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in the first 15 days after CAR-T infusion in 156 relapsed MM patients treated with the BCMA-targeting agents cilta-cel and ide-cel. Patients with higher maximum ALC (ALCmax) had better depth of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DoR). Patients with ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL had a superior PFS (30.5 versus 6 months, p <0.001) compared to those \u22641.0x103/uL, while patients with ALCmax \u22640.5 x103/uL represent a high-risk group with early disease progression and short PFS (HR 3.4, 95 CI: 2 -5.8, P <0.001). In multivariate analysis, ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL and non-paraskeletal extramedullary disease were the only independent predictors of PFS and DoR after accounting for ISS staging, age, CAR-T product, high-risk cytogenetics and number of previous lines. Moreover, our flow cytometry data suggests that ALC is a surrogate for BCMA CAR-T expansion and can be used as an accessible prognostic marker. We report for the first time the association of ALC after BCMA CAR-T infusion with clinical outcomes and its utility in predicting response in RRMM patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mateo", "Last Name": "Mejia Saldarriaga", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Darren", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Unkenholz", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tarek H", "Last Name": "Mouhieddine", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juan Esteban", "Last Name": "Velez-Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Engles", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua Alexander", "Last Name": "Fein", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Monge", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cara A", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Pearse", "Affiliation": "Cornell University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Jayabalan", "Affiliation": "Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Christian A", "Last Name": "Gordillo", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hei Ton", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Yamshon", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Santiago", "Last Name": "Thibaud", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Giorgio Ga", "Last Name": "Inghirami", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adriana", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samir", "Last Name": "Parekh", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NEW YORK, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sundar", "Last Name": "Jagannath", "Affiliation": "Mt.

Further, PD-1H interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and plays a necessary role in supporting c-Src activation and sealing zone formation. The critical role of PD-1H in myeloma lytic bone lesions was confirmed using a Pd-1h-/- myeloma bone disease mouse model wherein myeloma cells injected into Pd-1h-/-Rag2-/- results in attenuated bone destruction.

It is overexpressed in many cancer types. Because eukaryotic translation initiator factor 4E (eIF4E) plays a critical role in protein translation in cancer cells in multiple myeloma (MM), we evaluated the effectiveness of combined inhibition of protein translation and nuclear export in MM. Selinexor, an inhibitor of nuclear protein export, dose-dependently decreased eIF4E, IKZF1, and c-MYC protein levels. Using a doxycycline-inducible-pLKO-Tet-On vector, knockdown of eIF4E significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effects of selinexor, sensitized resistant MM cells to selinexor, and increased apoptosis in MM cells. Immunofluorescent analysis of MM cells showed that the combined treatment increased the localization of residual eIF4E to the nucleus compared with selinexor-only treatment. The overexpression of eIF4E at least partially rescued the effects of selinexor in MM cells by reducing G1 cell cycle arrest and increasing the selinexor-IC50 10-fold. Moreover, the combination of selinexor with pharmacologic inhibitors of protein translation showed synergistic anti-MM effects. These results suggest a synergistic anti-MM effect of selinexor combined with eIF4E inhibitors in\u00a0vitro.

However, these treatments are not curative, and patients eventually relapse, necessitating decisions on the appropriate choice of treatment(s) for the next phase of the disease. Additionally, an important subset of MM patients will prove to be refractory to the majority of the available treatments, requiring selection of effective therapies from the remaining options. Immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and alkylating agents are the major classes of MM therapies, with several options in each class. Patients who are refractory to one agent in a class may be responsive to a related compound or to a drug from a different class. However, rules for selection of alternative treatments in these situations are somewhat empirical and later phase clinical trials to inform those choices are ongoing. To address these issues the NCI Multiple Myeloma Steering Committee formed a relapsed/refractory working group to review optimal treatment choices, timing, and sequencing and provide recommendations. Additional issues considered include the role of salvage autologous stem cell transplantation, risk stratification, targeted approaches for genetic subsets of MM, appropriate clinical trial endpoints, and promising investigational agents.

That the process is reversible was evidenced in an in\u00a0vivo experimental model in which fibril-reactive chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11-1F4 directly targeted human light-chain amyloid deposits and affected their removal via a phagocyte-mediated response. To determine the tolerability and potential amyloidolytic effect of this agent (now designated mAb CAEL-101), we conducted a phase 1a/b study involving 27 patients, most of whom had manifestations of organ involvement. This was an open-label study in which phase 1a patients received mAb CAEL-101 as a single intravenous infusion with escalating dose levels from 0.5 mg/m2 to 500 mg/m2 to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In phase 1b, the antibody was administered as a graded series of 4 weekly infusions. For both phases, there were no drug-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities among recipients, and the MTD was not reached.

Thorough risk classification is essential to select the best clinical strategy to optimize outcomes. The SKY92 molecular signature classifies patients as standard- or high-risk for progression. The PRospective Observational Multiple Myeloma Impact Study (PROMMIS; NCT02911571) measures impact of SKY92 on risk classification and treatment plan. Newly diagnosed MM patients had bone marrow aspirates analyzed for SKY92. Physicians completed a questionnaire for each patient capturing risk classification, hypothetical treatment plan, and physician confidence in the treatment plan, before and after unblinding SKY92. One hundred forty seven\u00a0MM patients were enrolled. Before unblinding SKY92, physicians regarded 74 (50%) patients as clinical standard-risk. After unblinding SKY92, 16 patients were re-assigned as high-risk by the physician, and for 15 of them treatment strategy was impacted, resulting in an escalated treatment plan. For the 73 (50%) clinical high-risk patients, SKY92 indicated 46 patients to be standard-risk; for 31 of these patients the treatment strategy was impacted consistent with a de-escalation of risk. Overall, SKY92 impacted treatment decisions in 37% of patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For clinical decision-making, physicians incorporated SKY92, and the final assigned clinical risk was in line with SKY92 for 89% of patients. Furthermore, SKY92 significantly increased the confidence of the physicians' treatment decisions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

After assessing the available literature and grading recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method, experts from the working group recommend zoledronic acid as the preferred bone-targeted agent for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, with or without multiple myeloma-related bone disease. Once patients achieve a very good partial response or better, after receiving monthly zoledronic acid for at least 12 months, the treating physician can consider decreasing the frequency of or discontinuing zoledronic acid treatment. Denosumab can also be considered for the treatment of multiple myeloma-related bone disease, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Denosumab might prolong progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have multiple myeloma-related bone disease and who are eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. Denosumab discontinuation is challenging due to the rebound effect. The Bone Working Group of the International Myeloma Working Group also found cement augmentation to be effective for painful vertebral compression fractures. Radiotherapy is recommended for uncontrolled pain, impeding or symptomatic spinal cord compression, or pathological fractures.

The majority of the NRAS, KRAS, and BRAF mutations occur in hotspots causing constitutive activation of the corresponding proteins. Thus, targeting RAS mutation in MM will increase therapeutic efficiency and potentially overcome drug resistance. We identified germinal center kinase (GCK) as a novel therapeutic target in MM with RAS mutation. GCK knockdown (KD) in MM cells demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that silencing of GCK induces MM cell growth inhibition, associated with blocked MKK4/7-JNK phosphorylation and impaired degradation of IKZF1/3, BCL-6, and c-MYC. These effects were rescued by overexpression of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-resistant GCK, thereby excluding the potential off-target effects of GCK KD. In contrast, overexpression of shRNA-resistant GCK kinase-dead mutant (K45A) inhibited MM cell proliferation and failed to rescue the effects of GCK KD on MM growth inhibition, indicating that GCK kinase activity is critical for regulating MM cell proliferation and survival. Importantly, the higher sensitivity to GCK KD in RASMut cells suggests that targeting GCK is effective in MM, which harbors RAS mutations. In accordance with the effects of GCK KD, the GCK inhibitor TL4-12 dose-dependently downregulated IKZF1 and BCL-6 and led to MM cell proliferation inhibition accompanied by induction of apoptosis. Here, our data identify GCK as a novel target in RASMut MM cells, providing a rationale to treat RAS mutations in MM. Furthermore, GCK inhibitors might represent an alternative therapy to overcome immunomodulatory drug resistance in MM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Silencing", "Genetic Therapy", "Germinal Center Kinases", "Humans", "Mice, SCID", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Multiple Myeloma", "Mutation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction", "ras Proteins", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shirong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Huihui", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Divaya", "Last Name": "Bhutani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Christophe", "Last Name": "Marcireau", "Affiliation": "Sanofi, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2021Apr01"}, {"PMID": "32966668", "Title": "Prognostic impact of t(11;14) in multiple myeloma: Black and white or shades of gray?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["cytogenetics", "multiple myeloma", "race", "t(11;14)", "venetoclax"], "MeSH terms": ["Bortezomib", "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic", "Humans", "Multiple Myeloma", "Prognosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rajshekhar", "Last Name": "Chakraborty", "Affiliation": "Multiple Myeloma and Amyloidosis Service, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Multiple Myeloma and Amyloidosis Service, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer", "PubDate": "2021Jan01"}, {"PMID": "32864761", "Title": "The clinical and pathological features of plasma cell myeloma post solid organ transplantation.", "Abstract": "Plasma cell neoplasms (PCNs), comprising plasma cell myelomas (PCMs) and plasmacytomas, which occur after solid organ transplantation, represent rare subtypes of monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (M-PTLDs).

Marrow plasma cell infiltration ranged from 10%-70% (median 20%), with 10/15 (67%) and 5/15 (33%) cases manifesting immature and plasmablastic morphology. The immunophenotype of all cases and cytogenetic abnormalities, identified in 60% of cases, were similar to multiple myeloma (MM) of immunocompetent individuals. All PT-PCMs were EBER negative. Ten of 11 (91%) patients with active MM were treated, all with proteasome inhibitor-based therapy. Treatment response and 5-year overall survival (54.5%) was comparable to MM of immunocompetent individuals. However, the survival of patients with plasmablastic PCMs was inferior to those with immature PCMs. 0ur findings indicate PT-PCMs to be predominantly late onset PTLDs that have similar clinicopathologic characteristics as conventional MM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Leukemia, Plasma Cell", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Transplantation", "Survival Rate"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Ofori", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Soderquist", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Vundavalli V", "Last Name": "Murty", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Vlad", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca J", "Last Name": "Leeman-Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Bachir", "Last Name": "Alobeid", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Govind", "Last Name": "Bhagat", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, US."}], "Journal": "American journal of hematology", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32819447", "Title": "Daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma: subgroup analysis of CASTOR based on cytogenetic risk.", "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) patients with high cytogenetic risk have poor outcomes.

This causes a direct toxic effect, eventually leading to organ failure. The underlying B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is almost always a clonal plasma cell disorder, most often a small plasma cell clone of <10%. Current therapy is directed toward elimination of the plasma cell clone with the goal of preventing further organ damage and reversal of the existing organ damage. Autologous stem cell transplantation has been shown to be a very effective treatment in patients with AL amyloidosis, although it cannot be widely applied as patients are often frail at presentation, making them ineligible for transplantation. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone has emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. Novel anti-plasma cell therapies, such as second generation proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies targeting a surface protein on the plasma cell (daratumumab, elotuzumab), and the small molecular inhibitor venetoclax, have continued to emerge and are being evaluated in combination with the standard of care. However, there is still a need for therapies that directly target the amyloid fibrils and reverse organ damage.

Since 2011, bisphosphonate use has been recommended by NCCN for all patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving antineoplastic therapy independent of the presence of bone disease. This study investigated their use after these guidelines were established. Methods: We identified patients aged \u226565 years in the SEER-Medicare database with newly diagnosed MM between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, who received antineoplastic therapy, had \u22656 months of follow-up, and did not receive prior bisphosphonates. Presence of SREs at diagnosis was identified, including pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery to bone. Use of bisphosphonates was defined as having \u22651 claim for an intravenous or oral bisphosphonate within 6 months after the start of antineoplastic therapy. We used multivariable modeling to compare users with nonusers, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. We compared overall survival between users and nonusers using proportional hazards analysis. Results: Of 1,309 patients identified, 720 (55%) used a bisphosphonate. Factors associated with use included SRE at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.60; 95% CI, 1.98-3.40), hypercalcemia (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26-2.41), and use of proteasome inhibitor + immunomodulatory imide therapy (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.39). Chronic kidney disease (AOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.66) was associated with decreased use. Bisphosphonate use was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88).

The primary objectives of this study were to determine the safety profile, overall response rate (ORR), and a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SVd. We enrolled 42 patients to receive selinexor (60, 80, or 100 mg orally) plus bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously) and dexamethasone (20 mg orally) once or twice weekly in 21- or 35-day cycles.

Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in \u226510% of patients were thrombocytopenia (45%), neutropenia (24%), fatigue (14%), and anemia (12%). Incidence (4 patients, 10%) and grade (\u22642) of peripheral neuropathy were low. The ORR for the entire population was 63%: 84% ORR for PI nonrefractory and 43% for PI-refractory patients. The median progression-free survival for all patients was 9.0 months; 17.8 months for PI nonrefractory, and 6.1 months for PI refractory.

expansion of hematopoietic progenitors with concomitant block of megakaryocytic maturation.", "Abstract": "The immunomodulatory drugs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide yield high response rates in multiple myeloma patients, but are associated with a high rate of thrombocytopenia and increased risk of secondary hematologic malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that the immunomodulatory drugs induce self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors and upregulate megakaryocytic colonies by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing proliferation of early megakaryocytic progenitors via down-regulation of IKZF1. In this process, the immunomodulatory drugs degrade IKZF1 and subsequently down-regulate its binding partner, GATA1. This results in the decrease of GATA1 targets such as ZFPM1 and NFE2, leading to expansion of megakaryocytic progenitors with concomitant inhibition of maturation of megakaryocytes.

The mechanism of action is unknown. Here we found that IMiD compounds cause selective ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor IKZF1 in CD34+ cells by the Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Loss of IKZF1 is associated with a decrease of the IKZF1-dependent transcription factor PU.1, critical for the development and maturation of neutrophils. Using a thalidomide analog bead pull-down assay, we showed that IMiD compounds directly bind CRBN in CD34+ cells. Knockdown of CRBN in CD34+ cells resulted in resistance to POM-induced IKZF1 downregulation and reversed the POM-induced lineage shift in colony-formation assays, suggesting that the POM-induced degradation of IKZF1 in CD34+ cells requires CRBN. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that IKZF1 binds to the promoter region of PU.1, suggesting that PU.1 is a direct downstream target of IKZF1 in CD34+ cells. POM failed to induce IKZF1 degradation in IKZF1-Q146H-OE CD34+ cells, indicating that CRBN binding to IKZF1 and subsequent IKZF1 ubiquitination is critical in this process. Using the NOD/SCID/\u03b3-c KO mouse model, we confirmed the induction of myeloid progenitor cells by IMiD compounds at the expense of common lymphoid progenitors. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of IMiD compounds in hematopoietic progenitor cells, leading to selective degradation of transcription factors critical for myeloid maturation, and explain the occurrence of neutropenia associated with treatment by IMiD compounds.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Antigens, CD34", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Ikaros Transcription Factor", "Immunologic Factors", "Mice", "Myeloid Progenitor Cells", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neutropenia", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Ubiquitination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shirong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Humanized Mouse Core Facility, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Huihui", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoming", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yong-Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Humanized Mouse Core Facility, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Shixian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and."}], "Journal": "Blood advances", "PubDate": "2018Mar13"}, {"PMID": "29390929", "Title": "Use and impact of herpes zoster prophylaxis in myeloma patients treated with proteasome inhibitors.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "Antiviral Agents", "Female", "Herpes Zoster", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Myeloma", "Proteasome Inhibitors", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Siyang", "Last Name": "Leng", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanhan", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "c Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Yann", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "c Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason Dennis", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "b Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawn Lauryn", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Alfred I", "Last Name": "Neugut", "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY , USA."}], "Journal": "Leukemia & lymphoma", "PubDate": "2018Oct"}, {"PMID": "28637662", "Title": "Daratumumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.", "Abstract": "Daratumumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) was evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with \u22652 prior lines of therapy who were refractory to their last treatment.

Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K \u03b4 isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 \u03b5 (CK1\u03b5). Targeting CK1\u03b5 using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3K\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib.

Response criteria in multiple myeloma were developed to use serum and urine assessment of monoclonal proteins and bone marrow assessment (which is relatively insensitive). Given the high rates of complete response seen in patients with multiple myeloma with new treatment approaches, new response categories need to be defined that can identify responses that are deeper than those conventionally defined as complete response. Recent attempts have focused on the identification of residual tumour cells in the bone marrow using flow cytometry or gene sequencing. Furthermore, sensitive imaging techniques can be used to detect the presence of residual disease outside of the bone marrow. Combining these new methods, the International Myeloma Working Group has defined new response categories of minimal residual disease negativity, with or without imaging-based absence of extramedullary disease, to allow uniform reporting within and outside clinical trials.

Here, we performed a screen of human myeloma cells to identify pro-osteoclastogenic agents that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for ameliorating MM-associated bone disease. We found that myeloma cells express high levels of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 and determined that MMP-13 directly enhances osteoclast multinucleation and bone-resorptive activity by triggering upregulation of the cell fusogen DC-STAMP. Moreover, this effect was independent of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Further, in mouse xenograft models, silencing MMP-13 expression in myeloma cells inhibited the development of osteolytic lesions. In patient cohorts, MMP-13 expression was localized to BM-associated myeloma cells, while elevated MMP-13 serum levels were able to correctly predict the presence of active bone disease.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for survival. The median time from MM diagnosis to CNS MM diagnosis was 3 years. Thirty-eight patients (22%) were diagnosed with CNS involvement at the time of initial MM diagnosis and 134 (78%) at relapse/progression. Upon diagnosis of CNS MM, 97% patients received initial therapy for CNS disease, of which 76% received systemic therapy, 36% radiotherapy and 32% intrathecal therapy. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the median overall survival (OS) from the onset of CNS involvement for the entire group was 7 months. Untreated and treated patients had median OS of 2 and 8 months, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). At least one previous line of therapy for MM before the diagnosis of CNS disease and >1 cytogenetic abnormality detected by FISH were independently associated with worse OS. The median OS for patients with 0, 1 and 2 of these risk factors were 25 months, 5.5 months and 2 months, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Neurological manifestations, not considered chemotherapy-related, observed at any time after initial diagnosis of MM should raise a suspicion of CNS involvement. Although prognosis is generally poor, the survival of previously untreated patients and patients with favorable cytogenetic profile might be prolonged due to systemic treatment and/or radiotherapy.

The oncogenic potential of tumorigenesis, which is highly contingent on cap-dependent eIF4E, also arises from the critical role in the nuclear export and cytosolic translation of oncogenic transcripts. Inhibition of Exportin1 (XPO1), which is the major nuclear export protein for eIF4E-bound oncoprotein mRNAs, results in decreased tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that eIF4E is critical in multiple myeloma. Indeed, we found that eIF4E is overexpressed in myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells compared with normal plasma cells. Although stable overexpression of eIF4E in multiple myeloma cells significantly increases tumorigenesis, knockdown of eIF4E impairs multiple myeloma tumor progression in a human xenograft mouse model. Using a tet-on-inducible eIF4E-knockdown system, eIF4E downregulation blocks multiple myeloma tumor growth in vivo, correlating with decreased eIF4E expression. Further overexpression and knockdown of eIF4E revealed that eIF4E regulates translation of mRNAs with highly complex 5'-untranslated regions, such as c-MYC and C/EBP\u03b2, and subsequently proliferation in multiple myeloma cells, but not in nonmalignant bone marrow stromal cells. Because many transcription factors that are critical for multiple myeloma proliferation exhibit a higher dependency on protein translation, eIF4E is an ideal and selective tool to target multiple myeloma cell growth.

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the regimen. A total of 32 patients were enrolled. The MTD of the regimen was dose level 1 (carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m(2), pomalidomide 4 mg, dexamethasone 40 mg).

Cannabinergic ligands with CB2 selectivity emerge as a class of promising agents to treat CB2-expressing malignancies without psychotropic concerns. In this study, we found that CB2 but not CB1 was highly expressed in human multiple myeloma (MM) and primary CD138+ cells. A novel inverse agonist of CB2, phenylacetylamide but not CB1 inverse agonist SR141716, inhibited the proliferation of human MM cells (IC50 : 0.62 \u223c 2.5 \u03bcM) mediated by apoptosis induction, but exhibited minor cytotoxic effects on human normal mononuclear cells. CB2 gene silencing or pharmacological antagonism markedly attenuated phenylacetylamide's anti-MM effects. Phenylacetylamide triggered the expression of C/EBP homologous protein at the early treatment stage, followed by death receptor-5 upregulation, caspase activation, and \u03b2-actin/tubulin degradation. Cell cycle related protein cdc25C and mitotic regulator Aurora A kinase were inactivated by phenylacetylamide treatment, leading to an increase in the ratio inactive/active cdc2 kinase. As a result, phosphorylation of CDK substrates was decreased, and the MM cell mitotic division was largely blocked by treatment. Importantly, phenylacetylamide could overcome the chemoresistance of MM cells against dexamethasone or melphalan. Thus, targeting CB2 may represent an attractive approach to treat cancers of immune origin.", "Keywords": ["apoptosis", "cannabinoid receptor-2", "cell cycle", "cytoskeleton", "multiple myeloma"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Apoptosis", "CDC2 Protein Kinase", "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists", "Caspases", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytoskeleton", "Gene Silencing", "Humans", "Mitosis", "Multiple Myeloma", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2", "Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Syndecan-1", "Tubulin", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rentian", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Qin", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Zhaojun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Haizi", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Lirong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University, New York."}, {"First Name": "G David", "Last Name": "Roodman", "Affiliation": "Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana."}, {"First Name": "Xiang-Qun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Institute, Computational Chemical Genomics Screening Center, School of Pharmacy, and NIH NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "Molecular carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}, {"PMID": "25605835", "Title": "Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the management of patients with multiple myeloma: a consensus statement.", "Abstract": "The aim of International Myeloma Working Group was to develop practical recommendations for the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in multiple myeloma (MM).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multiple Myeloma", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meletios A", "Last Name": "Dimopoulos", "Affiliation": "Meletios A.

Conventional radiography, despite decades of use, is often insufficient for detection of bone disease in multiple myeloma. Modern imaging techniques such as MRI, PET, and CT offer superior detection of myeloma bone disease and extramedullary manifestations of plasma cell dyscrasias. Novel whole-body low-dose computed tomography (WBLDCT) protocols allow for collection of superior image detail of the skeleton at doses of radiation similar to those used for conventional planar radiography. Several studies have shown that WBLDCT has a superior detection rate for lytic bone lesions compared with whole-body X-ray (WBXR), potentially leading to restaging and changes in therapy. MRI and PET provide imaging data important for assessing disease activity and prognostication. Because of several advantages over WBXR, WBLDCT is already the standard imaging technique for use in patients with multiple myeloma in many European institutions. However, the radiographic skeletal survey or WBXR is still the initial study of choice used to screen for myeloma bone disease in many institutions.
