Whereas young neurons are capable of buffering disease-causing stresses, mature neurons lose this ability and degenerate over time. We hypothesized that the resilience of young motor neurons could be restored by re-expression of the embryonic motor neuron selector transcription factors ISL1 and LHX3. We found that viral re-expression of ISL1 and LHX3 reactivates aspects of the youthful gene expression program in mature motor neurons and alleviates key disease-relevant phenotypes in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. Our results suggest that redeployment of lineage-specific neuronal selector transcription factors can be an effective strategy to attenuate age-dependent phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily R", "Last Name": "Lowry", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tulsi", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathon A", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shahroz", "Last Name": "Tariq", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hranush", "Last Name": "Melikyan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siaresh", "Last Name": "Aziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Georgia", "Last Name": "Dermentzaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Lotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hynek", "Last Name": "Wichterle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr05"}, {"PMID": "37862432", "Title": "Long 3'UTRs predispose neurons to inflammation by promoting immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA formation.", "Abstract": "Loss of RNA homeostasis underlies numerous neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger neuroinflammation are poorly understood. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers innate immune responses when sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in all cell types. Here, we report that human neurons intrinsically carry exceptionally high levels of immunostimulatory dsRNAs and identify long 3'UTRs as giving rise to neuronal dsRNA structures. We found that the neuron-enriched ELAVL family of genes (ELAVL2, ELAVL3, and ELAVL4) can increase (i) 3'UTR length, (ii) dsRNA load, and (iii) activation of dsRNA-sensing PRRs such as MDA5, PKR, and TLR3. In wild-type neurons, neuronal dsRNAs signaled through PRRs to induce tonic production of the antiviral type I interferon. Depleting ELAVL2 in WT neurons led to global shortening of 3'UTR length, reduced immunostimulatory dsRNA levels, and rendered WT neurons susceptible to herpes simplex virus and Zika virus infection. Neurons deficient in ADAR1, a dsRNA-editing enzyme mutated in the neuroinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, exhibited intolerably high levels of dsRNA that triggered PRR-mediated toxic inflammation and neuronal death. Depleting ELAVL2 in ADAR1 knockout neurons led to prolonged neuron survival by reducing immunostimulatory dsRNA levels. In summary, neurons are specialized cells where PRRs constantly sense \"self\" dsRNAs to preemptively induce protective antiviral immunity, but maintaining RNA homeostasis is paramount to prevent pathological neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "3' Untranslated Regions", "RNA, Double-Stranded", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Inflammation", "Receptors, Pattern Recognition", "Neurons", "Zika Virus", "Zika Virus Infection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tyler J", "Last Name": "Dorrity", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heegwon", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenenni A", "Last Name": "Wiegand", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Aruda", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Closser", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jake A", "Last Name": "Gertie", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Leone", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Polfer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Culbertson", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Takamasa", "Last Name": "Ito", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuefeng", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna-Lena", "Last Name": "Steckelberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hynek", "Last Name": "Wichterle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hachung", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Science immunology", "PubDate": "2023Oct27"}, {"PMID": "37364986", "Title": "Major \u03b2 cell-specific functions of NKX2.2 are mediated via the NK2-specific domain.", "Abstract": "The consolidation of unambiguous cell fate commitment relies on the ability of transcription factors (TFs) to exert tissue-specific regulation of complex genetic networks.

Here, we dissect the functional components of the imprinting control region of the essential Dlk1-Dio3 locus (called IG-DMR) in pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that the IG-DMR consists of two antagonistic elements: a paternally methylated CpG island that prevents recruitment of TET dioxygenases and a maternally unmethylated non-canonical enhancer that ensures expression of the Gtl2 lncRNA by counteracting de novo DNA methyltransferases. Genetic or epigenetic editing of these elements leads to distinct LOI phenotypes with characteristic alternations of allele-specific gene expression, DNA methylation, and 3D chromatin topology. Although repression of the Gtl2 promoter results in dysregulated imprinting, the stability of LOI phenotypes depends on the IG-DMR, suggesting a functional hierarchy.

Here, we studied HOX clock pacing in human pluripotent stem cell-derived axial progenitors differentiating into diverse spinal cord motor neuron subtypes. We show that the progressive activation of caudal HOX genes is controlled by a dynamic increase in FGF signaling. Blocking the FGF pathway stalled induction of HOX genes, while a precocious increase of FGF, alone or with GDF11 ligand, accelerated the HOX clock. Cells differentiated under accelerated HOX induction generated appropriate posterior motor neuron subtypes found along the human embryonic spinal cord.

Using a rapid and efficient protocol to differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) to SpMNs and CrMNs, we now report that ESC-derived CrMNs accumulate less human (h)SOD1 and insoluble p62 than SpMNs over time. ESC-derived CrMNs have higher proteasome activity to degrade misfolded proteins and are intrinsically more resistant to chemically-induced proteostatic stress than SpMNs. Chemical and genetic activation of the proteasome rescues SpMN sensitivity to proteostatic stress.

A small-molecule screen identified cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) as a stressor to which stem cell-derived motor neurons were more sensitive than interneurons. CPA induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, CPA resulted in an accelerated degeneration of motor neurons expressing human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) carrying the ALS-causing G93A mutation, compared to motor neurons expressing wild-type hSOD1. A secondary screen identified compounds that alleviated CPA-mediated motor neuron degeneration: three kinase inhibitors and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid derivative. The neuroprotective effects of these compounds were validated in human stem cell-derived motor neurons carrying a mutated SOD1 allele (hSOD1A4V). Moreover, we found that the administration of TUDCA in an hSOD1G93A mouse model of ALS reduced muscle denervation.

First, to increase motor neuron yield, we screened a small-molecule collection and found that the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 enhances motor neuron progenitor proliferation up to 4-fold in hESC and hiPSC cultures. Next, we FACS-purified motor neurons expressing the Hb9::GFP reporter from Y-27632-amplified embryoid bodies and cultured them in the presence of mitotic inhibitors to eliminate dividing progenitors. Survival of these purified motor neurons in the absence of any other cell type was strongly dependent on neurotrophic support. GDNF, BDNF and CNTF all showed potent survival effects (EC(50) 1-2 pM). The number of surviving motor neurons was further enhanced in the presence of forskolin and IBMX, agents that increase endogenous cAMP levels. As a demonstration of the ability of the assay to detect novel neurotrophic agents, Y-27632 itself was found to support human motor neuron survival.

To reliably characterize such condition-specific regulatory binding we introduce MultiGPS, an integrated machine learning approach for the analysis of multiple related ChIP-seq experiments. MultiGPS is based on a generalized Expectation Maximization framework that shares information across multiple experiments for binding event discovery. We demonstrate that our framework enables the simultaneous modeling of sparse condition-specific binding changes, sequence dependence, and replicate-specific noise sources. MultiGPS encourages consistency in reported binding event locations across multiple-condition ChIP-seq datasets and provides accurate estimation of ChIP enrichment levels at each event. MultiGPS's multi-experiment modeling approach thus provides a reliable platform for detecting differential binding enrichment across experimental conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of MultiGPS with an analysis of Cdx2 binding in three distinct developmental contexts. By accurately characterizing condition-specific Cdx2 binding, MultiGPS enables novel insight into the mechanistic basis of Cdx2 site selectivity. Specifically, the condition-specific Cdx2 sites characterized by MultiGPS are highly associated with pre-existing genomic context, suggesting that such sites are pre-determined by cell-specific regulatory architecture. However, MultiGPS-defined condition-independent sites are not predicted by pre-existing regulatory signals, suggesting that Cdx2 can bind to a subset of locations regardless of genomic environment.

Focusing on the motor neuron (MN) disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we therefore devised a fully humanized coculture model composed of human adult primary sporadic ALS (sALS) astrocytes and human embryonic stem-cell-derived MNs. The model reproduces the cardinal features of human ALS: sALS astrocytes, but not those from control patients, trigger selective death of MNs. The mechanisms underlying this non-cell-autonomous toxicity were investigated in both astrocytes and MNs. Although causal in familial ALS (fALS), SOD1 does not contribute to the toxicity of sALS astrocytes. Death of MNs triggered by either sALS or fALS astrocytes occurs through necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis involving receptor-interacting protein 1 and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein.

Here we demonstrate that Hox chromatin is subdivided into discrete domains that are controlled by rostrocaudal patterning signals that trigger rapid, domain-wide clearance of repressive histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) polycomb modifications. Treatment of differentiating mouse neural progenitors with retinoic acid leads to activation and binding of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to the Hox1-Hox5 chromatin domains, which is followed by a rapid domain-wide removal of H3K27me3 and acquisition of cervical spinal identity. Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals induce expression of the Cdx2 transcription factor that binds and clears H3K27me3 from the Hox1-Hox9 chromatin domains, leading to specification of brachial or thoracic spinal identity.

Three transcription factors, Ngn2, Isl1 and Lhx3, were sufficient to program rapidly and efficiently spinal motor neuron identity when expressed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. Replacement of Lhx3 by Phox2a led to specification of cranial, rather than spinal, motor neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis of Isl1, Lhx3 and Phox2a binding sites revealed that the two cell fates were programmed by the recruitment of Isl1-Lhx3 and Isl1-Phox2a complexes to distinct genomic locations characterized by a unique grammar of homeodomain binding motifs.

We report a combination of small molecules that within 3 weeks induce motor neurons at up to 50% abundance and with defined subtype identities of relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Despite their accelerated differentiation, motor neurons expressed combinations of HB9, ISL1, and column-specific markers that mirror those observed in vivo in human embryonic spinal cord. They also exhibited spontaneous and induced activity, and projected axons toward muscles when grafted into developing chick spinal cord. Strikingly, this novel protocol preferentially generates motor neurons expressing markers of limb-innervating lateral motor column motor neurons (FOXP1(+)/LHX3(-)).
