We previously showed that multivalent delivery of peptides as soluble antigen arrays (SAgAs) efficiently protects against spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Here, we compared the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of SAgAs versus free peptides. SAgAs, but not their corresponding free peptides at equivalent doses, efficiently prevented the development of diabetes. SAgAs increased the frequency of regulatory T cells among peptide-specific T cells or induce their anergy/exhaustion or deletion, depending on the type of SAgA used (hydrolysable (hSAgA) and non-hydrolysable 'click' SAgA (cSAgA)) and duration of treatment, whereas their corresponding free peptides induced a more effector phenotype following delayed clonal expansion. Over time, the peptides induced an IgE-independent anaphylactic reaction, the incidence of which was significantly delayed when peptides were in SAgA form rather than in free form. Moreover, the N-terminal modification of peptides with aminooxy or alkyne linkers, which was needed for grafting onto hyaluronic acid to make hSAgA or cSAgA variants, respectively, influenced their stimulatory potency and safety, with alkyne-functionalized peptides being more potent and less anaphylactogenic than aminooxy-functionalized peptides. Immunologic anaphylaxis occurred in NOD mice in a dose-dependent manner but not in C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice; however, its incidence did not correlate with the level of anti-peptide antibodies. We provide evidence that SAgAs significantly improve the efficacy of peptides to induce tolerance and prevent autoimmune diabetes while at the same time reducing their anaphylactogenic potential.", "Keywords": ["anaphylaxis", "autoimmune diabetes", "immunotherapy", "peptide delivery", "peptide modification", "soluble antigen array"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Immune Tolerance", "Peptides", "Female", "Autoantigens", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Immunotherapy", "Anaphylaxis", "Desensitization, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebuma", "Last Name": "Firdessa-Fite", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie N", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Camillo", "Last Name": "Bechi Genzano", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Leon", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Ku", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fernando A", "Last Name": "Ocampo Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua O", "Last Name": "Sestak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Berkland", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38286827", "Title": "Loss of Pip4k2c confers liver-metastatic organotropism through insulin-dependent PI3K-AKT pathway activation.", "Abstract": "Liver metastasis (LM) confers poor survival and therapy resistance across cancer types, but the mechanisms of liver-metastatic organotropism remain unknown.

The trained model distinguishes distinct interaction dynamics (in motility and morphology) between cognate and non-cognate T cells and DCs over 20 to 80\u00a0min. The model classified high affinity antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from OT-I mice with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91, and generalized well to other types of high and low affinity CD8+ T cells.

To our knowledge, these data provide the first demonstration of negative selection of human T cells recognizing a naturally-expressed tissue-restricted antigen.

Current therapies for T1D either treat symptoms or cause global immunosuppression, which leave patients at risk of developing long-term complications or vulnerable to foreign pathogens. Antigen-specific immunotherapies have emerged as a selective approach for autoimmune diseases by inducing tolerance while mitigating global immunosuppression. We previously reported SAgAs with multiple copies of a multiple sclerosis (MS) autoantigen grafted onto hyaluronic acid (HA) as an efficacious therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While the immune response of MS is distinct from that of T1D, the mechanism of SAgAs was hypothesized to be similar and via induction of immune tolerance to diabetes antigens. We synthesized SAgAs composed of HA polymer backbone conjugated with multiple copies of the T1D autoantigen mimotope p79 using aminooxy chemistry (SAgAp79) or using copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (cSAgAp79) chemistry. SAgAs constructed using the hydrolyzable aminooxy linkage, thus capable of releasing p79, exhibited physicochemical properties similar to the triazole linkage. Both SAgAp79 versions showed high specificity and efficacy in stimulating epitope-specific T cells. SAgAs can be taken up by most immune cell populations but do not induce their maturation, and conventional dendritic cells are responsible for the brunt of antigen presentation within splenocytes. cSAgAp79 was more stimulatory than SAgAp79 both in vitro and in vivo, an effect that was ascribed to the peptide modification rather than the type of linkage. In summary, we provide here the first proof-of-principle that SAgA therapy could also be applicable to T1D.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Cells, Cultured", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Epitopes", "Female", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, Transgenic", "Protein Array Analysis", "Spleen", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Leon", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Kansas , 1251 Wescoe Hall Drive , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Rebuma", "Last Name": "Firdessa-Fite", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center , Columbia University Medical Center , 650 West 168th Street , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Justin K", "Last Name": "Ruffalo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering , University of Kansas , 1530 West 15th Street , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Chad J", "Last Name": "Pickens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , University of Kansas , 2095 Constant Avenue , Lawrence , Kansas 66047 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua O", "Last Name": "Sestak", "Affiliation": "Orion BioScience Inc. , 986099 Nebraska Medical Center , Omaha , Nebraska 68198 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center , Columbia University Medical Center , 650 West 168th Street , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Berkland", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Kansas , 1251 Wescoe Hall Drive , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2019Jul19"}, {"PMID": "30899071", "Title": "Transgenic substitution with Greater Amberjack Seriola dumerili fish insulin 2 in NOD mice reduces beta cell immunogenicity.", "Abstract": "Type I diabetes (T1D) is caused by immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. This process is triggered, in part, by specific (aa 9-23) epitopes of the insulin \u0392 chain. Previously, fish insulins were used clinically in patients allergic to bovine or porcine insulin. Fish and human insulin differ by two amino acids in the critical immunogenic region (aa 9-23) of the B chain. We hypothesized that \u03b2 cells synthesizing fish insulin would be less immunogenic in a mouse model of T1D. Transgenic NOD mice in which Greater Amberjack fish (Seriola dumerili) insulin was substituted for the insulin 2 gene were generated (mouse Ins1-/- mouse Ins2-/- fish Ins2+/+). In these mice, pancreatic islets remained free of autoimmune attack. To determine whether such reduction in immunogenicity is sufficient to protect \u03b2 cells from autoimmunity upon transplantation, we transplanted fish Ins2 transgenic (expressing solely Seriola dumerili Ins2), NOD, or B16:A-dKO islets under the kidney capsules of 5 weeks old female NOD wildtype mice. The B:Y16A \u0392 chain substitution has been previously shown to be protective of T1D in NOD mice. NOD mice receiving Seriola dumerili transgenic islet transplants showed a significant (p\u2009=\u20090.004) prolongation of their euglycemic period (by 6 weeks; up to 18 weeks of age) compared to un-manipulated female NOD (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age) and those receiving B16:A-dKO islet transplants (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age). These data support the concept that specific amino acid sequence modifications can reduce insulin immunogenicity. Additionally, our study shows that alteration of a single epitope is not sufficient to halt an ongoing autoimmune response. Which, and how many, T cell epitopes are required and suffice to perpetuate autoimmunity is currently unknown.

We developed a humanized mouse model involving the introduction of autoreactive TCRs and cognate autoantigens that enables the analysis of selection of human T cells in human thymic tissue in vivo. Here, we describe the thymic development of MART1-specific autoreactive CD8+ T cells that normally escape deletion and how their phenotype and survival are affected by introduction of the missing epitope in the hematopoietic lineage. Expression of the epitope in a fraction of hematopoietic cells, including all major types of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), led to profound yet incomplete deletion of these T cells. Upregulation of PD-1 upon antigen encounter occurred through the different stages of thymocyte development. PD-1 and CCR7 expression were mutually exclusive in both transgenic and non-transgenic thymocytes, challenging the view that CCR7 is necessary for negative selection in humans. In the presence of antigen, MART1-reactive T cells down-regulated TCR, CD3, CD8, and CD4 in the thymus and periphery. Moreover, expression of secondary TCRs influences MHC class I-restricted T cells to develop as CD4+, particularly regulatory T cells.

Plasmid DNA (pDNA)-mediated expression of proinsulin has demonstrated transient protection in clinical trials, but long-lasting tolerance is yet to be achieved. We aimed to address whether pDNA delivery of multiple epitopes/mimotopes from several \u03b2-cell antigens efficiently presented to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could also induce tolerance. This approach significantly delayed T1D development, while co-delivery of pDNA vectors expressing four full antigens protected more mice. Delivery of multiple epitopes resulted in a broad engagement of specific T cells, eliciting a response distinct from endogenous epitopes draining from islets. T-cell phenotypes also varied with antigen specificity. Unexpectedly, the repertoire of T cells reactive to the same epitope was highly polyclonal.

These data suggest that during the progression of T1D, inflammation and hyperglycemia mediate the splicing of DEAF1 and loss of PTA expression in LNSCs by regulating the expression of SRSF10 and PTBP2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Alternative Splicing", "Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Inflammation", "Islets of Langerhans", "Lymph Nodes", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Pancreas", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Repressor Proteins", "Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors", "Spleen", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Yip", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA lindayip@stanford.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Fuhlbrigge", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Cariel", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Teppei", "Last Name": "Nishikawa-Matsumura", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Chan C", "Last Name": "Whiting", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Jill M", "Last Name": "Schartner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Rahima", "Last Name": "Akter", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "von Herrath", "Affiliation": "Type 1 Diabetes Center, The La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "C Garrison", "Last Name": "Fathman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2015Feb"}, {"PMID": "24357690", "Title": "It's time to bring dendritic cell therapy to type 1 diabetes.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Transplantation", "Dendritic Cells", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "R\u00e9mi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Giannoukakis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Trucco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Clare-Salzler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Garrison", "Last Name": "Fathman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "23621926", "Title": "[Superkines: cytokines displaying better targeted functions].", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cytokines", "Humans", "Immune System", "Interleukin-2", "Interleukin-4", "Interleukins", "Receptors, Cytokine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "R\u00e9mi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, 630 West 168th Street, Mail Box 127, New York, NY 10032, \u00c9tats-Unis. rjc2150@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Ignacio", "Last Name": "Moraga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Medecine sciences : M/S", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23296002", "Title": "Initiating type I diabetes: new suspects in the lineup.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Dendritic Cells", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Female", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Neutrophils"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "R\u00e9mi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "22923498", "Title": "Reduced DEAF1 function during type 1 diabetes inhibits translation in lymph node stromal cells by suppressing Eif4g3.", "Abstract": "The transcriptional regulator deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (DEAF1) has been suggested to play a role in maintaining peripheral tolerance by controlling the transcription of peripheral tissue antigen genes in lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). Here, we demonstrate that DEAF1 also regulates the translation of genes in LNSCs by controlling the transcription of the poorly characterized eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (Eif4g3) that encodes eIF4GII. Eif4g3 gene expression was reduced in the pancreatic lymph nodes of Deaf1-KO mice, non-obese diabetic mice, and type 1 diabetes patients, where functional Deaf1 is absent or diminished. Silencing of Deaf1 reduced Eif4g3 expression, but increased the expression of Caspase 3, a serine protease that degrades eIF4GII. Polysome profiling showed that reduced Eif4g3 expression in LNSCs resulted in the diminished translation of various genes, including Anpep, the gene for aminopeptidase N, an enzyme involved in fine-tuning antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Together these findings suggest that reduced DEAF1 function, and subsequent loss of Eif4g3 transcription may affect peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) expression in LNSCs and contribute to the pathology of T1D.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caspase 3", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Immune Tolerance", "Lymph Nodes", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, Knockout", "Pancreas", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Stromal Cells", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Yip", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cara T", "Last Name": "Pager", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Sarnow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Garrison", "Last Name": "Fathman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of molecular cell biology", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}]
