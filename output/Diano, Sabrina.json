Notably, metainflammation contributes to neuroinflammation due to the increased levels of circulating free fatty acids and cytokines. It indicates a strict interplay between peripheral and central counterparts in the pathogenic mechanisms of obesity-related mood disorders. In this context, the impairment of internal hypothalamic circuitry runs in tandem with the alteration of other brain areas associated with emotional processing (i.e., hippocampus and amygdala). Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator belonging to the N-acylethanolamines family, has been extensively studied for its pleiotropic effects both at central and peripheral level. Our study aimed to elucidate PEA capability in limiting obesity-induced anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation-related features in an experimental model of HFD-fed obese mice. PEA treatment promoted an improvement in anxiety-like behavior of obese mice and the systemic inflammation, reducing serum pro-inflammatory mediators (i.e., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, LPS). In the amygdala, PEA increased dopamine turnover, as well as GABA levels. PEA also counteracted the overactivation of HPA axis, reducing the expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and its type 1 receptor. Moreover, PEA attenuated the immunoreactivity of Iba-1 and GFAP and reduced pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokine production in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus. This finding, together with the reduced transcription of mast cell markers (chymase 1 and tryptase \u03b22) in the hippocampus, indicated the weakening of immune cell activation underlying the neuroprotective effect of PEA. Obesity-driven neuroinflammation was also associated with the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus. PEA limited the albumin extravasation and restored tight junction transcription modified by HFD. To gain mechanistic insight, we designed an in vitro model of metabolic injury using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells insulted by a mix of glucosamine and glucose. Here, PEA directly counteracted inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a PPAR-\u03b1-dependent manner since the pharmacological blockade of the receptor reverted its effects.

Many studies have indicated a positive correlation between depression and obesity, although weight loss and decreased appetite are also recognized as features of depression. Accordingly, DSM-5 defines two subtypes of depression associated with changes in feeding: melancholic depression, characterized by anhedonia and associated with decreased feeding and appetite; and atypical depression, characterized by fatigue, sleepiness, hyperphagia, and weight gain. The central nervous system plays a key role in the regulation of feeding and mood, thus suggesting that overlapping neuronal circuits may be involved in their modulation. However, these circuits have yet to be completely characterized. The central melanocortin system, a circuitry characterized by the expression of specific peptides (pro-opiomelanocortins, agouti-related protein, and neuropeptide Y) and their melanocortin receptors, has been shown to be a key player in the regulation of feeding. In addition, the melanocortin system has also been shown to affect anxiety and depressive-like behavior, thus suggesting a possible role of the melanocortin system as a biological substrate linking feeding and depression. However, more studies are needed to fully understand this complex system and its role in regulating metabolic and mood disorders.

We show that chemical promotion of CB1R activity increases feeding, and notably, CB1R activation also promotes neuronal activity of POMC cells. This paradoxical increase in POMC activity was crucial for CB1R-induced feeding, because designer-receptors-exclusively-activated-by-designer-drugs (DREADD)-mediated inhibition of POMC neurons diminishes, whereas DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons enhances CB1R-driven feeding. The Pomc gene encodes both the anorexigenic peptide \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the opioid peptide \u03b2-endorphin. CB1R activation selectively increases \u03b2-endorphin but not \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release in the hypothalamus, and systemic or hypothalamic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone blocks acute CB1R-induced feeding.

PREP knockdown mice (Prep(gt/gt)) exhibited glucose intolerance, decreased fasting insulin, increased fasting glucagon levels, and reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion compared with wild-type controls. Consistent with this, central infusion of a specific PREP inhibitor, S17092, impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin levels in wild-type mice. Arguing further for a central mode of action of PREP, isolated pancreatic islets showed no difference in glucose-induced insulin release between Prep(gt/gt) and wild-type mice. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showed no difference between Prep(gt/gt) and wild-type control mice. Central PREP regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion appears to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system because Prep(gt/gt) mice have elevated sympathetic outflow and norepinephrine levels in the pancreas, and propranolol treatment reversed glucose intolerance in these mice. Finally, re-expression of PREP by bilateral VMH injection of adeno-associated virus-PREP reversed the glucose-intolerant phenotype of the Prep(gt/gt) mice.

Alpha-MSH production is highly regulated both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Here we show that fasting induces a hypothalamic-specific up-regulation of Prcp mRNA and protein levels. Since fasting is characterized by elevated circulating ghrelin levels, we tested the effect of peripheral and central administration of ghrelin, and found that ghrelin increases hypothalamic Prcp mRNA expression. No changes in Prcp mRNA levels were detected in ghrelin knockout mice compared to their controls. Finally, ghrelin effect on PRCP expression was ghrelin receptor-mediated.

These phenomena were associated with an impaired thymic generation of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3(+)) naturally occurring regulatory T cells and their reduced suppressive capacity in the periphery, which resulted in increased delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and autoimmune disease susceptibility in mice.

To accomplish this, a precise balance of production and degradation of \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide and product of the POMC gene, in the hypothalamus, is crucial. Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is a key enzyme that degrades \u03b1-MSH to an inactive form unable to inhibit food intake.

Combining genetic, anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, we show that PREP genetrap mice have decreased synaptic spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation, impaired hippocampal-mediated learning and memory, and reduced growth-associated protein-43 levels when compared with wild-type controls.
