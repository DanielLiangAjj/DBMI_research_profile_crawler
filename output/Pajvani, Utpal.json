[{"PMID": "38578141", "Title": "The first MASH drug therapy on the horizon: Current perspectives of resmetirom.", "Abstract": "The rising prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) poses a significant global health challenge, affecting over 30% of adults worldwide. MASLD is linked to increased mortality rates and substantial healthcare costs, primarily driven by its progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to severe liver complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its growing burden, effective pharmacotherapy for MASLD/MASH has been lacking until the recent conditional approval of resmetirom by the FDA. Resmetirom, a liver-targeted thyroid hormone receptor-\u03b2 selective drug, has shown promise in clinical trials for treating non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis. It has demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic fat content, improving liver histology (both MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement), and ameliorating biomarkers of liver damage without significant effects on body weight or glucose metabolism. Notably, resmetirom also exhibits favourable effects on circulating lipids, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk in MASLD/MASH patients. The safety profile of resmetirom appears acceptable, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most common, though generally mild or moderate. However, long-term surveillance is warranted to monitor for potential risks related to thyroid, gonadal, or bone diseases. Clinical implementation of resmetirom faces challenges in patient selection and monitoring treatment response, and will heavily rely on non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis assessment. Nonetheless, resmetirom represents a landmark breakthrough in MASLD/MASH treatment, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies aiming to mitigate the multifaceted risks associated with this complex metabolic liver disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Fatty Liver", "Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver", "Pyridazines", "Uracil"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "Petta", "Affiliation": "Gastroenterology and Hepatology, PROMISE, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Targher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Romeo", "Affiliation": "Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ming-Hua", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatology, MAFLD Research Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Alessio", "Last Name": "Aghemo", "Affiliation": "Division of Internal Medicine and Hepatology, Department of Gastroenterology, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Luca V C", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy."}], "Journal": "Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver", "PubDate": "2024Jul"}, {"PMID": "38557494", "Title": "Protective hepatocyte signals restrain liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.", "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects nearly 40% of the global adult population and may progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and MASH-associated liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

We focus particularly on the relative preservation of insulin's stimulation of triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis despite its waning ability to curb hepatic glucose production (HGP). To explain this apparent 'selective insulin resistance', we propose that hepatocellular processes that lead to TG accumulation require less insulin signal transduction, or 'insulinization,' than do those that regulate HGP. As such, mounting hyperinsulinaemia that barely compensates for aberrant HGP in insulin-resistant states more than suffices to maintain hepatic TG biosynthesis. Thus, even modestly elevated or context-inappropriate insulin levels, when sustained day and night within a heavily pro-lipogenic metabolic milieu, may translate into substantial cumulative TG biosynthesis in the insulin-resistant state.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Triglycerides", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Insulin", "Glucose", "Liver"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua R", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York City, NY, USA. jrc2175@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Meredith A", "Last Name": "Hawkins", "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research and Training Center, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York City, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature metabolism", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37213714", "Title": "Acetylation of PPAR\u03b3 in macrophages promotes visceral fat degeneration in obesity.", "Abstract": "Obesity is characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation, which is driven by macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue. PPAR\u03b3 is well established to have an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages, but the mechanism that regulates its function in these cells remains to be fully elucidated. PPAR\u03b3 undergoes post-translational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, to mediate ligand responses, including on metabolic functions. Here, we report that PPAR\u03b3 acetylation in macrophages promotes their infiltration into adipose tissue, exacerbating metabolic dysregulation. We generated a mouse line that expresses a macrophage-specific, constitutive acetylation-mimetic form of PPAR\u03b3 (K293Qflox/flox:LysM-cre, mK293Q) to dissect the role of PPAR\u03b3 acetylation in macrophages.

Overall, these data implicate an adipocyte PHLPP2-HSL-PPAR\u03b1 signaling axis to regulate systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis, and suggest that excess adipocyte PHLPP2 explains decreased adiponectin secretion and downstream metabolic consequence in obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipocytes", "Adiponectin", "Adipose Tissue", "Adiposity", "Animals", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Acids", "Fatty Liver", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glucose", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipolysis", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Obese", "Obesity", "PPAR alpha", "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases", "Phosphorylation", "Signal Transduction", "Sterol Esterase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "KyeongJin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. kimkj@inha.ac.kr."}, {"First Name": "Jin Ku", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young Hoon", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sang Bae", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Raffaela", "Last Name": "Rametta", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, DEPT, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Dongiovanni", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, DEPT, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, DEPT, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. up2104@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2021Mar23"}, {"PMID": "33634751", "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)1.", "Abstract": "In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.", "Keywords": ["Autophagosome", "LC3", "cancer", "flux", "lysosome", "macroautophagy", "neurodegeneration", "phagophore", "stress", "vacuole"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagosomes", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Biological Assay", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Lysosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Klionsky", "Affiliation": "Life Sciences Institute and Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amal Kamal", "Last Name": "Abdel-Aziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt;

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranges in severity from simple steatosis, a benign 'pre-disease' state, to the liver injury and inflammation that characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn predisposes individuals to liver fibrosis. Fibrosis is the major determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and is associated with increased risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH has no approved therapies, and liver fibrosis shows poor response to existing pharmacotherapy, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Patient and mouse data have shown that NASH is associated with the activation of developmental pathways: Notch, Hedgehog and Hippo-YAP-TAZ. Although these evolutionarily conserved fundamental signals are known to determine liver morphogenesis during development, new data have shown a coordinated and causal role for these pathways in the liver injury response, which becomes maladaptive during obesity-associated chronic liver disease. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology of this reactivation of developmental pathways and review the cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms by which developmental pathways influence disease progression.

Novel targets for alteration of inflammatory signalling are needed to improve obesity-related outcomes. The \u03b3-secretase enzyme complex has been suggested to play a role both in adipocyte function as well as in immune regulation. We hypothesized that adipocyte-specific \u03b3-secretase inhibition could alter the inflammatory makeup of adipose tissue. We found that genetic blockade of \u03b3-secretase in adipocytes leads to a decrease in EMR1 (F4/80) expression, as a marker of macrophage presence, in adipose tissue without changes in expression of markers of other inflammatory cell types. To explore the mechanism by which adipocytes can alter macrophage function in vitro, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transcription of IL6 and ccl2 (MCP1) were quantified. IL-6 expression and secretion were significantly inhibited by \u03b3-secretase blockade, with little effect on MCP1. Preconditioned media from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor also alters macrophage activation but did not affect macrophage translocation in vitro. Therefore, \u03b3-secretase inhibition in fully differentiated adipocytes can alter IL-6 signalling to macrophages, consistent with our hypothesis that that \u03b3-secretase is involved in adipocyte-initiated inflammatory signalling cascades.", "Keywords": ["Adipocyte", "IL-6", "gamma-secretase", "inflammation", "macrophage"], "MeSH terms": ["3T3-L1 Cells", "Adipocytes", "Adipose Tissue", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cytokines", "Inflammation Mediators", "Interleukin-6", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophage Activation", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Panniculitis", "Protease Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Sparling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center , Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nile", "Last Name": "McCullough", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center , Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Utpal", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary Beth", "Last Name": "Humphrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center , Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}], "Journal": "Adipocyte", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32441510", "Title": "Targeted Delivery of Notch Inhibitor Attenuates Obesity-Induced Glucose Intolerance and Liver Fibrosis.", "Abstract": "As the prevalence of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) continue to increase, the need for pharmacologic therapies becomes urgent. However, endeavors to identify and develop novel therapeutic strategies for these chronic conditions are balanced by the need for safety, impeding clinical translation. One shared pathology of these two diseases is a maladaptive reactivation of the Notch signaling pathway in liver. Notch antagonism with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors effectively suppresses hepatic glucose production and reduces liver fibrosis in NASH, but its extrahepatic side effects, particularly goblet cell metaplasia, limit therapeutic utility. To overcome this barrier, we developed a nanoparticle-mediated delivery system to target \u03b3-secretase inhibitor to liver (GSI NPs). GSI NP application reduced hepatic glucose production in diet-induced obese mice and reduced hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in mice fed a NASH-provoking diet, without apparent gastrointestinal toxicity.

The mechanism(s) of the apparent causal relationships between these medications and metabolic effects have been inadequately defined and are potentially confounded by genetic risk of mental illness, attendant lifestyle, and concomitant medications. Therefore, we conducted a study in which 24 healthy volunteers were randomized to olanzapine (highly weight-gain liability), iloperidone (less weight-gain liability), or placebo treatment for 28 days under double-blind conditions. We hypothesized that antipsychotics induce weight gain primarily through increased caloric intake, which causes secondary dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Subjects were phenotyped pre- and post-treatment for body weight, adiposity by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, food intake, oral glucose tolerance, plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, and other hormones.

We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak.

Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have palmitate-induced ROS or mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that palmitate induces mitochondrial ROS that is amplified by NOX2, causing greater mitochondrial ROS generation and partial depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of hepatic Notch signaling in obese mice simultaneously improves glucose tolerance and reduces hepatic triglyceride content. As such, we predicted that Notch signaling in human liver would be positively associated with insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Here, we systematically survey Notch signaling in liver biopsy specimens, and show active Notch signaling in lean and obese adults, with expression of multiple Notch receptors and ligands. In morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we show that Notch activation positively correlates with glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) expression, key regulators of hepatic glucose output. We used immunofluorescence to identify active Notch signaling in hepatocytes and show highest activity in hyperglycemia, which we confirmed is a direct effect of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. In a validation cohort of leaner individuals undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy for suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Notch activity showed independent positive association with insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Notably, Notch activity showed stronger correlation with the NAFLD activity score and alanine aminotransferase levels than with steatosis alone, suggesting that Notch activity is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In summary, this study establishes that Notch signaling is activated in and may represent a therapeutic target for patients with obesity-related liver disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alanine Transaminase", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Glucose-6-Phosphatase", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Insulin Resistance", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Obesity", "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Internal Medicine, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ca' Granda, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Rosa M", "Last Name": "Mendoza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raffaela", "Last Name": "Rametta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Maggioni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carrie J", "Last Name": "Shawber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "23832089", "Title": "Inhibition of Notch uncouples Akt activation from hepatic lipid accumulation by decreasing mTorc1 stability.", "Abstract": "Increased hepatic lipid content is an early correlate of insulin resistance and can be caused by nutrient-induced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor). This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis. These data identify Notch as a therapeutically actionable branch point of metabolic signaling at which Akt activation in the liver can be uncoupled from hepatosteatosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Body Weight", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Diet, High-Fat", "Enzyme Activation", "Fatty Liver", "Gene Expression Regulation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Male", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Protein Stability", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. up2104@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thaned", "Last Name": "Kangsamaksin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}]
