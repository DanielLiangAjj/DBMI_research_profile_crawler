[{"PMID": "38859115", "Title": "Imaging performance prediction of a hypersonic target in a geosynchronous orbit based on multi-dimensional information correlation of radiation, multi-spectral, and polarization.", "Abstract": "Hypersonic target detection based on infrared intensity characteristics is easily disturbed by sea surface and cloud flares when detected by space-based optical systems, which results in a low detection rate, high false alarm, and difficulty in stable detection. This paper explores a method to improve target detection performance based on the correlation of infrared radiation, multi-spectral and polarization. Firstly, the comprehensive factors that influence complex ambient illumination, atmospheric transmission, and clutter background on spectral-polarization characteristics of hypersonic targets are analyzed. Based on the global radiation scattering theory, the temperature distribution model of the hypersonic target is established by using FLUENT. The polarization emission and pBRDF model of the target is established, and the radiation polarization transfer model is generated. Secondly, the sea surface temperature distribution is obtained by inversion of Landsat8 remote sensing data. The radiation polarization transfer model of the sea surface is established based on the Cox-Munk model combined with pBRDF and the polarization emission model. Thirdly, the polarization scattering effect of atmospheric particles on the upward radiation of the interaction of the target with the sunlight is considered comprehensively, and the 6SV radiative transfer model is used to calculate the polarization effect of atmospheric particles on the upward radiation transmission of the target and the background. Then, combined with the point diffusion of the optical system and the photoelectric conversion of the detector, the multi-dimensional full-chain imaging prediction model of the hypersonic target-sea background-ambient atmosphere-optical system-detector is established. The imaging characteristics and detection performance of the target in different imaging dimensions are simulated and analyzed with the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). The research shows that in the direction of reflected sunlight from the sea surface, the sea surface glare is suppressed and the target is highlighted through a target detection method of multi-dimensional information. This method has better detection results than the infrared multi-spectral detection method.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hang", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Rui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yiping", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiahui", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Optics express", "PubDate": "2024May20"}, {"PMID": "38681134", "Title": "A sustainable balance between innovation and risk: How the \"right to science\" affects China's medical biotechnology regulatory policy.", "Abstract": "Medical biotechnology is at the forefront of scientific progress, with humanity facing a critical juncture during the pandemic. However, to maximize these benefits, governments face the complex challenge of reconciling innovation and risk. A sustainable balance is critical, as extreme measures such as blanket bans on biotechnology research could hamper progress, while unfettered research could pose an existential threat. The need for effective regulation has become apparent in the context of recent controversies surrounding pharmaceutical biotechnology. Governments face the challenge of reconciling precaution with innovation, necessitating a dual strategy fostering both principles. This paper explores the delicate dynamics of innovation and risk in pharmaceutical biotechnology, focusing on the evolving landscape in Europe, the U.S., and, notably, China. At the same time, we delve into the regulatory landscape and examine the role of the \"right to science\" in shaping Chinese policy. This paper further applies the right to science that has received the interests of medical biotechnology regulatory policymakers: understanding the role of scientific claims in regulating emerging technologies and analyzing the impact of major regulations on the ability to sustainably balance innovation and risk. We believe that a comprehensive global effort is needed to harmonize these two principles, highlighting the imperative of responsible governance in steering the trajectory of this powerful scientific frontier.

However, numerous dynamically tunable metasurfaces are only operating at a single frequency point or in a narrow range, limiting the further possibility of the devices to meet contemporary broad-spectrum biosensing requirements. In this paper, a novel compact biosensor is proposed with an ultrawide resonance frequency agile channel shifted from 0.82 to 1.85 THz, with a tuning functionality up to 55.7%. In addition, under optical pumping irradiation, the modulator with ultra-fast response is able to complete the ultra-wideband resonant mode conversion from the Fano mode to the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) mode within 4 ps, and achieves a frequency shift sensitivity of 118 GHz RIU-1 and 247 GHz RIU-1 at 0.82 and 1.85 THz, respectively.

Complete MO removal and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) efficiencies (>90%) can be achieved after 3 min treatments of the aqueous MO with the calcined eggshell-derived CuCa HDS materials. The spent, deactivated HDS materials can be regenerated by an acid wash method. The activity of CuCa HDS materials in MO removal is unaffected by eggshell sources, implying that sorting steps may be unnecessary when eggshell food waste (duck, quail, and hen eggshells) is collected to produce biobased CaO.

Numerical results show that the extinction coefficient of particles is mainly affected by the humidity, and the scattering efficiency is affected by both temperature and humidity.

Fn encodes a unique amyloid-like adhesin, FadA complex (FadAc), consisting of intact pre-FadA and cleaved mature FadA, to promote colorectal cancer tumorigenesis. We aimed to evaluate circulating anti-FadAc antibody levels as a biomarker for colorectal cancer. Circulating anti-FadAc IgA and IgG levels were measured by ELISA in two study populations. In study 1, plasma samples from patients with colorectal cancer (n = 25) and matched healthy controls (n = 25) were obtained from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Plasma levels of anti-FadAc IgA were significantly increased in patients with colorectal cancer (mean \u00b1 SD: 1.48 \u00b1 1.07 \u03bcg/mL) compared with matched healthy controls (0.71 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcg/mL; P = 0.001).

In study 2, sera from patients with colorectal cancer (n = 50) and patients with advanced colorectal adenomas (n = 50) were obtained from the Weill Cornell Medical Center biobank. Anti-FadAc antibody titers were stratified according to the tumor stage and location. Similar as study 1, serum levels of anti-FadAc IgA were significantly increased in patients with colorectal cancer (2.06 \u00b1 1.47 \u03bcg/mL) compared with patients with colorectal adenomas (1.49 \u00b1 0.99 \u03bcg/mL; P = 0.025).

We set out to test the potential role and extent of microbial infection in stillbirth through a case-control analysis of fetal cord blood collected from the multisite Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network. Cases (n\u2009=\u200960) were defined as stillbirths at >20\u2009weeks of gestation, and controls (n\u2009=\u2009176) were live births. The bacterial presence, abundance, and composition were analyzed by endpoint PCR of full-length 16S rRNA and the V4 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The results demonstrate that bacterial prevalence and abundance were both significantly increased in stillbirth, even after adjusting for maternal age, race, body mass index, number of pregnancies, gestational age, and multiple gestations. Composition of bacterial communities in the cord blood also differed significantly. Using a group of 25 ASVs differentially abundant between the two groups, a Random Forest classification model achieved an accuracy score of 0.76 differentiating stillbirth and live birth, with Group B Streptococcus as the most enriched species in stillbirth. Positive PCR was also significantly associated with early preterm birth. A group of oral anaerobes, including Actinomyces, Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, were enriched in live early preterm birth, suggesting possible oral origin of infection. Our ASV-based microbiome analysis revealed specific candidate pathogens associated with infections in stillbirth and early preterm birth. The cord blood microbial signatures may be markers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our study will help identify possible mechanism of infection and improve our ability to prevent stillbirth and early preterm birth. IMPORTANCE Stillbirth accounts for half of all perinatal mortality, but the underlying cause of a substantial portion of all cases remains elusive. We examined the umbilical cord blood microbiome in stillbirths (n\u2009=\u200960) and live births (n\u2009=\u2009176) and discovered that the bacterial prevalence and abundance were significantly higher in stillbirths than live births. The microbial compositions also differed significantly. Group B Streptococcus was the most prevalent species detected in stillbirth. In addition, pathogens previously unknown to be associated with stillbirth were identified. A group of oral anaerobes including Fusobacterium nucleatum were found to be specifically enriched in the cord blood in early preterm live birth. This is by far the most comprehensive study to examine the microbial signatures in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood microbial signatures may be markers for adverse birth outcomes.

Periodontitis is an infectious/inflammatory disease that destroys the supporting periodontal structure leading to tooth loss. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome plays a significant role in the onset and development of periodontitis exhibiting a shift to overgrowth of pathobionts in the normal microflora with increasing local inflammation. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common pathogen that significantly overgrows in periodontitis and has also been linked to various systemic diseases. Earlier studies have reported that antibodies to F. nucleatum can be detected in the serum of patients with AD or cognitive impairment, but a causal relationship and a plausible mechanism linking the two diseases have not been identified. In this study, we conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments and found that F. nucleatum activates microglial cells causing morphological changes, accelerated proliferation and enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in microglial cells. In our in vivo experiments, we found that F. nucleatum-induced periodontitis resulted in the exacerbation of Alzheimer's symptoms in 5XFAD mice including increased cognitive impairment, beta-amyloid accumulation and Tau protein phosphorylation in the mouse cerebrum. This study may suggest a possible link between a periodontal pathogen and AD and F. nucleatum could be a risk factor in the pathogenesis of AD. We are currently further identifying the pathways through which F. nucleatum modulates molecular elements in enhancing AD symptoms and signs.

The oral cavity harbors a diverse group of Fusobacterium, and it is postulated that F. nucleatum in the GI tract originate from the mouth. It is not known, however, if all oral Fusobacterium translocate to the GI sites with equal efficiencies. Therefore, we amplified 16S rRNA genes of F. nucleatum and F. periodonticum, two closely related oral species from matched saliva, gastric aspirates, and colon or ileal pouch aspirates of three patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and three healthy controls, and saliva alone from seven patients with either active IBD or IBD in remission. The 16S rRNA gene amplicons were cloned, and the DNA sequences determined by Sanger sequencing. The results demonstrate that fusobacterial community composition differs more significantly between the oral and GI sites than between different individuals. The oral communities demonstrate the highest level of variation and have the richest pool of unique sequences, with certain nodes/strains enriched in the GI tract and others diminished during translocation. The gastric and colon/pouch communities exhibit reduced diversity and are more closely related, possibly due to selective pressure in the GI tract.

We investigated the relationship between the subcellular distribution and stress-induced activation of BGLU18 (BG1), an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme critical for abiotic stress responses, in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. High BGLU18 levels were present in leaf petioles, primarily in endoplasmic reticulum bodies. These Brassicaceae-specific endoplasmic reticulum-derived organelles responded dynamically to abiotic stress, particularly drought-induced dehydration, by changing in number and size. Under stress, BGLU18 distribution shifted toward microsomes, which was accompanied by increasing BGLU18-mediated ABA-GE hydrolytic activity and ABA levels in leaf petioles. Under non-stress conditions, impaired endoplasmic reticulum body formation caused a microsomal shift of BGLU18 and increased its enzyme activity; however, ABA levels increased only under stress, probably because ABA-GE is supplied to the endoplasmic reticulum only under these conditions. Loss of BGLU18 delayed dehydration-induced ABA accumulation, suggesting that ABA-GE hydrolysis precedes the biosynthesis.

By introducing vector potential in the Lorentz gauge, the electromagnetic field components of the Bessel-Gaussian beam are determined under the paraxial approximation. Through numerical calculations, the propagation of the Bessel-Gaussian beam in a chiral medium is examined. Results show that Bessel-Gaussian beams split into the left circularly polarized beam and the right circularly polarized beam with different propagation trajectories. The propagation trajectory of the Bessel-Gaussian beam can be controlled by varying half-cone angles of the Bessel-Gaussian beam and the chiral parameter of the medium. The dynamical characteristics, including energy, momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum, of Bessel-Gaussian beams in a chiral medium are also simulated and discussed in detail.

We demonstrate that Fn adheres to, invades, and induces oncogenic and inflammatory responses to stimulate growth of CRC cells through its unique FadA adhesin. FadA binds to E-cadherin, activates \u03b2-catenin signaling, and differentially regulates the inflammatory and oncogenic responses. The FadA-binding site on E-cadherin is mapped to an 11-amino-acid region. A synthetic peptide derived from this region of E-cadherin abolishes FadA-induced CRC cell growth and oncogenic and inflammatory responses. The fadA gene levels in the colon tissue from patients with adenomas and adenocarcinomas are >10-100 times higher compared to normal individuals. The increased FadA expression in CRC correlates with increased expression of oncogenic and inflammatory genes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of USP14 in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and to define its role in lung cancer cell proliferation. USP14 mRNA levels in different non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were detected by real-time qPCR. USP14 protein levels in surgically resected samples from NSCLC patients, and in NSCLC cell lines, were detected by immunohistochemistry or Western blot. The correlation of USP14 expression with clinical characteristics and prognosis was determined by survival analysis. After silencing USP14, cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and the cell cycle was measured by FACS assay. It was found that USP14 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells, especially in adenocarcinoma cells. Over-expression of USP14 was associated with shorter overall survival of patients. Downregulation of USP14 expression arrested the cell cycle, which may be related to \u03b2-catenin degradation.
