[{"PMID": "38941996", "Title": "A biopsy-sized 3D skin model with a perifollicular vascular plexus enables studying immune cell trafficking in the skin.", "Abstract": "Human skin vasculature features a unique anatomy in close proximity to the skin appendages and acts as a gatekeeper for constitutive lymphocyte trafficking to the skin. Approximating such structural complexity and functionality in 3D skin models is an outstanding tissue engineering challenge. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of the digital-light-processing (DLP) bioprinting to generate an anatomically-relevant and miniaturized 3D skin-on-a-chip (3D-SoC) model in the size of a 6 mm punch biopsy. The 3D-SoC contains a perfusable vascular network resembling the superficial vascular plexus of the skin and closely surrounding bioengineered hair follicles. The perfusion capabilities of the 3D-SoC enables the circulation of immune cells, and high-resolution imaging of the immune cell-endothelial cell interactions, namely rolling, tethering and extravasation in real-time. Moreover, the vascular pattern in 3D-SoC captures the physiological range of shear rates found in cutaneous blood vessels and allows for studying the effect of shear rate on T cell trafficking. In 3D-SoC, as expected, in vitro-polarized T helper 1 (Th1) cells show a stronger attachment on the vasculature compared to na\u00efve T cells. Both na\u00efve and T cells exhibit higher retention in the low-shear zones in the early stages (< 5 min) of T cell attachment. Interestingly, at later stages T cell retention rate becomes independent of the shear rate. The attached Th1 cells further transmigrate from the vessel walls to the extracellular space and migrate toward the bioengineered hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis. When the epidermis is not present, Th1 cell migration toward the epidermis is significantly hindered, underscoring the role of epidermal signals on T cell infiltration. Our data validates the capabilities of 3D-SoC model to study the interactions between immune cells and skin vasculature in the context of epidermal signals. The biopsy-sized 3D-SoC model in this study represents a new level of anatomical and cellular complexity, and brings us a step closer to generating a truly functional human skin with its tissue-specific vasculature and appendages in the presence of circulating immune cells.", "Keywords": ["Engineered skin", "bioprinted skin", "hair follicles", "immune cells", "microphysiological systems", "skin-on-a-chip", "vasculature"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krutav Rakesh", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, 1210 Amsterdam Ave, New York, 10027-6902, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Garriga-Cerda", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 1150 Saint Nicholas Ave., New York, 10032-3784, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Pappalardo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 1150 Saint Nicholas Ave., New York, 10032-3784, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Leila", "Last Name": "Sorrells", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, 1210 Amsterdam Ave, New York, 10027-6902, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Hun Jin", "Last Name": "Jeong", "Affiliation": "Regenerative Engineering Laboratory , Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 1150 Saint Nicholas Ave., New York, 10032-3784, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Chang H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Regenerative Engineering Laboratory , Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 1150 Saint Nicholas Ave., New York, 10032-3784, UNITED STATES."}, {"First Name": "Hasan Erbil", "Last Name": "Abaci", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 1150 Saint Nicholas Ave., New York, New York, 10032-3784, UNITED STATES."}], "Journal": "Biofabrication", "PubDate": "2024Jun28"}, {"PMID": "38716141", "Title": "Organ-specific vasculature-on-a-chip systems.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hasan Erbil", "Last Name": "Abaci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mandy B", "Last Name": "Esch", "Affiliation": "Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, USA."}], "Journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38452278", "Title": "Efficient Generation of Skin Organoids from Pluripotent Cells via Defined Extracellular Matrix Cues and Morphogen Gradients in a Spindle-Shaped Microfluidic Device.", "Abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived skin organoids (PSOs) emerge as a developmental skin model that is self-organized into multiple components, such as hair follicles. Despite their impressive complexity, PSOs are currently generated in the absence of 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) signals and have several major limitations, including an inverted anatomy (e.g., epidermis inside/dermis outside). In this work, a method is established to generate PSOs effectively in a chemically-defined 3D ECM environment. After examining various dermal ECM molecules, it is found that PSOs generated in collagen\u00a0-type I (COLI) supplemented with laminin 511 (LAM511) exhibit increased growth compared to conventional free-floating conditions, but fail to induce complete skin differentiation due in part to necrosis. This problem is addressed by generating the PSOs in a 3D bioprinted spindle-shaped hydrogel device, which constrains organoid growth longitudinally. This culture system significantly reduces organoid necrosis and leads to a twofold increase in keratinocyte differentiation and an eightfold increase in hair follicle formation. Finally, the system is adapted as a microfluidic device to create asymmetrical gradients of differentiation factors and improves the spatial organization of dermal and epidermal cells.

High-fidelity in vitro models of the BBB could facilitate effective early screening of drug candidates targeting the brain. In this study, we developed a microfluidic BBB model that is capable of mimicking in vivo BBB characteristics for a prolonged period and allows for reliable in vitro drug permeability studies under recirculating perfusion. We derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and cocultured them with rat primary astrocytes on the two sides of a porous membrane on a pumpless microfluidic platform for up to 10 days. The microfluidic system was designed based on the blood residence time in human brain tissues, allowing for medium recirculation at physiologically relevant perfusion rates with no pumps or external tubing, meanwhile minimizing wall shear stress to test whether shear stress is required for in vivo-like barrier properties in a microfluidic BBB model. This BBB-on-a-chip model achieved significant barrier integrity as evident by continuous tight junction formation and in vivo-like values of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The TEER levels peaked above 4000\u2009\u03a9\u2009\u00b7\u2009cm2 on day 3 on chip and were sustained above 2000\u2009\u03a9\u2009\u00b7\u2009cm2 up to 10 days, which are the highest sustained TEER values reported in a microfluidic model. We evaluated the capacity of our microfluidic BBB model to be used for drug permeability studies using large molecules (FITC-dextrans) and model drugs (caffeine, cimetidine, and doxorubicin). Our analyses demonstrated that the permeability coefficients measured using our model were comparable to in vivo values. Our BBB-on-a-chip model closely mimics physiological BBB barrier functions and will be a valuable tool for screening of drug candidates. The residence time-based design of a microfluidic platform will enable integration with other organ modules to simulate multi-organ interactions on drug response. Biotechnol.

Oxygen levels within the hydrogel in atmospheric (21 %), hypoxic (5 %), and severely hypoxic (1 %) conditions were assessed with a mathematical model. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, encapsulated within the AHA hydrogels in high densities, generated nonuniform oxygen distributions, while lower cell densities resulted in more uniform oxygen distributions in the atmospheric and hypoxic environments. When we examined how varying viscoelasticity in atmospheric and hypoxic environments affects cell cycles and the expression of BNIP3 and BNIP3L (autophagy and apoptosis genes), and GLUT-1 (a glucose transport gene), we observed that HT1080 cells in 3D hydrogel adapted better to hypoxic conditions than those in a Petri dish, with no obvious correlation to matrix viscoelasticity, by recovering rapidly from possible autophagy/apoptotic events and alternating metabolism mechanisms. Further, we examined how HT1080 cells cultured in varying viscoelasticity and oxygen tension conditions affected endothelial sprouting and invasion. We observed that increased matrix stiffness reduced endothelial sprouting and invasion in atmospheric conditions; however, we observed increased endothelial sprouting and invasion under hypoxia at all levels of matrix stiffness with the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoeitin-1 (ANG-1). Overall, HT1080 cells encapsulated in the AHA hydrogels under hypoxic stress recovered better from apoptosis and demonstrated greater angiogenic induction. Thus, we propose that oxygen tension more profoundly influences cell fate and the angiogenic potential of 3D cultured HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells than does matrix stiffness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu-I", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}, {"First Name": "Hasan E", "Last Name": "Abaci", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}, {"First Name": "Yoni", "Last Name": "Krupsi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}, {"First Name": "Lien-Chun", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Burdick", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Gerecht", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218."}], "Journal": "Biomaterials science", "PubDate": "2014May01"}]
