[{"PMID": "38656811", "Title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lipid A Structural Variants Induce Altered Immune Responses.", "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in structural lung damage and progressive pulmonary decline. P. aeruginosa in the CF lung undergoes numerous changes, adapting to host-specific airway pressures while establishing chronic infection. P. aeruginosa undergoes lipid A structural modification during CF chronic infection, not seen in any other disease state. Lipid A, the membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide (i.e., endotoxin), comprises the majority of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is a potent toll-like receptor (TLR)4 agonist. The structure of P. aeruginosa lipid A is intimately linked with its recognition by TLR4, and subsequent immune response. Prior work has identified P. aeruginosa strains with altered lipid A structures that arise during chronic CF lung infection; however, the impact of P. aeruginosa lipid A structure on airway disease has not been investigated. Here, we show that P. aeruginosa lipid A lacks PagL-mediated deacylation during human airway infection using a direct-from-sample mass spectrometry approach on human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This structure triggers increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by primary human macrophages. Furthermore, alterations in lipid A 2-hydroxylation impact cytokine response in a site-specific manner, independent of CFTR function. Interestingly, there is a CF-specific reduction in IL-8 secretion within the epithelial-cell compartment that only occurs in CF bronchial epithelial cells when infected with CF-adapted P. aeruginosa that lack PagL-mediated lipid A deacylation. Taken together, we show that P. aeruginosa alters its lipid A structure during acute lung infection and that this lipid A structure induces stronger signaling through TLR4.", "Keywords": ["Cystic fibrosis", "LPS", "MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Casey E", "Last Name": "Hofstaedter", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland School of Medicine, 12264, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ian P", "Last Name": "O'Keefe", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Baltimore, 12265, Microbial Pathogenesis, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Charles M", "Last Name": "Met", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Baltimore, 12265, Microbial Pathogenesis, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 14640, Microbiology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jelly", "Last Name": "Vanderwoude", "Affiliation": "Georgia Tech, 1372, Biology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sunny", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 14640, Microbiology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Diggle", "Affiliation": "Georgia Tech, 1372, Biology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian A", "Last Name": "Riquelme", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Pediatrics, NEW YORK, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Rasko", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland School of Medicine, 12264, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yohei", "Last Name": "Doi", "Affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States."}, {"First Name": "Janette M", "Last Name": "Harro", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Baltimore, 12265, Microbial Pathogenesis, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Kopp", "Affiliation": "Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Inc, 1367, Pediatrics, ATLANTA, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert K", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Baltimore, 12265, Microbial Pathogenesis, Baltimore, Maryland, United States; rkernst@umaryland.edu."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr24"}, {"PMID": "38310854", "Title": "Immunometabolic Regulation of Bacterial Infection, Biofilms, and Antibiotic Susceptibility.", "Abstract": "Upon infection, mucosal tissues activate a brisk inflammatory response to clear the pathogen, i.e., resistance to disease.

Pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus, are typically associated with infection in patients with underlying pulmonary disease or damage, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To establish infection, bacteria express a well-defined set of so-called virulence factors that facilitate colonization and activate an immune response, gene products that have been identified in murine models. Less well-understood are the adaptive changes that occur over time in vivo, enabling the organisms to evade innate and adaptive immune clearance mechanisms. These colonizers proliferate, generating a population sufficient to provide selection for mutants, such as small colony variants and mucoid variants, that are optimized for long term infection. Such host-adapted strains have evolved in response to selective pressure such as antibiotics and the recruitment of phagocytes at sites of infection and their release of signaling metabolites (e.g., succinate). These metabolites can potentially function as substrates for bacterial growth and but also generate oxidant stress. Whole genome sequencing and quantified expression of selected genes have helped to explain how P. aeruginosa and S. aureus adapt to the presence of these metabolites over the course of in vivo infection. The serial isolation of clonally related strains from patients with cystic fibrosis has provided the opportunity to identify bacterial metabolic pathways that are altered under this immune pressure, such as the anti-oxidant glyoxylate and pentose phosphate pathways, routes contributing to the generation of biofilms. These metabolic pathways and biofilm itself enable the organisms to dissipate oxidant stress, while providing protection from phagocytosis.

Infection with hRSV produces abundant infiltration of immune cells into the airways, which combined with an exacerbated pro-inflammatory immune response can lead to significant damage to the lungs. Human RSV re-infection is extremely frequent, suggesting that this virus may have evolved molecular mechanisms that interfere with host adaptive immunity. Infection with hRSV can be reduced by administering a humanized neutralizing antibody against the virus fusion protein in high-risk infants. Although neutralizing antibodies against hRSV effectively block the infection of airway epithelial cells, here we show that both, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and lung DCs undergo infection with IgG-coated virus (hRSV-IC), albeit abortive. Yet, this is enough to negatively modulate DC function. We observed that such a process is mediated by Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) expressed on the surface of DCs. Remarkably, we also observed that in the absence of hRSV-specific antibodies Fc\u03b3RIII knockout mice displayed significantly less cellular infiltration in the lungs after hRSV infection, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting a potentially harmful, IgG-independent role for this receptor in hRSV disease. Our findings support the notion that Fc\u03b3Rs can contribute significantly to the modulation of DC function by hRSV and hRSV-IC.

The recurrent hRSV outbreaks and reinfections are the cause of a significant public health burden and associate with an inefficient antiviral immunity, even after disease resolution. Although several mouse- and human cell-based studies have shown that hRSV infection prevents na\u00efve T-cell activation by antigen-presenting cells, the mechanism underlying such inhibition remains unknown. Here, we show that the hRSV nucleoprotein (N) could be at least partially responsible for inhibiting T-cell activation during infection by this virus. Early after infection, the N protein was expressed on the surface of epithelial and dendritic cells, after interacting with trans-Golgi and lysosomal compartments. Further, experiments on supported lipid bilayers loaded with peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes showed that surface-anchored N protein prevented immunological synapse assembly by naive CD4(+) T cells and, to a lesser extent, by antigen-experienced T-cell blasts. Synapse assembly inhibition was in part due to reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and pMHC clustering at the T-cell-bilayer interface, suggesting that N protein interferes with pMHC-TCR interactions. Moreover, N protein colocalized with the TCR independently of pMHC, consistent with a possible interaction with TCR complex components. Based on these data, we conclude that hRSV N protein expression at the surface of infected cells inhibits T-cell activation.
