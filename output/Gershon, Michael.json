Not only does the bowel secrete 5-HT prodigiously but it also expresses a kaleidoscopic abundance of 5-HT receptors. The larger of two enteric 5-HT stores is mucosal, biosynthetically dependent upon tryptophan hydroxylase1 (TPH1), and located in EC cells. Mechanical stimuli, nutrients, luminal bacteria, and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine are all able to stimulate EC cells. Paracrine actions of 5-HT allow the mucosa to signal to neurons to initiate peristaltic and secretory reflexes as well as to inflammatory cells to promote intestinal inflammation. Endocrine effects of 5-HT allow EC cells to influence distant organs, including bone, liver, and endocrine pancreas. The smaller enteric 5-HT store is biosynthetically dependent upon TPH2 and is located within a small subset of myenteric neurons. 5-HT is responsible for slow excitatory neurotransmission manifested primarily in type II/AH neurons. Importantly, neuronal 5-HT also promotes enteric nervous system (ENS) neurogenesis, both pre- and postnatally, through 5-HT2B and especially 5-HT4 receptors. The early birth of serotonergic neurons allows these cells to function as sculptors of the mature ENS. The inactivation of secreted 5-HT depends on transmembrane transport mediated by a serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4). The importance of SERT in control of 5-HT's function means that pharmacological inhibition of SERT, as well as gain- or loss-of-function mutations in SLC6A4, can exert profound effects on development and function of the ENS. Extra-enteric, TPH1-derived 5-HT from yolk sac and placenta promotes neurogenesis before enteric neurons synthesize 5-HT and contribute to ENS patterning. The impressive multi-functional nature of enteric 5-HT has made the precise identification of individual physiological roles difficult and sometimes controversial.", "Keywords": ["Enteric nervous system (ENS)", "Enteric neurogenesis", "Enteric neuronal development", "Enterochromaffin (EC) cells", "Peristaltic and secretory reflex", "Serotonin transporter (SERT)"], "MeSH terms": ["Enteric Nervous System", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Intestine, Small", "Neurons", "Serotonin", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Gershon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. mdg4@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36468883", "Title": "Varicella Vaccine: a Molecular Variant That May Contribute to Attenuation.", "Abstract": "Varicella was troublesome when varicella vaccine (vOka) was licensed in the United States.

No VZV DNA was detected at either site in the saliva of women during the first trimester; however, VZV DNA was detected in the majority of samples of saliva (11/12 examined by nested PCR; 7/10 examined by qPCR) during the third trimester.

Although Dclk1-positive cells are present in adult enteric ganglia, their cellular identity and response to acute injury have not been investigated in detail. Here, we reveal the presence of distinct Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like and Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types in adult myenteric ganglia. These ganglionic cells demonstrate distinct patterns of tracing over time yet show a similar expansion in response to elevated serotonergic signaling. Interestingly, Dclk1-tdTom+ glial-like and neuronal cell types appear resistant to acute irradiation injury-mediated cell death. Moreover, Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells show prominent changes in gene expression profiles induced by injury, in contrast to Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types. Finally, subsets of Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells demonstrate prominent overlap with Nestin and p75NTR and strong responses to elevated serotonergic signaling or acute injury.

Hirschsprung disease and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) and pediatric CIPO are examples of congenital defects that impair gastrointestinal motility. In this issue of the JCI, Thuy-Linh Le et al. analyzed eight patients with defects in tissue that arose from the neural crest. The patients carried homozygous or heterozygous variants in ERBB3 or ERBB2, which encode transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptors that bind neuroregulin 1 (NRG1). Notably, the genetic variants resulted in loss of function with decreased expression or aberrant phosphorylation of the ERBB3/ERBB2 receptors.

We have previously shown that CDNF is also expressed in the bowel and that its absence leads to degeneration and autophagy in the enteric nervous system (ENS), particularly in the submucosal plexus. We now demonstrate that enteric CDNF immunoreactivity is restricted to neurons (submucosal\u2009>\u2009myenteric) and is not seen in glia, interstitial cells of Cajal, or smooth muscle. Expression of CDNF, moreover, is essential for the normal development and survival of enteric dopaminergic neurons; thus, expression of the dopaminergic neuronal markers, dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine transporter are deficient in the ileum of Cdnf -/- mice. The normal age-related decline in proportions of submucosal dopaminergic neurons is exacerbated in Cdnf -/- animals. The defect in Cdnf -/- animals is not dopamine-restricted; proportions of other submucosal neurons (NOS-, GABA-, and CGRP-expressing), are also deficient. The deficits in submucosal neurons are reflected functionally in delayed gastric emptying, slowed colonic motility, and prolonged total gastrointestinal transit. CDNF is expressed selectively in isolated enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDC), which also express the dopamine-related transcription factor Foxa2. Addition of CDNF to ENCDC promotes development of dopaminergic neurons; moreover, survival of these neurons becomes CDNF-dependent after exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4. The effects of neither glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) nor serotonin are additive with CDNF. We suggest that CDNF plays a critical role in development and long-term maintenance of dopaminergic and other sets of submucosal neurons.", "Keywords": ["bone morphogenetic protein-4", "dopaminergic neurons", "enteric nervous system", "glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor", "serotonin", "submucosal plexus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Enteric Nervous System", "Gastrointestinal Transit", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alcm\u00e8ne", "Last Name": "Chalazonitis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "ZhiShan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tuan D", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "P\u00e4ivi", "Last Name": "Lindholm", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Mart", "Last Name": "Saarma", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Lindahl", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Gershon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "The Journal of comparative neurology", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "31783118", "Title": "Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor-deficiency leads to degeneration of enteric neurons and altered brain dopamine neuronal function in mice.", "Abstract": "Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is neuroprotective for nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and restores dopaminergic function in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). To understand the role of CDNF in mammals, we generated CDNF knockout mice (Cdnf-/-), which are viable, fertile, and have a normal life-span. Surprisingly, an age-dependent loss of enteric neurons occurs selectively in the submucosal but not in the myenteric plexus. This neuronal loss is a consequence not of increased apoptosis but of neurodegeneration and autophagy. Quantitatively, the neurodegeneration and autophagy found in the submucosal plexus in duodenum, ileum and colon of the Cdnf-/- mouse are much greater than in those of Cdnf+/+ mice. The selective vulnerability of submucosal neurons to the absence of CDNF is reminiscent of the tendency of pathological abnormalities to occur in the submucosal plexus in biopsies of patients with PD. In contrast, the number of substantia nigra dopamine neurons and dopamine and its metabolite concentrations in the striatum are unaltered in Cdnf-/- mice; however, there is an age-dependent deficit in the function of the dopamine system in Cdnf-/- male mice analyzed. This is observed as D-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, aberrant dopamine transporter function, and as increased D-amphetamine-induced dopamine release demonstrating that dopaminergic axon terminal function in the striatum of the Cdnf-/- mouse brain is altered.

An understanding of VZV neurotropism in humans has long been hampered by the lack of an adequate animal model. For example, experimental inoculation of VZV in small animals including guinea pigs and cotton rats results in the infection of ganglia but not a rash. The severe combined immune deficient human (SCID-hu) model allows the study of VZV neurotropism for human neural sub-populations. Simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely resembles both human primary VZV infection and reactivation, with analyses at early times after infection providing valuable information about the extent of viral replication and the host immune responses. Indeed, a critical role for CD4 T-cell immunity during acute SVV infection as well as reactivation has emerged based on studies using RM.

While the etiology of IBS is incompletely understood, prior exposure to gastrointestinal inflammation or psychologic stress is frequently associated with the development of symptoms. Inflammation or stress-induced expression of growth factors or cytokines may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS. Here, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the receptor of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, rearranged during transfection (RET), in experimental models of inflammation and stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity resembling IBS sequelae. In RET-cyan fluorescent protein [(CFP) RetCFP/+] mice, thoracic and lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia were shown to express RET, which colocalized with calcitonin gene-related peptide. To understand the role of RET in visceral nociception, we employed GSK3179106 as a potent, selective, and gut-restricted RET kinase inhibitor. Colonic hyperalgesia, quantified as exaggerated visceromotor response to graded pressures (0-60 mm Hg) of isobaric colorectal distension (CRD), was produced in multiple rat models induced 1) by colonic irritation, 2) following acute colonic inflammation, 3) by adulthood stress, and 4) by early life stress. In all the rat models, RET inhibition with GSK3179106 attenuated the number of abdominal contractions induced by CRD. Our findings identify a role for RET in visceral nociception.

Activation of p38 MAPK signaling networks has been identified in ASD, and p38 MAPK signaling elevates serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) activity, effects mimicked by multiple, hyperfunctional SERT coding variants identified in ASD subjects. Mice expressing the most common of these variants (SERT Ala56) exhibit hyperserotonemia, a biomarker observed in ASD subjects, as well as p38 MAPK-dependent SERT hyperphosphorylation, elevated hippocampal 5-HT clearance, hypersensitivity of CNS 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors, and behavioral and gastrointestinal perturbations reminiscent of ASD. As the \u03b1-isoform of p38 MAPK drives SERT activation, we tested the hypothesis that CNS-penetrant, \u03b1-isoform-specific p38 MAPK inhibitors might normalize SERT Ala56 phenotypes. Strikingly, 1-week treatment of adult SERT Ala56 mice with MW150, a selective p38\u03b1 MAPK inhibitor, normalized hippocampal 5-HT clearance, CNS 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptor sensitivities, social interactions, and colonic motility. Conditional elimination of p38\u03b1 MAPK in 5-HT neurons of SERT Ala56 mice restored 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptor sensitivities as well as social interactions, mirroring effects of MW150.

We tested the hypothesis that signaling molecules, which are endogenous to the bowel, regulate the severity of intestinal and hepatic damage in an established murine NEC model. Specifically, we postulated that mucosal serotonin (5-HT), which is proinflammatory, would exacerbate experimental NEC and that oxytocin (OT), which is present in enteric neurons and is anti-inflammatory, would oppose it. Genetic deletion of the 5-HT transporter (SERT), which increases and prolongs effects of 5-HT, was found to increase the severity of systemic manifestations, intestinal inflammation, and associated hepatotoxicity of experimental NEC. In contrast, genetic deletion of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), which is responsible for 5-HT biosynthesis in enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the intestinal mucosa, and TPH inhibition with LP-920540 both decrease the severity of experimental NEC in the small intestine and liver. These observations suggest that 5-HT from EC cells helps to drive the inflammatory damage to the gut and liver that occurs in the murine NEC model. Administration of OT decreased, while the OT receptor antagonist atosiban exacerbated, the intestinal inflammation of experimental NEC. Data from the current investigation are consistent with the tested hypotheses-that the enteric signaling molecules, 5-HT (positively) and OT (negatively) regulate severity of inflammation in a mouse model of NEC. Moreover, we suggest that mucosally restricted inhibition of 5-HT biosynthesis and/or administration of OT may be useful in the treatment of NEC.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Serotonin (5-HT) and oxytocin reciprocally regulate the severity of intestinal inflammation and hepatotoxicity in a murine model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Selective depletion of mucosal 5-HT through genetic deletion or inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 ameliorates, while deletion of the 5-HT uptake transporter, which increases 5-HT availability, exacerbates the severity of NEC.

Multiple, rare hyperfunctional coding variants of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT, encoded by SLC6A4) have been identified in ASD. Expression of the most common SERT variant (Ala56) in mice increases 5-HT clearance and causes ASD-like behaviors. Here, we demonstrated that Ala56-expressing mice display GI defects that resemble those seen in mice lacking neuronal 5-HT. These defects included enteric nervous system hypoplasia, slow GI transit, diminished peristaltic reflex activity, and proliferation of crypt epithelial cells. An opposite phenotype was seen in SERT-deficient mice and in progeny of WT dams given the SERT antagonist fluoxetine. The reciprocal phenotypes that resulted from increased or decreased SERT activity support the idea that 5-HT signaling regulates enteric neuronal development and can, when disturbed, cause long-lasting abnormalities of GI function. Administration of a 5-HT4 agonist to Ala56 mice during development prevented Ala56-associated GI perturbations, suggesting that excessive SERT activity leads to inadequate 5-HT4-mediated neurogenesis. We propose that deficient 5-HT signaling during development may contribute to GI and behavioral features of ASD.

The ENS has been called the 'second brain' given its autonomy, remarkable neurotransmitter diversity and complex cytoarchitecture. Defects in ENS development are responsible for many human disorders including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). HSCR is caused by the developmental failure of ENS progenitors to migrate into the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the distal colon. Human ENS development remains poorly understood owing to the lack of an easily accessible model system. Here we demonstrate the efficient derivation and isolation of ENS progenitors from human pluripotent stem (PS) cells, and their further differentiation into functional enteric neurons. ENS precursors derived in vitro are capable of targeted migration in the developing chick embryo and extensive colonization of the adult mouse colon. The in vivo engraftment and migration of human PS-cell-derived ENS precursors rescue disease-related mortality in HSCR mice (Ednrb(s-l/s-l)), although the mechanism of action remains unclear. Finally, EDNRB-null mutant ENS precursors enable modelling of HSCR-related migration defects, and the identification of pepstatin A as a candidate therapeutic target.

Growing evidence for the essential role of enteric glia in bowel function makes it imperative to understand better their molecular marker expression and how they relate to glia in the rest of the nervous system. We analyzed expression of markers of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ENS and found, unexpectedly, that proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) is specifically expressed by glia in adult mouse intestine. PLP1 and S100\u03b2 are the markers most widely expressed by enteric glia, while glial fibrillary acidic protein expression is more restricted. Marker expression in addition to cellular location and morphology distinguishes a specific subpopulation of intramuscular enteric glia, suggesting that a combinatorial code of molecular markers can be used to identify distinct subtypes. To assess the similarity between enteric and extraenteric glia, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on PLP1-expressing cells in the mouse intestine and compared their gene expression pattern to that of other types of glia. This analysis shows that enteric glia are transcriptionally unique and distinct from other cell types in the nervous system.

Primary infection is followed by latency in ganglionic neurons. During this period, no virus particles are produced and no obvious neuronal damage occurs. Reactivation of the virus leads to virus replication, which causes zoster (shingles) in tissues innervated by the involved neurons, inflammation and cell death - a process that can lead to persistent radicular pain (postherpetic neuralgia). The pathogenesis of postherpetic neuralgia is unknown and it is difficult to treat. Furthermore, other zoster complications can develop, including myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, stroke (vasculopathy), retinitis, and gastroenterological infections such as ulcers, pancreatitis and hepatitis. VZV is the only human herpesvirus for which highly effective vaccines are available. After varicella or vaccination, both wild-type and vaccine-type VZV establish latency, and long-term immunity to varicella develops. However, immunity does not protect against reactivation. Thus, two vaccines are used: one to prevent varicella and one to prevent zoster.

His medical history provides a cautionary lens through which to view the decision of when vaccination is appropriate. A middle-aged man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma received chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. He was vaccinated 4 years post-transplantation, despite diagnosis of a new low-grade lymphoma confined to the lymph nodes. Within 3 months of vaccination, he developed recurrent rashes with fever, malaise, weakness, hepatitis, weight loss, and renal failure. The syndrome was eventually determined to be associated with persistent disseminated zoster caused by the vaccine virus.

regulated OT receptors (OTRs). Although OT (with secretin) opposes intestinal inflammation, physiological roles played by enteric OT/OTR signaling have not previously been determined. We tested hypotheses that OT/OTR signaling contributes to enteric nervous system (ENS)-related gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. GI functions and OT effects were compared in OTR-knockout (OTRKO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Stool mass and water content were greater in OTRKO mice than in WT. GI transit time in OTRKO animals was faster than in WT; OT inhibited in vitro generation of ENS-dependent colonic migrating motor complexes in WT but not in OTRKO mice. Myenteric neurons were hyperplastic in OTRKO animals, and mucosal exposure to cholera toxin (CTX) in vitro activated Fos in more myenteric neurons in OTRKO than WT than in WT mice; OT inhibited the CTX response in WT but not in OTRKO mice. Villi and crypts were shorter in OTRKO than in WT mice, and transit-amplifying cell proliferation in OTRKO crypts was deficient. Macromolecular intestinal permeability in OTRKO was greater than WT mice, and experimental colitis was more severe in OTRKO mice; moreover, OT protected WT animals from colitis. Observations suggest that OT/OTR signaling acts as a brake on intestinal motility, decreases mucosal activation of enteric neurons, and promotes enteric neuronal development and/or survival. It also regulates proliferation of crypt cells and mucosal permeability; moreover OT/OTR signaling is protective against inflammation.

In three separate mouse models of gastric cancer, surgical or pharmacological denervation of the stomach (bilateral or unilateral truncal vagotomy, or local injection of botulinum toxin type A) markedly reduced tumor incidence and progression, but only in the denervated portion of the stomach. Vagotomy or botulinum toxin type A treatment also enhanced the therapeutic effects of systemic chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Denervation-induced suppression of tumorigenesis was associated with inhibition of Wnt signaling and suppression of stem cell expansion. In gastric organoid cultures, neurons stimulated growth in a Wnt-mediated fashion through cholinergic signaling. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout of the muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor suppressed gastric tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer patients, tumor stage correlated with neural density and activated Wnt signaling, whereas vagotomy reduced the risk of gastric cancer.

It is tightly regulated by complex cellular interactions; however, our understanding of these controls is incomplete. A distinct population of macrophages is distributed in the intestinal muscularis externa. We demonstrate that, in the steady state, muscularis macrophages regulate peristaltic activity of the colon. They change the pattern of smooth muscle contractions by secreting bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which activates BMP receptor (BMPR) expressed by enteric neurons. Enteric neurons, in turn, secrete colony stimulatory factor 1 (CSF1), a growth factor required for macrophage development.

Our findings identify a plastic, microbiota-driven crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons that controls gastrointestinal motility.

VZV also infects guinea pig enteric neurons in vitro, establishes latency and can be reactivated. We therefore determined whether lymphocytes infected in vitro with VZV secrete infectious virions and can transfer infection in vivo to the ENS of recipient guinea pigs. T lymphocytes (CD3-immunoreactive) were preferentially infected following co-culture of guinea pig or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with VZV-infected HELF. VZV proliferated in the infected T cells and expressed immediate early and late VZV genes. Electron microscopy confirmed that VZV-infected T cells produced encapsulated virions. Extracellular virus, however, was pleomorphic, suggesting degradation occurred prior to release, which was confirmed by the failure of VZV-infected T cells to secrete infectious virions. Intravenous injection of WT- or vOka-infected PBMCs, nevertheless, transmitted VZV to recipient animals (guinea pig\u2009>\u2009human lymphocytes). Two days post-inoculation, lung and liver, but not gut, contained DNA and transcripts encoding ORFs 4, 40, 66 and 67. Twenty-eight days after infection, gut contained DNA and transcripts encoding ORFs 4 and 66 but neither DNA nor transcripts could any longer be found in lung or liver. In situ hybridization revealed VZV DNA in enteric neurons, which also expressed ORF63p (but not ORF68p) immunoreactivity. Observations suggest that VZV infects T cells, which can transfer VZV to and establish latency in enteric neurons in vivo.

DCLK1\u207a tuft cells are increased in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis; however, the role of these cells within the gastrointestinal epithelium and their potential as cancer-initiating cells are poorly understood. Here, using a BAC-CreERT-dependent genetic lineage-tracing strategy, we determined that a subpopulation of DCLK1\u207a cells is extremely long lived and possesses rare stem cell abilities. Moreover, genetic ablation of Dclk1 revealed that DCLK1\u207a tuft cells contribute to recovery following intestinal and colonic injury. Surprisingly, conditional knockdown of the Wnt regulator APC in DCLK1\u207a cells was not sufficient to drive colonic carcinogenesis under normal conditions; however, dextran sodium sulfate-induced (DSS-induced) colitis promoted the development of poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma in mice lacking APC in DCLK1\u207a cells. Importantly, colonic tumor formation occurred even when colitis onset was delayed for up to 3 months after induced APC loss in DCLK1\u207a cells. Thus, our data define an intestinal DCLK1\u207a tuft cell population that is long lived, quiescent, and important for intestinal homeostasis and regeneration.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that the secretion of 5-HT from mucosal enterochromaffin (EC) cells is essential for the manifestation of murine colonic peristaltic reflexes. To do so, we analysed the mechanisms underlying faecal pellet propulsion in isolated colons of mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1(-/-) mice), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of mucosal but not neuronal 5-HT. We used video analysis of faecal pellet propulsion, tension transducers to record colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) and intracellular microelectrodes to record circular muscle activity occurring spontaneously or following intraluminal distension. When compared with control (Tph1(+/+)) mice, Tph1(-/-) animals exhibited: (1) an elongated colon; (2) larger faecal pellets; (3) orthograde propulsion followed by retropulsion (not observed in Tph1(+/+) colon); (4) slower in vitro propulsion of larger faecal pellets (28% of Tph1(+/+)); (5) CMMCs that infrequently propagated in an oral to anal direction because of impaired descending inhibition; (6) reduced CMMCs and inhibitory responses to intraluminal balloon distension; (7) an absence of reflex activity in response to mucosal stimulation. In addition, (8) thin pellets that propagated along the control colon failed to do so in Tph1(-/-) colon; and (9) the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, which reduced CMMCs and blocked their propagation in Tph1(+/+) mice, failed to alter CMMCs in Tph1(-/-) animals.
