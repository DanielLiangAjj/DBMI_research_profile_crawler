This designation is typically arrived at by administering a full cognitive battery and assigning a cutoff (e.g., 4 of 11 tests failed) to distinguish impaired/non-impaired. This relatively coarse approach yields a heterogeneous group of \"impaired\" patients, some of whom may have isolated memory or PS deficits, others with combined deficits.

We examined FC from fMRI collected during rest in the DN of 43 MS patients with and without memory-impairment. Memory-intact patients showed increased DN FC relative to memory-impaired patients. There were no regions of higher FC in memory-impaired patients. DN FC was positively correlated with memory function, such that higher FC was associated with better memory performance. Results were unchanged after controlling for cognitive efficiency, supporting specificity of the DN to memory and not cognitive status more generally.

Regression analyses examined the impact of brain atrophy on (a) initial learning and delayed retrieval separately, and then (b) delayed retrieval controlling for initial learning. Brain atrophy was negatively associated with both initial learning and delayed retrieval (ps < 0.01), but brain atrophy was unrelated to retrieval when controlling for initial learning (p > 0.05). In addition, brain atrophy was associated with inefficient learning across initial acquisition trials, and brain atrophy was unrelated to delayed recall among MS subjects who successfully acquired the word list (although such learning frequently required many exposures).
