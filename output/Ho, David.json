Currently, there is no H7N9-specific prevention or treatment for humans. Here, from a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case in Hong Kong, we isolate four hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), with three directed to the globular head domain (HA1) and one to the stalk domain (HA2). Two clonally related HA1-directed mAbs, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, potently neutralize H7N9 and protect female mice from lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge. Cryo-EM structures reveal that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bind to a \u03b214-centered surface and disrupt the 220-loop that makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid on an adjacent protomer, thereby blocking viral entry. Sequence analysis indicates the lateral patch targeted by H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to be conserved among influenza subtypes. Both H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 retain HA1 binding and neutralization capacity to later H7N9 isolates from 2016-2017, consistent with structural data showing that the antigenic mutations during this timeframe occur at their epitope peripheries. The HA2-directed mAb H7.HK4 lacks neutralizing activity but when used in combination with H7.HK2 moderately augments female mouse protection.

Here, we report inhibitory peptides against SARS-CoV-2 E protein named iPep-SARS2-E. Leveraging E-induced alterations in proton homeostasis and NFAT/AP-1 pathway in mammalian cells, we developed screening platforms to design and optimize the peptides that bind and inhibit E protein. Using Vero-E6 cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived branching lung organoid and mouse models with SARS-CoV-2, we found that iPep-SARS2-E significantly inhibits virus egress and reduces viral cytotoxicity and propagation in vitro and in vivo.

One phenotypic group exhibited a discernible decrease in viral receptor affinities, but a noteworthy increase in resistance to antibody neutralization, as exemplified by CH.1.1, which is apparently as resistant as XBB.1.5. In contrast, a second group demonstrated a substantial increase in viral receptor affinity but only a moderate increase in antibody evasion, as exemplified by BN.1.

Currently there is no H7N9-specific prevention or treatment for humans. From a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case occurred in Hong Kong, we isolated four H7 hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by single B cell cloning, with three mAbs directed to the HA globular head domain (HA1) and one to the HA stem region (HA2). Two clonally related HA1-directed mAbs, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, potently neutralized H7N9 and protected mice from a lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge. Cryo-EM structures revealed that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bind to a \u03b214-centered surface partially overlapping with the antigenic site D of HA1 and disrupt the 220-loop that makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid on the adjacent protomer, thus affectively blocking viral entry. The more potent mAb H7.HK2 retained full HA1 binding and neutralization capacity to later H7N9 isolates from 2016-2017, which is consistent with structural data showing that the antigenic mutations of 2016-2017 from the 2013 H7N9 only occurred at the periphery of the mAb epitope. The HA2-directed mAb H7.HK4 lacked neutralizing activity but protected mice from the lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge when engineered to mouse IgG2a enabling Fc effector function in mice. Used in combination with H7.HK2 at a suboptimal dose, H7.HK4 augmented mouse protection.

Bivalent boosters do not show notably higher binding or virus-neutralizing titers against various SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to monovalent ones. However, breakthrough infections lead to significantly better neutralization of Omicron subvariants.

Reassuringly, BA.2.86 was no more resistant to human sera than the currently dominant XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1, indicating that the new subvariant would not have a growth advantage in this regard. Importantly, sera from people who had XBB breakthrough infection exhibited robust neutralizing activity against all viruses tested, suggesting that upcoming XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines could confer added protection.

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics of first vs. second infections in this group, adjusting for viral variant, vaccination status, and age. Relative to first infections, second infections usually featured a faster clearance time. Furthermore, a person's relative (rank-order) viral clearance time, compared to others infected with the same variant, was roughly conserved across first and second infections, so that individuals who had a relatively fast clearance time in their first infection also tended to have a relatively fast clearance time in their second infection (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.30, 95% credible interval (0.12, 0.46)). These findings provide evidence that, like vaccination, immunity from a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection shortens the duration of subsequent acute SARS-CoV-2 infections principally by reducing viral clearance time.

As an RNA virus characterized by high mutation rates, whether SARS-CoV-2 will develop resistance to nirmatrelvir is a question of concern. Our previous studies have shown that several mutational pathways confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, but some result in a loss of viral replicative fitness, which is then compensated\u00a0for by additional alterations3. The molecular mechanisms for this observed resistance are\u00a0unknown. Here we combined biochemical and structural methods to demonstrate that alterations at the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro can allow SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance to nirmatrelvir in two distinct ways. Comprehensive studies of the\u00a0structures of\u00a014 Mpro mutants\u00a0in complex with drugs or substrate revealed that alterations at the S1 and S4 subsites substantially decreased\u00a0the level of inhibitor binding, whereas alterations at the S2 and S4' subsites unexpectedly increased protease activity. Both mechanisms contributed to nirmatrelvir resistance, with\u00a0the latter compensating for the loss in enzymatic activity of the former, which in turn accounted for the restoration of viral replicative fitness, as observed previously3. Such a profile was also observed for ensitrelvir, another clinically relevant Mpro inhibitor. These results shed light on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evolves to develop resistance to the current generation of protease inhibitors and provide the basis for the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antiviral Agents", "COVID-19", "Lactams", "Leucine", "Nitriles", "SARS-CoV-2", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Binding Sites", "Mutation",

We also found that this protective antiviral effect is both host-directed and mechanism-specific, requiring both the CD1d molecule and interferon-[Formula: see text].

Many knowledge-based (KB) computational approaches have been developed to predict beneficial mutations, but their accuracy leaves room for improvement. Thermodynamic integration (TI) is an alchemical free energy algorithm that offers an alternative technique for identifying beneficial mutations, but its performance has not been evaluated. In this study, we developed an efficient TI protocol with high accuracy for predicting binding free energy changes of antibody mutations. The improved TI method outperforms KB methods at identifying both beneficial and deleterious mutations. We observed that KB methods have higher accuracies in predicting deleterious mutations than beneficial mutations. A pipeline using KB methods to efficiently exclude deleterious mutations and TI to accurately identify beneficial mutations was developed for high-throughput mutation scanning. The pipeline was applied to optimize the binding affinity of a broadly sarbecovirus neutralizing antibody 10-40 against the circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant. Three identified beneficial mutations show strong synergy and improve both binding affinity and neutralization potency of antibody 10-40.

However, because SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities3-9, there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here we examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both and their sequences showed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment peformed with many replicates, 53\u2009independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23\u2009different residues of the enzyme. Nevertheless, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13\u2009recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones showed that these mutations mediated only low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (around 100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I.

Here we describe a new deep mutational scanning platform based on non-replicative pseudotyped lentiviruses that directly quantifies how large numbers of spike mutations impact antibody neutralization and pseudovirus infection. We demonstrate this new platform by making libraries of the Omicron BA.1 and Delta spikes. These libraries each contain ~7000 distinct amino-acid mutations in the context of up to ~135,000 unique mutation combinations.

Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. IMPORTANCE The neutralizing capacities of monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 and of those recovered from previously infected and vaccinated individuals against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) remain important questions. We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. We note high attack rates with symptoms in nearly 50% of infected individuals, in sharp contrast to an unrelated institutional outbreak caused by the R.1 variant among a vaccinated population. We found little evidence of significant community spillover. This variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and dampened the neutralization capacity of convalescent-phase plasma from individuals with previous infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. Among three vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs.

B.1.1.529 and B.1.617.2\u00a0S glycoproteins bind ACE2 with higher affinity than D614G S. The unliganded B.1.1.529\u00a0S trimer is less stable at low temperatures than the other SARS-CoV-2 Ss, a property related to its more \"open\" S conformation. Upon ACE2 binding, the B.1.1.529\u00a0S trimer sheds S1 at 37\u00b0C, but not at 0\u00b0C. B.1.1.529 pseudoviruses are relatively resistant to neutralization by sera from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccinees. These properties of the B.1.1.529\u00a0S glycoprotein likely influence the transmission, cytopathic effects, and immune evasion of this emerging variant.", "Keywords": ["ACE2 affinity", "B.1.1.529", "B.1.617.2", "CP: Immunology", "CP: Microbiology", "Omicron", "S1 shedding", "SARS-CoV-2", "neutralization sensitivity", "stability", "variants"], "MeSH terms": ["Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2", "COVID-19", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

To address future zoonotic outbreaks due to related viruses in the sarbecovirus subgenus, we identified a human monoclonal antibody, 10-40, that neutralized or bound all sarbecoviruses tested in vitro and protected against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in vivo. Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses, suggesting that 10-40 is a promising agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses but also uncovered a distinct antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif. Our analyses also suggested that elicitation of this class of antibodies may not be overly difficult, an observation that bodes well for the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.", "Keywords":

molecule COVID-19 therapy, given its likely druggability and essentiality in the viral maturation and replication cycle.

After evaluation of their binding specificity, cellular antiviral potency, metabolic stability, and water solubility, we prioritized the GC376 scaffold as being optimal for optimization. We identified multiple drug-like compounds with <10\u2009nM potency for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 3CL and the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells, obtained co-crystal structures of the 3CL protease in complex with these compounds, and determined that they have pan-coronavirus activity.

We2 and others3-6 recently reported results confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of the evolution of Omicron has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K alteration (BA.1+R346K, also known as BA.1.1) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike alterations and lacking 13 spike alterations found in BA.1. Here we extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.1 (refs. 2,3,5,6). These findings indicate that these three sublineages of Omicron are antigenically equidistant from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and thus similarly threaten the efficacies of current vaccines. BA.2 also exhibited marked resistance to 17 of 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested, including S309 (sotrovimab)7, which had retained appreciable activity against BA.1 and BA.1+R346K (refs. 2-4,6). This finding shows that no authorized monoclonal antibody therapy could adequately cover all sublineages of the Omicron variant, except for the recently authorized LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jasper F-W", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Yiming", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maple", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hin", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Kenn K-H", "Last Name": "Chik", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Terrence T-T", "Last Name": "Yuen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena E", "Last Name": "Sobieszczyk", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwok-Yung", "Last Name": "Yuen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. dh2994@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "35172173", "Title": "Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike.", "Abstract": "The recently reported B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) includes 34 mutations in the spike protein relative to the Wuhan strain, including 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

It is expected to become dominant in the coming weeks2, probably due to enhanced transmissibility. A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings of our study. Here we found that B.1.1.529 is markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals who were vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from individuals who were vaccinated and received a booster dose of mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies against all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 out of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones that are currently authorized or approved for use in patients. Moreover, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance on B.1.1.529. The Omicron variant presents a serious threat to many existing COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, compelling the development of new interventions that anticipate the evolutionary trajectory of

This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and fit them to data to estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking viral load (VL) to infectiousness and show a person's infectiousness increases sublinearly with VL and that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and RT-PCR tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2", "SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness", "viral kinetics"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing", "False Positive Reactions", "Humans", "Kinetics", "SARS-CoV-2", "Serologic Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruian", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545."}, {"First Name": "Carolin", "Last Name": "Zitzmann", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ruy M", "Last Name": "Ribeiro", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545."}, {"First Name": "Alan S", "Last Name": "Perelson", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545; asp@lanl.gov."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Dec07"}, {"PMID": "34850919", "Title": "Comments on 'An airway organoid-based screen identifies a role for the HIF1\u03b1\u2012glycolysis axis in SARS-CoV-2 infection'.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Cells, Cultured", "Glycolysis", "Humans", "Organoids", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaohua", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Ave., New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Center for Single-Cell Omics, School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Ave., New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Todd", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Ave., New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shuibing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Ave., New York, NY 10065, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of molecular cell biology", "PubDate": "2022Feb24"}, {"PMID": "34836485", "Title": "A monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV, and other sarbecoviruses.", "Abstract": "The repeated emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses as well as their evolving variants highlight the need to develop potent and broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant5), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are\u00a0likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526.

The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient's infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time.

Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking VL to infectiousness, showing that a person's infectiousness increases sub-linearly with VL. We show that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost, but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruian", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carolin", "Last Name": "Zitzmann", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ruy M", "Last Name": "Ribeiro", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan S", "Last Name": "Perelson", "Affiliation": "Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2021Jun30"}, {"PMID": "34111408", "Title": "Structural basis for accommodation of emerging B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants by two potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "Emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, from the UK and South Africa, respectively, show decreased neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent or vaccinee sera raised against the original wild-type virus, and are thus of clinical concern.

Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group\u00a01 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group\u00a02 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group\u00a02 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and-to our knowledge-rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

nervous system dysfunction4. However, which neural cells are permissive to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been controversial. Here, we show that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are selectively permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a DA neuron inflammatory and cellular senescence response. A high-throughput screen in hPSC-derived DA neurons identified several FDA approved drugs, including riluzole, metformin, and imatinib, that can rescue the cellular senescence phenotype and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA-seq analysis of human ventral midbrain tissue from COVID-19 patients, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy samples, confirmed the induction of an inflammatory and cellular senescence signature and identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Our findings demonstrate that hPSC-derived DA neurons can serve as a disease model to study neuronal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and to identify candidate neuroprotective drugs for COVID-19 patients. The susceptibility of hPSC-derived DA neurons to SARS-CoV-2 and the observed inflammatory and senescence transcriptional responses suggest the need for careful, long-term monitoring of neurological

This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identified compounds with broad 3CLpro-inhibitory activity. We also adapted the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncovered additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CLpro inhibitors. We observed strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live-virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identified two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested, including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last 2 decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We developed and validated a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identified compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncovered structural insights into features that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.", "Keywords": ["3CL protease", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "antiviral drugs", "cell-based assay", "coronavirus", "protease inhibitors", "protease-mediated cytotoxicity", "zoonotic coronaviruses"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Coronavirus 3C Proteases", "Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel J", "Last Name": "Resnick", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seo Jung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arie", "Last Name": "Zask", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hengrui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Schuyler", "Last Name": "Melore", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang-Yu", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "WuXi AppTec, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manoj S", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sumin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E S", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomislav", "Last Name": "Rovis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "WuXi AppTec, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2021Jun24"}, {"PMID": "33887205", "Title": "Increased resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 to antibody neutralization.", "Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about altered sensitivity to antibody-mediated immunity.

The magnitude of resistance is greater for monoclonal antibodies than vaccinee sera and evident with both pseudovirus and authentic P.1 virus. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals that the P.1 trimer adopts exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the \"up\" position, which is known to facilitate binding to entry receptor ACE2.

Here, we report the emergence of variant lineage B.1.526 that contains E484K and its alarming rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and less susceptible to neutralization by convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The B.1.526 lineage has now been reported from all 50 states in the US and numerous other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York upon its emergence, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. Such transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, likely contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526.

In the Golgi, the gp160 Env precursor is modified by complex sugars and proteolytically cleaved to produce the mature functional Env trimer, which resists antibody neutralization. We observed mostly uncleaved gp160 and smaller amounts of cleaved gp120 and gp41 Envs on the surface of HIV-1-infected or Env-expressing cells; however, cleaved Envs were relatively enriched in virions and virus-like particles (VLPs). This relative enrichment of cleaved Env in VLPs was observed for wild-type Envs, for Envs lacking the cytoplasmic tail, and for CD4-independent, conformationally flexible Envs. On the cell surface, we identified three distinct populations of Envs: (i) the cleaved Env was transported through the Golgi, was modified by complex glycans, formed trimers that cross-linked efficiently, and was recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies; (ii) a small fraction of Env modified by complex carbohydrates escaped cleavage in the Golgi; and (iii) the larger population of uncleaved Env lacked complex carbohydrates, cross-linked into diverse oligomeric forms, and was recognized by poorly neutralizing antibodies. This last group of more \"open\" Env oligomers reached the cell surface in the presence of brefeldin A, apparently bypassing the Golgi apparatus. Relative to Envs transported through the Golgi, these uncleaved Envs were counterselected for virion incorporation. By employing two pathways for Env transport to the surface of infected cells, HIV-1 can misdirect host antibody responses toward conformationally flexible, uncleaved Env without compromising virus infectivity.IMPORTANCE The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mediate the entry of the virus into host cells and serve as targets for neutralizing antibodies. The cleaved, functional Env is incorporated into virus particles from the surface of the infected cell. We found that an uncleaved form of Env is transported to the cell surface by an unconventional route, but this nonfunctional Env is mostly excluded from the virus. Thus, only one of the pathways by which Env is transported to the surface of infected cells results in efficient incorporation into virus particles, potentially allowing the uncleaved Env to act as a decoy to the host immune system without compromising virus infectivity.", "Keywords": ["Env", "Golgi bypass", "antibody", "cell surface", "cleavage", "trafficking", "virion incorporation"], "MeSH terms": ["A549 Cells", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Transport", "Virion", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shijian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanh T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haitao", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shitao", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagellos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debjani", "Last Name": "Guha", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dana", "Last Name": "Gabuzda", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagellos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Kappes", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Sodroski", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA joseph_sodroski@dfci.harvard.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2021Jan13"}, {"PMID": "33116299", "Title": "Identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using lung and colonic organoids.", "Abstract": "There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs\u00a0(particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the\u00a0FDA\u00a0(US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride.

We identify the source of 10E8 heterogeneity being linked to cis/trans isomerization at two prolines within the YPP motif in the CRD3 loop that exists as two predominant conformers that interconvert on a slow timescale. The YtransP conformation conformer can bind the HIV gp41 epitope, while the YcisP is not binding competent and shows a higher aggregation propensity. The high barrier of isomerization and propensity to adopt non-binding competent proline conformers provides novel insight into the slow binding kinetics, low potency, and poor solubility of 10E8.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the interactions among SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells, macrophage, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby offering important insights into new therapeutic strategies. Here, we used directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to establish a lung and macrophage co-culture system and model the host-pathogen interaction and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the hPSC-derived lung cells, alveolar type II and ciliated cells are the major cell populations expressing the viral receptor ACE2 and co-effector TMPRSS2, and both were highly permissive to viral infection. We found that alternatively polarized macrophages (M2) and classically polarized macrophages (M1) had similar inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, only M1 macrophages significantly up-regulated inflammatory factors including IL-6 and IL-18, inhibiting growth and enhancing apoptosis of lung cells. Inhibiting viral entry into target cells using an ACE2 blocking antibody enhanced the activity of M2 macrophages, resulting in nearly complete clearance of virus and protection of lung cells. These results suggest a potential therapeutic strategy, in that by blocking viral entrance to target cells while boosting anti-inflammatory action of macrophages at an early stage of infection, M2 macrophages can eliminate SARS-CoV-2, while sparing lung cells and suppressing the dysfunctional hyper-inflammatory response mediated by M1 macrophages.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Human pluripotent stem cell", "Macrophages", "SARS-CoV-2", "disease modeling"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fuyu", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University."}, {"First Name": "Liyan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Prenatal Diagnostic Centre and Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Liuliu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yuling", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Abhimanyu", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "The Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, the University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin E", "Last Name": "Nilsson-Payant", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Zhao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the University of Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Chui", "Last Name": "Yan Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the University of Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoya", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Prenatal Diagnostic Centre and Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Cent."}, {"First Name": "Teng", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Tuo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Genomic Resource Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Genomic Resource Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Genomic Resource Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohua", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Genomic Resource Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Hung-Fat", "Last Name": "Tse", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the University of Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Can", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Prenatal Diagnostic Centre and Cord Blood Bank, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Weiren", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology."}, {"First Name": "Fang-Ping", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Shenzhen University."}, {"First Name": "Ya-Wen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Hastings Center for Pulmonary Research, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Todd", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "tenOever", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."}, {"First Name": "Shuibing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Na", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University."}, {"First Name": "Qizhou", "Last Name": "Lian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the University of Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Huanhuan Joyce", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "The Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, the University of Chicago."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2020Sep15"}, {"PMID": "32793898", "Title": "Lead compounds for the development of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors.", "Abstract": "We report the identification of three structurally diverse compounds - compound 4, GC376, and MAC-5576 - as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease.

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to &gt;5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9\u00a0ng\u00a0ml-1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

mediate virus neutralization, whereas Fc engagement of Fc-\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) could mediate an array of effector functions. Evidence abounds that effector functions are important in controlling infections by influenza, Ebola, or HIV-1 in animal models. However, the relative contribution of virus neutralization versus effector functions to the overall antiviral activity of an antibody remains unknown. To address this fundamental question in immunology, we utilized our knowledge of HIV-1 dynamics to compare the kinetics of the viral load decline (\u0394VL) in infected animals given a wild-type (WT) anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) versus those given a Fc-Null variant of the same antibody. In three independent experiments in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and one pivotal experiment in simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, an earlier and sharper decline in viral load was consistently detected for the WT antibody. Quantifications of the observed differences indicate that Fc-mediated effector functions accounted for 25-45% of the total antiviral activity in these separate experiments.

would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

How high these numbers will eventually go depends on many factors, including policies on travel and movement, availability of medical support, and, because there is no vaccine or highly effective treatment, the pace of biomedical research. Other than an approved antiviral drug that can be repurposed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold the most promise for providing a stopgap measure to lessen the impact of an outbreak while vaccines are in development. Technical advances in mAb identification, combined with the flexibility and clinical experience of mAbs in general, make them ideal candidates for rapid deployment. Furthermore, the development of mAb cocktails can provide a faster route to developing a robust medical intervention than searching for a single, outstanding mAb. In addition, mAbs are well-suited for integration into platform technologies for delivery, in which minimal components need to be changed in order to be redirected against a novel pathogen.

This screen identified IWS1, POLE3, POLR1B, PSMD1, and TGM2 as potential regulators of HIV-1 latency, of which PSMD1 and TMG2 could be confirmed pharmacologically. Further investigation of PSMD1 revealed that an interacting enzyme, the deubiquitinase UCH37, was also involved in HIV-1 latency. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the deubiquitinase family by gene knockout, identifying several deubiquitinases, UCH37, USP14, OTULIN, and USP5 as possible HIV-1 latency regulators. A specific inhibitor of USP14, IU1, reversed HIV-1 latency and displayed synergistic effects with other latency reversal agents. IU1 caused degradation of TDP-43, a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Collectively, this study is the first comprehensive evaluation of deubiquitinases in HIV-1 latency and establishes that they may hold a critical role.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["CRISPR-Cas Systems", "DNA Polymerase III", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases", "Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD", "Deubiquitinating Enzymes", "Endopeptidases", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "HIV-1", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Nucleoproteins", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase", "Virus Latency"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anurag", "Last Name": "Rathore", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manxue", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Sahi", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. dh2994@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Mar24"}]
