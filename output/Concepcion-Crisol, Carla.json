[{"PMID": "34561242", "Title": "Smarca4 Inactivation Promotes Lineage-Specific Transformation and Early Metastatic Features in the Lung.", "Abstract": "SMARCA4/BRG1 encodes for one of two mutually exclusive ATPases present in mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes and is frequently mutated in human lung adenocarcinoma. However, the functional consequences of SMARCA4 mutation on tumor initiation, progression, and chromatin regulation in lung cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Smarca4 sensitizes club cell secretory protein-positive cells within the lung in a cell type-dependent fashion to malignant transformation and tumor progression, resulting in highly advanced dedifferentiated tumors and increased metastatic incidence. Consistent with these phenotypes, Smarca4-deficient primary tumors lack lung lineage transcription factor activities and resemble a metastatic cell state. Mechanistically, we show that Smarca4 loss impairs the function of all three classes of SWI/SNF complexes, resulting in decreased chromatin accessibility at lung lineage motifs and ultimately accelerating tumor progression. Thus, we propose that the SWI/SNF complex via Smarca4 acts as a gatekeeper for lineage-specific cellular transformation and metastasis during lung cancer evolution. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate cell-type specificity in the tumor-suppressive functions of SMARCA4 in the lung, pointing toward a critical role of the cell-of-origin in driving SWI/SNF-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We further show the direct effects of SMARCA4 loss on SWI/SNF function and chromatin regulation that cause aggressive malignancy during lung cancer evolution.This article is highlighted in the In This

There are no targeted therapies for this subset of lung cancers, nor is it known how mutations in BRG1 contribute to lung cancer progression. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that deletion of BRG1 in lung cancer leads to activation of replication stress responses. Single-molecule assessment of replication fork dynamics in BRG1-deficient cells revealed increased origin firing mediated by the prelicensing protein, CDC6. Quantitative mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complexes interact with RPA complexes. Finally, BRG1-deficient lung cancers were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of ATR. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into BRG1-mutant lung cancers and suggest that their dependency on ATR can be leveraged therapeutically and potentially expanded to BRG1-mutant cancers in other tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that inhibition of ATR is a promising therapy for the 10% of non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring mutations in SMARCA4/BRG1.

A recently discovered example is a fusion between the genes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), generated by an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2: inv(2)(p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Despite their importance, modelling such genetic events in mice has proven challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germ line. Here we describe an efficient method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumours invariably harbour the Eml4-Alk inversion, express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histopathological and molecular features typical of ALK(+) human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK inhibitors. The general strategy described here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other organisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "CRISPR-Associated Proteins", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Cells, Cultured", "Chromosome Inversion", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Crizotinib", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Engineering", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrazoles", "Pyridines", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Translocation, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danilo", "Last Name": "Maddalo", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eusebio", "Last Name": "Manchado", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carla P", "Last Name": "Concepcion", "Affiliation": "1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ciro", "Last Name": "Bonetti", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joana A", "Last Name": "Vidigal", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoon-Chi", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Ogrodowski", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Crippa", "Affiliation": "Milano-Bicocca University, Department of Medical Oncology, San Gerardo Hospital, 20052, Via G B Pergolesi 33, Monza, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Natasha", "Last Name": "Rekhtman", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Thoracic Pathology and Cytopathology, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "de Stanchina", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Molecular Pharmacology Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott W", "Last Name": "Lowe", "Affiliation": "1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Ventura", "Affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Dec18"}]
