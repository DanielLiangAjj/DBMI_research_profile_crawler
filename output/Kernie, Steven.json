[{"PMID": "38180982", "Title": "Distinct microglial transcriptomic signatures within the hippocampus.", "Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are crucial in the development of the nervous system. Recent evidence demonstrates that microglia modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation of neural precursors and survival both in vitro and in vivo, thus maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death in the neural stem cell pool. There are increasing reports suggesting these microglia found in neurogenic niches differ from their counterparts in non-neurogenic areas. Here, we present evidence that hippocampal microglia exhibit transcriptomic heterogeneity, with some cells expressing genes associated with neurogenesis. By comprehensively profiling myeloid lineage cells in the hippocampus using single cell RNA-sequencing, we have uncovered a small, yet distinct population of microglia which exhibit depletion in genes associated with homeostatic microglia and enrichment of genes associated with phagocytosis. Intriguingly, this population also expresses a gene signature with substantial overlap with previously characterized phenotypes, including disease associated microglia (DAM), a particularly unique and compelling microglial state.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Microglia", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Transcriptome", "Hippocampus", "Neurogenesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sana", "Last Name": "Chintamen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pallavi", "Last Name": "Gaur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Vo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38071779", "Title": "Delphi Process for Validation of Fluid Treatment Algorithm for Critically Ill Pediatric Trauma Patients.", "Abstract": "While intravenous fluid therapy is essential to re-establishing volume status in children who have experienced trauma, aggressive resuscitation can lead to various complications.

Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-\u03b2 as well as its precursor, the\u00a0APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as mitochondria-associated\u00a0endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (\"MAM\" domains). The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the epidemiological connection between TBI and AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "Brain injury", "Contact sites", "Lipids", "Mitochondria", "Neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Alzheimer Disease", "Mitochondria", "Up-Regulation", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Lipids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rishi R", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA. rra2124@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Delfina", "Last Name": "Larrea", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yimeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Biomarkers Core Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 10-105, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lingyan", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, Havemeyer Hall, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hylde", "Last Name": "Zirpoli", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leslie G", "Last Name": "Cummins", "Affiliation": "Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY, 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Emmanuele", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donghui", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, Havemeyer Hall, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Taekyung D", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank P", "Last Name": "Macaluso", "Affiliation": "Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY, 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Biomarkers Core Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 10-105, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA. estela.area@cib.csic.es."}], "Journal": "Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "36306130", "Title": "Risk Variants in the Exomes of Children With Critical Illness.", "Abstract": "Diagnostic genetic testing can lead to changes in management in the pediatric intensive care unit.

Primary intensivists (one physician serves as a consistent resource for the patient/family and PICU providers) and primary nurses (a small team of PICU nurses provide consistent bedside care) seek to augment usual transitory PICU care, by enhancing continuity and, potentially, decreasing length of stay (LOS). Methods: A single-centered, partially blinded randomized controlled trial of primary intensivists and nurses versus usual care. PICU patients admitted for or expected to be admitted for >10 days and who had \u22651 complex chronic condition were eligible. A block randomization with 1:1 allocation was used. The primary outcome was PICU LOS. Multiple secondary outcomes were explored. Results: Two hundred LSPs were randomized-half to receive primaries and half to usual care. The two groups were not significantly different in their baseline and admission characteristics. LSPs randomized to receive primaries had a shorter, but non-significant, mean LOS than those randomized to usual care (32.5 vs. 37.1 days, respectively, p\u2009=\u2009.19). Compared to LSPs in the usual care group, LSPs in the primary group had fewer unplanned intubations. Among LSPs that died, DNR orders were more prevalent in the primary group. Other secondary outcome and balance metrics were not significantly different between the two groups.

Alterations in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have long been associated with both the development of AD and recovery following TBI and ApoE is known to play a role in this process. In order to determine how ApoE might influence hippocampal injury-induced neurogenesis, we generated a conditional knockout system whereby functional ApoE from astrocytes was ablated prior to injury. While successfully ablating ApoE just prior to TBI in mice, we observed an attenuation in the development of the spines in the newborn neurons. Intriguingly, animals with a double-hit, i.e. injury and ApoE conditionally inactivated in astrocytes, demonstrated the most pronounced impairments in the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze test, failing to exhibit spatial memory after both acquisition and reversal training trials. In comparison, conditional knockout mice without injury displayed impairments but only in the reversal phase of the test, suggesting accumulative effects of astrocytic ApoE deficiency and traumatic brain injury on AD-like phenotypes.

Recent evidence demonstrates that in adulthood, microglia secrete factors which modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation and survival both in vitro and in vivo, maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death in neurogenic niches. These resident immune cells also shape the nervous system by actively pruning synapses during critical periods of learning and engulfing excess neurons. In neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant microglial activity can impede the proper formation and prevent the development of appropriate functional properties of adult born granule cells. Ablating microglia has been presented as a promising therapeutic approach to alleviate the brain of maladaptive immune response. Here, we review key mechanisms through which the immune system actively shapes neurogenic niches throughout the lifespan of the mammalian brain in both health and disease.

Within the mammalian hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) has the unique characteristic of exhibiting neurogenesis persisting into adulthood. Despite their small numbers and sparse activity, adult-born neurons (ABNs) in the DG play critical roles in memory; however, their memory function during sleep is unknown. Here, we investigate whether young ABN activity contributes to memory consolidation during sleep using Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mice. We found that contextual fear learning recruits a population of young ABNs that are reactivated during subsequent REM sleep against a backdrop of overall reduced ABN activity. Optogenetic silencing of this sparse ABN activity during REM sleep alters the structural remodeling of spines on ABN dendrites and impairs memory consolidation.

Subsequent injury-induced neurogenesis appears to be essential for at least some aspects of the innate recovery in cognitive function observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). It has previously been established that Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a regulatory role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is of particular interest as the presence of the human ApoE isoform ApoE4 leads to significant risk for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, where impaired neurogenesis has been linked with disease progression.

Therapies for improving outcomes following TBI are limited. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI may suggest novel treatment strategies to facilitate recovery and improve treatment outcome. Aberrant activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been implicated in neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. Cdk5 is a neuronal protein kinase activated via interaction with its cofactor p35 that regulates numerous neuronal functions, including synaptic remodeling and cognition. However, conversion of p35 to p25 via Ca(2+) -dependent activation of calpain results in an aberrantly active Cdk5/p25 complex that is associated with neuronal damage and cell death. Here, we show that mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI), a well-established experimental TBI model, exhibit increased p25 levels and consistently elevated Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in hippocampal lysates. Moreover, CCI-induced neuroinflammation as indicated by increased astrocytic activation and number of reactive microglia. Brain-wide conditional Cdk5 knockout mice (Cdk5 cKO) subjected to CCI exhibited significantly reduced edema, ventricular dilation, and injury area. Finally, neurophysiological recordings revealed that CCI attenuated excitatory post-synaptic potential field responses in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway 24\u00a0h after injury. This neurophysiological deficit was attenuated in Cdk5 cKO mice. Thus, TBI induces increased levels of p25 generation and aberrant Cdk5 activity, which contributes to pathophysiological processes underlying TBI progression. Hence, selectively preventing aberrant Cdk5 activity may be an effective acute strategy to improve recovery from TBI. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases astrogliosis and microglial activation. Moreover, TBI deregulates Ca(2+) -homeostasis triggering p25 production. The protein kinase Cdk5 is aberrantly activated by p25 leading to phosphorylation of substrates including tau and Rb protein. Loss of Cdk5 attenuates TBI lesion size, indicating that Cdk5 is a critical player in TBI pathogenesis and thus may be a suitable therapeutic target for TBI.", "Keywords": ["cyclin-dependent kinase 5", "microtubule-associated protein tau", "neuroinflammation", "p25", "retinoblastoma protein", "traumatic brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Calpain", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5", "Disease Models, Animal", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohammad A", "Last Name": "Yousuf", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunfeng", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa I", "Last Name": "Torres-Altoro", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang-Min", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Plautz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shanrong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Advanced Imaging Research Center, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masaya", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Advanced Imaging Research Center, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adan", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Plattner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Bibb", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "PubDate": "2016Jul"}, {"PMID": "26969621", "Title": "Intracerebroventricular administration of chondroitinase ABC reduces acute edema after traumatic brain injury in mice.", "Abstract": "Brain edema is a significant challenge facing clinicians managing severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute period.

Until now, it remained unknown whether these cells have the capacity to promote endogenous repair. We ablated NSPCs in the subventricular zone to examine their contribution to the injury microenvironment after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Studies were performed in transgenic mice expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene under the control of the nestin(\u03b4) promoter exposed to CCI injury. Two weeks after CCI injury, mice deficient in NSPCs had reduced neuronal survival in the perilesional cortex and fewer Iba-1-positive and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive glial cells but increased glial hypertrophy at the injury site. These findings suggest that the presence of NSPCs play a supportive role in the cortex to promote neuronal survival and glial cell expansion after TBI injury, which corresponds with improvements in motor function. We conclude that enhancing this endogenous response may have acute protective roles after TBI.", "Keywords": ["gliosis", "neural stem/progenitor cell ablation", "neurogenesis", "neuronal survival", "traumatic brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Injuries", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cellular Microenvironment", "Cerebral Cortex", "Lateral Ventricles", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kirsty J", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "1The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Michelle H", "Last Name": "Theus", "Affiliation": "2The Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Blacksburg, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Claudiu M", "Last Name": "Nelersa", "Affiliation": "1The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Mier", "Affiliation": "1The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Lissette G", "Last Name": "Travieso", "Affiliation": "1The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Tzong-Shiue", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "3Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "3Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Liebl", "Affiliation": "1The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "PubDate": "2015Jun01"}, {"PMID": "24922313", "Title": "Opposing effects of \u03b12- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation on quiescent neural precursor cell activity and adult hippocampal neurogenesis.", "Abstract": "Norepinephrine regulates latent neural stem cell activity and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and has an important role in modulating hippocampal functions such as learning, memory and mood. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a multi-stage process, spanning from the activation and proliferation of hippocampal stem cells, to their differentiation into neurons. However, the stage-specific effects of noradrenergic receptors in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we used transgenic Nestin-GFP mice and neurosphere assays to show that modulation of \u03b12- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activity directly affects Nestin-GFP/GFAP-positive precursor cell population albeit in an opposing fashion. While selective stimulation of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors decreases precursor cell activation, proliferation and immature neuron number, stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors activates the quiescent precursor pool and enhances their proliferation in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, our data indicate no major role for \u03b11-adrenergic receptors, as we did not observe any change in either the activation and proliferation of hippocampal precursors following selective stimulation or blockade of \u03b11-adrenergic receptors.

Fourteen had bacterial meningitis based on CSF pleocytosis and bacterial growth in either blood or CSF culture. Seventeen children with negative cultures comprised the control group. CSF Hsp72 was significantly elevated in children with bacterial meningitis compared to controls. Importantly, CSF Hsp72 levels did not correlate with the CSF white blood cell count. On receiver operator characteristic analysis, using a cut-off of 8.1 ng/mL, CSF Hsp72 has a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 94% for predicting bacterial meningitis.

The current study aimed to determine whether depleting neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) affects poststroke functional outcome in nestin-\u03b4-HSV-TK-EGFP transgenic mice, in which the expression of a truncated viral thymidine kinase gene and EGFP was restricted to nestin-expressing NPCs. Ganciclovir (GCV; 200 mg/kg/d) or saline was continuously administered via osmotic pumps in mice for 4 weeks before the induction of experimental stroke. Both baseline and stroke-induced type 1 and type 2 NPCs were conditionally ablated. GCV eliminated NPCs in a duration-dependent fashion, but it did not attenuate the genesis of astroglia or oligodendrocytes in the peri-infarct cortex, nor did it affect infarct size or cerebral blood reperfusion after stroke. Transgenic stroke mice given GCV displayed impaired spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze test compared with saline control or wild-type stroke mice given GCV, suggesting a contributing role of stroke-induced neurogenesis in the recovery of cognitive function. However, there was no significant difference in poststroke motor function between transgenic mice treated with GCV and those treated with vehicle, despite a significant ablation of NPCs in the subventricular zone of the former. Furthermore, nestin-\u03b4-HSV-TK-EGFP mice treated with GCV had fewer retrogradely labeled neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) when injected with the polysynaptic viral marker PRV614 in the dentate gyrus (DG), suggesting that there might be reduced synaptic connectivity between the DG and EC following ablation of NPCs, which may contribute to impaired poststroke memory function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cognition", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Perforant Pathway", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chongran", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94121, San Francisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94121, Department of Neurological Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, Hangzhou 310009, China, Department of Neurological Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 201101, China, Department of Neurological Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan, Departments of Bioengineering and Ophthalmology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, and Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chih Cheng", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yosuke", "Last Name": "Akamatsu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruikang K", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jialing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Oct30"}, {"PMID": "23843451", "Title": "Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the germinal matrix induces neurovascular proteases and intraventricular hemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage in preterm neonates may result in neonatal mortality and functional disabilities, but its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly defined and better therapies are needed. We used a tetracycline-regulated transgenic system to test whether the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the germinal matrix leads to intracranial hemorrhage. This genetic strategy initially induced a dense network of loosely adjoined endothelial cells and pericytes near lateral ventricles, similar to the immature vascular rete in human fetal brains. Yet, this rich vascular network transformed into low-vasculature patches correlated with hemorrhage and caspase-3 activation near birth. Gene expression and biochemical analyses suggested that downstream mediators of VEGF in this network include transcriptional factors ETS1 and HIF2\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1), components of the PDGF\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2) and TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) receptor signaling pathways, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cathepsins. Prenatal administration of glucocorticoids markedly reduced mortality and cerebral hemorrhage in mutant animals, as in human neonates. This protective effect was not due to blocking vasculogenesis, but was instead associated with inhibition of neurovascular proteases, notably MMP-9, cathepsin B, and caspase-3. Collectively, these results support a causative role of VEGF in perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and implicate its downstream proteases as potential therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Betamethasone", "Caspase 3", "Cathepsin B", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Disease Models, Animal", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Enzyme Activation", "Enzyme Induction", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9", "Mice", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Peptide Hydrolases", "Phenotype", "Prosencephalon", "Protease Inhibitors", "Tetracycline", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dianer", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica M", "Last Name": "Baumann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yu-Yo", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mianzhi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard Scott", "Last Name": "Dunn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ann L", "Last Name": "Akeson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suhas", "Last Name": "Kallapur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diana M", "Last Name": "Lindquist", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stanley Steven", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hung-Chi", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chia-Yi", "Last Name": "Kuan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jul10"}, {"PMID": "23639664", "Title": "Advances in pediatric neurocritical care.", "Abstract": "Because pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) improve survival for a range of acute diseases, attention has turned toward ensuring the best possible functional outcomes after critical illness.

Using a transgenic mouse that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) within this progenitor population we have previously shown that exposure to chronic hypoxia significantly decreases the progenitor stem cell pool in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus that is in part mediated by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Hence we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of the mTOR pathway using rapamycin will alter the progenitor stem cell pool and impair the development of the dentate gyrus. We find that prolonged inhibition of the mTOR pathway causes a decrease in the early progenitor stem cell pool, demonstrated by decreased GFP-expressing progenitors, which persists long term. However there is a significant increase in proliferating progenitor cell pool, as seen by increased BrdU that is coupled with increased apoptosis thereby leading to fewer Neu N-expressing mature neurons. Further inhibition of the mTOR pathway leads to depletion of the astrocyte and microglial pool in the dentate gyrus as well.
