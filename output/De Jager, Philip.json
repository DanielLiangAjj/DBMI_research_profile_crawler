Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence. These results provide important insights into transcriptional dysregulation in xenografted APPV717I neurons linked to synaptic function, and they indicate that LINGO2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Disease modeling", "Grafts", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "Transplantation", "iPSCs", "snRNA-seq"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "Animals", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Mutation", "Membrane Proteins", "Synapses", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Mares", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed A", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. vm2545@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38917802", "Title": "Chemokine-mediated cell migration into the central nervous system in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.", "Abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been associated with different forms of immune compromise.

Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these \"mind-mitochondria\" associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues.

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and play a key role in neurodevelopment. Disruption of microglial functions can lead to brain abnormalities and increase the risk of developing NDDs. How the maternal as well as the fetal immune system affect human neurodevelopment and contribute to NDDs remains unclear. An important reason for this knowledge gap is the fact that the impact of exposure to prenatal risk factors has been challenging to study in the human context. Here, we characterized a model of cerebral organoids (CO) with integrated microglia (COiMg). These organoids express typical microglial markers and respond to inflammatory stimuli. The presence of microglia influences cerebral organoid development, including cell density and neural differentiation, and regulates the expression of several ciliated mesenchymal cell markers. Moreover, COiMg and organoids without microglia show similar but also distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 induced significant transcriptional and structural changes in the cerebral organoids, that appear to be regulated by the presence of microglia. Specifically, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) was found to alter the expression of genes linked to autism.

"Abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult-onset, sporadic synucleinopathy characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and dysautonomia. The genetic architecture of MSA is poorly understood, and treatments are limited to supportive measures. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequence data from 888 European-ancestry MSA cases and 7,128 controls to systematically investigate the genetic underpinnings of this understudied neurodegenerative disease. We identified four significantly associated risk loci using a genome-wide association study approach. Transcriptome-wide association analyses prioritized USP38-DT, KCTD7, and lnc-KCTD7-2 as novel susceptibility genes for MSA within these loci, and single-nucleus RNA sequence analysis found that the associated variants acted as cis-expression quantitative trait loci for multiple genes across neuronal and glial cell types. In conclusion, this study highlights the role of genetic determinants in the pathogenesis of MSA, and the publicly available data from this study represent a valuable resource for investigating synucleinopathies.", "Keywords": ["GWAS", "MSA", "TWAS", "colocalization", "gene-burden analysis", "genome-wide association study", "multiple system atrophy", "pathway analysis", "repeat expansion mapping", "transcriptome-wide association study", "whole genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Chia", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anindita", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zalak", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinhui", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Group, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Ruffo", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA;

Its multifactorial risk profile and large portions of unexplained heritability suggest the involvement of yet unidentified genetic risk factors. Here we describe the \"whole person\" genetic risk landscape of polygenic risk scores for 2218 traits in 2044 elderly individuals and test if novel eigen-PRSs derived from clustered subnetworks of single-trait PRSs can improve the prediction of LOAD diagnosis, rates of cognitive decline, and canonical LOAD neuropathology. Network analyses revealed distinct clusters of PRSs with clinical and biological interpretability. Novel eigen-PRSs (ePRS) from these clusters significantly improved LOAD-related phenotypes prediction over current state-of-the-art LOAD PRS models. Notably, an ePRS representing clusters of traits related to cholesterol levels was able to improve variance explained in a model of the brain-wide beta-amyloid burden by 1.7% (likelihood ratio test P\u2009=\u20099.02\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). All associations of ePRS with LOAD phenotypes were eliminated by the removal of APOE-proximal loci. However, our association analysis identified modules characterized by PRSs of high cholesterol and LOAD. We believe this is due to the influence of the APOE region from both PRSs. We found significantly higher mean SNP effects for LOAD in the intersecting APOE region SNPs. Combining genetic risk factors for vascular traits and dementia could improve current single-trait PRS models of LOAD, enhancing the use of PRS in risk stratification. Our results are catalogued for the scientific community, to aid in generating new hypotheses based on our maps of clustered PRSs and associations with LOAD-related phenotypes.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "aging", "genetics", "neuropathology", "polygenicrisk score"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amin", "Last Name": "Kharaghani", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 250 College Street, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Earvin S", "Last Name": "Tio", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 250 College Street, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Milos", "Last Name": "Milic", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 250 College Street, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, 1750 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, United States."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Centre for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, 1750 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, 155 College Street, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Felsky", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 250 College Street, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2024Apr27"}, {"PMID": "38659743", "Title": "Bridging the Gap: Multi-Omics Profiling of Brain Tissue in Alzheimer's Disease and Older Controls in Multi-Ethnic Populations.", "Abstract": "Multi-omics studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed many potential disease pathways and therapeutic targets.

"Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains. However, the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we combined single-cell analyses of FTD patient brains with a stem cell culture and transplantation model of FTD. We identified disease phenotypes in FTD neurons carrying the MAPT-N279K mutation, which were related to oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation with an upregulation of the inflammation-associated protein osteopontin (OPN). Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts. Notably, downregulation of OPN in engrafted FTD neurons resulted in improved engraftment and reduced microglial infiltration, indicating an immune-modulatory role of OPN in patient neurons, which may represent a potential therapeutic target in FTD.", "Keywords": ["FTD", "MAPT N279K", "OPN", "Spp1", "Tau", "disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia", "induced pluripotent stem cells", "microglia", "neuroinflammation", "osteopontin", "single nucleus RNA sequencing", "snRNA-seq", "transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Osteopontin", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Neurons", "Animals", "tau Proteins", "Mice", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Microglia", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA;

To bridge the cognitive neuroscience and cell biology scale gap, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3\u00d73\u00d73 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes including OxPhos enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains a diversity of mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared to white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. We show that the more abundant grey matter mitochondria also are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backward linear regression model integrating several neuroimaging modalities11, thereby generating a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization that predicts mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This new approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain functions, relating it to neuroimaging data, and defining the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.", "Keywords": ["MRI", "OxPhos", "anatomical mapping", "brain voxelization", "mitochondria", "neuroimaging", "phenotyping", "single-cell RNA sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eugene V", "Last Name": "Mosharov", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ayelet M", "Last Name": "Rosenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Monzel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Corey A", "Last Name": "Osto", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "Linsey", "Last Name": "Stiles", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "Gorazd B", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Snehal", "Last Name": "Bindra", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ya", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Madeline B", "Last Name": "Mariani", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mihran", "Last Name": "Bakalian", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Divisions of Molecular Therapeutics and Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Neuroimmunology Division, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Orian S", "Last Name": "Shirihai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "J John", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Underwood", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Thiebaut de Schotten", "Affiliation": "Brain Connectivity and Behavior Laboratory, Paris, France;

In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes including OxPhos enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity.

Using different model systems including HMC3 cells, iPSC-derived microglia and cerebral organoids, we characterize the effect of these compounds in mimicking human microglial subtypes in vitro. We show that the Topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin induces a CD74high/MHChigh microglial subtype which is specialized in amyloid beta phagocytosis.

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to neuropathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Protective and cognitive-enhancing roles for the nicotinic \u03b15 subunit have been identified, but this gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Therefore, we investigate the nicotinic \u03b15 gene CHRNA5 and the impact of relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prefrontal cortex from 922 individuals with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We find that a genotype robustly linked to increased expression of CHRNA5 (rs1979905A2) predicts significantly reduced cortical \u03b2-amyloid load. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis suggests CHRNA5 has a distinct cellular expression profile compared to other nicotinic receptor genes. Consistent with this prediction, single nucleus RNA sequencing from 22 individuals reveals CHRNA5 expression is disproportionately elevated in chandelier neurons, a distinct subtype of inhibitory neuron known for its role in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. We show that chandelier neurons are enriched in amyloid-binding proteins compared to basket cells, the other major subtype of PVALB-positive interneurons. Consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinic receptors in chandelier cells normally protect against \u03b2-amyloid, cell-type proportion analysis from 549 individuals reveals these neurons show amyloid-associated vulnerability only in individuals with impaired function/trafficking of nicotinic \u03b15-containing receptors due to homozygosity of the missense CHRNA5 SNP (rs16969968A2).

Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Arnold", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mustafa", "Last Name": "Buyukozkan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "P Murali", "Last Name": "Doraiswamy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwangsik", "Last Name": "Nho", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Vilmundur", "Last Name": "Gudnason", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Lenore J", "Last Name": "Launer", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Science, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Wang-Sattler", "Affiliation": "Research Unit of Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jerzy", "Last Name": "Adamski", "Affiliation": "Institute of Experimental Genetics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Metabolomics Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nil\u00fcfer", "Last Name": "Ertekin-Taner", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neuroscience and Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Saykin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany; IBE, Medical Faculty, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t, Munich, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), Munich, Germany; German Center for Cardiovascular Disease (DZHK e.V.), Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Karsten", "Last Name": "Suhre", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Education City, Doha, Qatar."}, {"First Name": "Rima", "Last Name": "Kaddurah-Daouk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabi", "Last Name": "Kastenm\u00fcller", "Affiliation": "Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Krumsiek", "Affiliation": "Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jan24"}, {"PMID": "38260600", "Title": "Somatic cancer driver mutations are enriched and associated with inflammatory states in Alzheimer's disease microglia.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss and pathological accumulation of the misfolded proteins amyloid-\u03b2 and tau1,2. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and brain-resident macrophages plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis1-5, though the mechanisms by which age, genes, and other risk factors interact remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations accumulate with age and lead to clonal expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many non-cancer diseases6,7. Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD brains by three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions revealed significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls. Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions (sIndels) in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with recurrent, and often multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)8,9. Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD brains, and the high proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in cancer driver genes suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE). Analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) from temporal neocortex of 62 additional AD cases and controls exhibited nominally increased mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) associated with CH10,11. Microglia carrying mCA showed upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, resembling the transcriptomic features of disease-associated microglia (DAM) in AD. Our results suggest that somatic driver mutations in microglia are common with normal aging but further enriched in AD brain, driving MiCE with inflammatory and DAM signatures.

However, an important question is the extent to which so-called \"normal-appearing\" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter.

Each has been individually associated with Alzheimer's dementia, cognitive function, and pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic age and mtDNAcn have been studied in brain tissue directly but prior work on TL in brain is limited to small sample sizes and most studies have examined leukocyte TL. Importantly, TL, epigenetic age clocks, and mtDNAcn have not been studied jointly in brain tissue from an AD cohort. We examined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from N\u2009=\u2009367 participants of the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). TL and mtDNAcn were estimated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and cortical clock age was computed on 347 CpG sites. We examined dementia, MCI, and level of and change in cognition, pathologic AD, and three quantitative AD traits, as well as measures of other neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). We previously showed that mtDNAcn from DLPFC brain tissue was associated with clinical and pathologic features of AD. Here, we show that those associations are independent of TL. We found TL to be associated with \u03b2-amyloid levels (beta\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.15, p\u2009=\u20090.023), hippocampal sclerosis (OR\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009=\u20090.0015) and cerebral atherosclerosis (OR\u2009=\u20091.44, p\u2009=\u20090.0007). We found strong associations between mtDNAcn and clinical measures of AD. The strongest associations with pathologic measures of AD were with cortical clock and there were associations of mtDNAcn with global AD pathology and tau tangles. Of the other pathologic traits, mtDNAcn was associated with hippocampal sclerosis, macroscopic infarctions and CAA and cortical clock was associated with Lewy bodies. Multi-modal age acceleration, accelerated aging on both mtDNAcn and cortical clock, had greater effect size than a single measure alone. These findings highlight for the first time that age acceleration determined on multiple genomic measures, mtDNAcn and cortical clock may have a larger effect on AD/AD related disorders (ADRD) pathogenesis than single measures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Genomics", "Brain", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Aging", "Hippocampal Sclerosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan T", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret A", "Last Name": "Taub", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose M", "Last Name": "Farfel", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingyun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Abadir", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francine", "Last Name": "Grodstein", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rasika A", "Last Name": "Mathias", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. rmathias@jhmi.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2023Sep07"}, {"PMID": "37611586", "Title": "Cell-type-specific regulation of APOE and CLU levels in human neurons by the Alzheimer's disease risk gene SORL1.", "Abstract": "SORL1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through genetic studies.

As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score (P=0.001). In multivariable analysis of the remaining 722 individuals, higher transcriptomic score of MIND diet was associated with slower annual rate of decline in global cognition (\u03b2=0.011 per standard deviation increment in transcriptomic profile score, P=0.003) and lower odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR] =0.76, P=0.0002). Cortical expression of several genes appeared to mediate the association between MIND diet and dementia, including TCIM, whose expression in inhibitory neurons and oligodendrocytes was associated with dementia in a subset of 424 individuals with single-nuclei RNA-seq data. In a secondary Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically predicted transcriptomic profile score was associated with dementia (OR=0.93, P=0.04).

Areas of particular interest include the influence of lifestyle, nutrition, and vitamin deficiencies on autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. In this review, we discuss how particular lifestyles and dietary patterns may contribute to or modulate autoimmunity. We explored this concept through a spectrum of several autoimmune diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Alopecia Areata (AA) affecting the central nervous system, whole body, and the hair follicles, respectively. A clear commonality between the autoimmune conditions of interest here is low Vitamin D, a well-researched hormone in the context of autoimmunity with pleiotropic immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. While low levels are often correlated with disease activity and progression in MS and AA, the relationship is less clear in SLE. Despite strong associations with autoimmunity, we lack conclusive evidence which elucidates its role in contributing to pathogenesis or simply as a result of chronic inflammation. In a similar vein, other vitamins impacting the development and course of these diseases are explored in this review, and overall diet and lifestyle. Recent work exploring the effects of dietary interventions on MS showed that a balanced diet was linked to improvement in clinical parameters, comorbid conditions, and overall quality of life for patients. In patients with MS, SLE and AA, certain diets and supplements are linked to lower incidence and improved symptoms. Conversely, obesity during adolescence was linked with higher incidence of MS while in SLE it was associated with organ damage. Autoimmunity is thought to emerge from the complex interplay between environmental factors and genetic background. Although the scope of this review focuses on environmental factors, it is imperative to elaborate the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environment due to the multifactorial origin of these disease. Here, we offer a comprehensive review about the influence of recent environmental and lifestyle factors on these autoimmune diseases and potential translation into therapeutic interventions.",

However, existing subtyping studies have mostly focused on single data modalities and only those individuals with severe cognitive impairment. To address these gaps, we applied similarity network fusion, a method capable of integrating multiple high-dimensional multi-omic data modalities simultaneously, to an elderly sample spanning the full spectrum of cognitive ageing trajectories. We analyzed human frontal cortex brain samples characterized by five omic modalities: bulk RNA sequencing (18 629 genes), DNA methylation (53 932 CpG sites), histone acetylation (26 384 peaks), proteomics (7737 proteins) and metabolomics (654 metabolites). Similarity network fusion followed by spectral clustering was used for subtype detection, and subtype numbers were determined by Eigen-gap and rotation cost statistics. Normalized mutual information determined the relative contribution of each modality to the fused network. Subtypes were characterized by associations with 13 age-related neuropathologies and cognitive decline. Fusion of all five data modalities (n = 111) yielded two subtypes (n S1 = 53, n S2 = 58), which were nominally associated with diffuse amyloid plaques; however, this effect was not significant after correction for multiple testing. Histone acetylation (normalized mutual information = 0.38), DNA methylation (normalized mutual information = 0.18) and RNA abundance (normalized mutual information = 0.15) contributed most strongly to this network. Secondary analysis integrating only these three modalities in a larger subsample (n = 513) indicated support for both three- and five-subtype solutions, which had significant overlap, but showed varying degrees of internal stability and external validity. One subtype showed marked cognitive decline, which remained significant even after correcting for tests across both three- and five-subtype solutions (p Bonf = 5.9 \u00d7 10-3). Comparison to single-modality subtypes demonstrated that the three-modal subtypes were able to uniquely capture cognitive variability. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses explored influences of sample size and cluster number parameters. We identified highly integrative molecular subtypes of ageing derived from multiple high dimensional, multi-omic data modalities simultaneously. Fusing RNA abundance, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation measures generated subtypes that were associated with cognitive decline.

In contrast, caudate TREM2 levels were not related to AD pathology, cognition, or diagnosis, but were positively related to the proportion of activated microglia in the same region.

Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging 5. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan.

Herein, a whole-genome sequencing study in four affected and four healthy relatives of a consanguineous Italian family identified a novel missense c.1801T > C (p.S601P) variant in the GRAMD1B gene that is shared within MS cases and resides under a linkage peak (LOD: 2.194). Sequencing GRAMD1B in 91 familial MS cases revealed two additional rare missense and two splice-site variants, two of which (rs755488531 and rs769527838) were not found in 1000 Italian healthy controls. Functional studies demonstrated that GRAMD1B, a gene with unknown function in the central nervous system (CNS), is expressed by several cell types, including astrocytes, microglia and neurons as well as by peripheral monocytes and macrophages. Notably, GRAMD1B was downregulated in vessel-associated astrocytes of active MS lesions in autopsied brains and by inflammatory stimuli in peripheral monocytes, suggesting a possible role in the modulation of inflammatory response and disease pathophysiology.", "Keywords": ["multiple sclerosis", "neurology", "rare variants", "sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Genetic Predisposition to

contribution to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility, with 32 independent effects across the region explaining 20% of the heritability in European populations. Variation is high across populations with allele frequency differences and population-specific risk alleles identified. We sought to identify MHC-specific MS susceptibility variants and assess the effect of ancestral risk modification within 2652 Latinx and Hispanic individuals as well as 2435 Black and African American individuals. We have identified several novel susceptibility alleles which are rare in European populations including HLA-B*53:01, and we have utilized the differing linkage disequilibrium patterns inherent to these populations to identify an independent role for HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DQB1*06:02 on MS risk. We found a decrease in Native American ancestry in MS cases vs controls across the MHC, peaking near the previously identified MICB locus with a decrease of ~5.5% in Hispanics and ~0.4% in African Americans. We have identified several susceptibility variants, including within the MICB gene region, which show global ancestry risk modification and indicate ancestral differences which may be due in part to correlated environmental factors. We have also identified several susceptibility variants for which MS risk is modified by local ancestry and indicate true ancestral genetic differences; including HLA-DQB1*06:02 for which MS risk for European allele carriers is almost two times the risk for African allele carriers. These results validate the importance of investigating MS susceptibility at an ancestral level and offer insight into the epidemiology of MS phenotypic diversity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alleles", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Haplotypes", "HLA-DRB1 Chains", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Risk", "European People", "African People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashley H", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "John P.

In CH, we identified 2802 significant DE genes, including several LOAD known-loci. DE effects were highly concordant across ethnicities, with 373 genes transcriptome-wide significant in all three cohorts. Cross-ancestry meta-analysis found NPNT to be the top DE gene. We replicated over 82% of meta-analyses genome-wide signals in single-nucleus RNA-seq data (including NPNT and LOAD known-genes SORL1, FBXL7, CLU, ABCA7). Increasing representation in genetic studies will allow for deeper understanding of ancestry-specific mechanisms and improving precision treatment options in understudied groups.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Brain gene expression", "Bulk tissue", "Caribbean-Hispanic", "Single cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Transcriptome", "Alzheimer Disease", "Caribbean People", "Ethnicity", "Brain", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "LDL-Receptor Related Proteins", "Membrane Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Felsky", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, 250 College St., M5T 1R8, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 27 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1, Canada; Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ismael", "Last Name": "Santa-Maria", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Leon", "Last Name": "French", "Affiliation": "Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, 250 College St., M5T 1R8, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 27 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, 1653 West Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany; The Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Gertrude H.

Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) not only populate the healthy CNS parenchyma but also are suspected to contribute to multiple sclerosis pathology. Because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), unlike CNS parenchyma, is accessible for diagnostics, we evaluated whether human CSF, apart from infiltrating cells, also contains TRM cells and CNS-resident myeloid cells draining from the parenchyma or border tissues. Using deep generative models, we integrated 41 CSF and 14 CNS parenchyma single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) samples from eight independent studies, encompassing 120,629 cells. By comparing CSF immune cells collected during multiple sclerosis relapse with cells collected during therapeutic very late antigen-4 blockade, we could identify immune subsets with tissue provenance across multiple lineages, including CNS border-associated macrophages, CD8 and CD4 TRM cells, and tissue-resident natural killer cells. All lymphocytic CNS-resident cells shared expression of CXCR6 but showed differential ITGAE expression (encoding CD103). A common signature defined CD4 and CD8 TRM cells by expression of ZFP36L2, DUSP1, and ID2. We further developed a user interface-driven application based on this analysis framework for atlas-level cell identity transfer onto new CSF scRNAseq data. Together, these results define CNS-resident immune cells involved in multiple sclerosis pathology that can be detected and monitored in CSF. Targeting these cell populations might be promising to modulate immunopathology in progressive multiple sclerosis and other neuroinflammatory diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Leukocytes", "Central Nervous System", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Ostkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Deffner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Schulte-Mecklenbeck", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "W\u00fcnsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "I-Na", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gregory F", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St.\u00a0Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Goelz", "Affiliation": "Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New\u00a0York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanja", "Last Name": "Kuhlmann", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Catharina C", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Luisa", "Last Name": "Klotz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Meyer Zu H\u00f6rste", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Heinz", "Last Name": "Wiendl", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tilman", "Last Name": "Schneider-Hohendorf", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster 48149, Germany."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2022Nov30"}, {"PMID": "36448302", "Title": "Not all roads lead to the immune system: the genetic basis of multiple sclerosis severity.", "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a leading cause of neurological disability in adults. Heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis clinical presentation has posed a major challenge for identifying genetic variants associated with disease outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we used prospectively ascertained clinical outcomes data from the largest international multiple sclerosis registry, MSBase. We assembled a cohort of deeply phenotyped individuals of European ancestry with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. We used unbiased genome-wide association study and machine learning approaches to assess the genetic contribution to longitudinally defined multiple sclerosis severity phenotypes in 1813 individuals. Our primary analyses did not identify any genetic variants of moderate to large effect sizes that met genome-wide significance thresholds. The strongest signal was associated with rs7289446 (\u03b2 = -0.4882, P = 2.73 \u00d7 10-7), intronic to SEZ6L on chromosome 22. However, we demonstrate that clinical outcomes in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis are associated with multiple genetic loci of small effect sizes. Using a machine learning approach incorporating over 62 000 variants together with clinical and demographic variables available at multiple sclerosis disease onset, we could predict severity with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.88). Our machine learning algorithm achieved positive predictive value for outcome assignation of 80% and negative predictive value of 88%. This outperformed our machine learning algorithm that contained clinical and demographic variables alone (area under the receiver operator curve 0.54, 95% CI 0.48-0.60). Secondary, sex-stratified analyses identified two genetic loci that met genome-wide significance thresholds. One in females (rs10967273; \u03b2female = 0.8289, P = 3.52 \u00d7 10-8), the other in males (rs698805; \u03b2male = -1.5395, P = 4.35 \u00d7 10-8), providing some evidence for sex dimorphism in multiple sclerosis severity. Tissue enrichment and pathway analyses identified an overrepresentation of genes expressed in CNS compartments generally, and specifically in the cerebellum (P = 0.023). These involved mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, oligodendroglial biology, cellular senescence, calcium and G-protein receptor signalling pathways. We further identified six variants with strong evidence for regulating clinical outcomes, the strongest signal again intronic to SEZ6L (adjusted hazard ratio 0.72, P = 4.85 \u00d7 10-4). Here we report a milestone in our progress towards understanding the clinical heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis outcomes, implicating functionally distinct mechanisms to multiple sclerosis risk. Importantly, we demonstrate that machine learning using common single nucleotide variant clusters, together with clinical variables readily available at diagnosis can improve prognostic capabilities at diagnosis, and with further validation has the potential to translate to meaningful clinical practice change.", "Keywords": ["disease severity", "genetics", "machine learning", "multiple sclerosis", "prognostics"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prognosis", "Immune System"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vilija G", "Last Name": "Jokubaitis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Maria Pia", "Last Name": "Campagna", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Ibrahim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jim", "Last Name": "Stankovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Pavlina", "Last Name": "Kleinova", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, 500 05 Prague, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Fuencisla", "Last Name": "Matesanz", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitolog\u00eda y Biomedicina L\u00f3pez Neyra, CSIC, 18016 Granada, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Division of Genetics, Department of Medicine Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Brookline, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Eichau", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, 41009 Sevilla, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Slee", "Affiliation": "College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jeannette", "Last Name": "Lechner-Scott", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, NSW 2305, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rodney", "Last Name": "Lea", "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Centre, Centre of Genomics and Personalised Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Trevor J", "Last Name": "Kilpatrick", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Melbourne Health, Melbourne, VIC 3050, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Kalincik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Melbourne Health, Melbourne, VIC 3050, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Multiple Sclerosis Center and the Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "John.

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4\u2009million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show\u00a0that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90\u2009kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Body

To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian functional GWAS method to account for multivariate quantitative functional annotations (BFGWAS_QUANT), accompanied by a scalable computation algorithm enabling joint modeling of genome-wide variants. Simulation studies validated the performance of BFGWAS_QUANT for accurately quantifying annotation enrichment and improving GWAS power. Applying BFGWAS_QUANT to study five Alzheimer disease (AD)-related phenotypes using individual-level GWAS data (n\u00a0= \u223c1,000), we found that histone modification annotations have higher enrichment than expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) annotations for all considered phenotypes, with the highest enrichment in H3K27me3 (polycomb regression). We also found that cis-eQTLs in microglia had higher enrichment than eQTLs of bulk brain frontal cortex tissue for all considered phenotypes. A similar enrichment pattern was also identified using the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary-level GWAS data of AD (n\u00a0= \u223c54,000). The strongest known APOE E4 risk allele was identified for all five phenotypes, and the APOE locus was validated using the IGAP data. BFGWAS_QUANT fine-mapped 32 significant variants from 1,073 genome-wide significant variants in the IGAP data. We also demonstrated that the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using effect size estimates by BFGWAS_QUANT had a similar prediction accuracy as other methods assuming a sparse causal model. Overall, BFGWAS_QUANT is a useful GWAS tool for quantifying annotation enrichment and prioritizing potential causal variants.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Bayesian hierarchical variable selection regression", "fine-mapping", "genome-wide association study", "molecular quantitative trait loci", "polygenic risk score", "quantitative functional annotation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junyu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Emory University School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aron S", "Last Name": "Buchman", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}], "Journal": "HGG advances", "PubDate": "2022Oct13"}, {"PMID": "36041861", "Title": "Toward Precision Phenotyping of Multiple Sclerosis.", "Abstract": "The classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been established by Lublin in 1996 and revised in 2013. The revision includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting, primary progressive and secondary progressive MS, and has added activity (i.e., formation of white matter lesions or clinical relapses) as a qualifier. This allows for the distinction between active and nonactive progression, which has been shown to be of clinical importance. We propose that a logical extension of this classification is the incorporation of additional key pathological processes, such as chronic perilesional inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration, and remyelination. This will distinguish MS phenotypes that may present as clinically identical but are driven by different combinations of pathological processes. A more precise description of MS phenotypes will improve prognostication and personalized care as well as clinical trial design. Thus, our proposal provides an expanded framework for conceptualizing MS and for guiding development of biomarkers for monitoring activity along the main pathological axes in MS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive", "Nervous System Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "From the Yale University (David Pitt, C.H.L., E.L., M.M., M.R.L.), New Haven;

Hence, we examined the associations of common genetic variants with verbal short-term memory and verbal learning in adults without dementia or stroke (N\u2009=\u200953,637). We identified novel loci in the intronic region of CDH18, and at 13q21 and 3p21.1, as well as an expected signal in the APOE/APOC1/TOMM40 region. These results replicated in an independent sample. Functional and bioinformatic analyses supported many of these loci and further implicated POC1. We showed that polygenic score for verbal learning associated with brain activation in right parieto-occipital region during working memory task. Finally, we showed genetic correlations of these memory traits with several neurocognitive and health outcomes. Our findings suggest a role of several genomic loci in verbal memory processes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Memory, Short-Term", "Learning", "Verbal Learning", "Multifactorial Inheritance",

Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, which show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.", "Keywords": ["complex traits", "fine-mapping", "functional genomics", "lipid biology", "post-GWAS", "regulatory mechanism", "variant prioritization"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromatin", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Lipids", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shweta", "Last Name": "Ramdas", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Judd", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kanoni", "Affiliation": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yuxuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ida", "Last Name": "Surakka", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Wenz", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoa L", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA;

In this study, we performed an eQTL analysis using single-nuclei RNA sequencing from 192 individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 eGenes, a substantial fraction (46%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level eQTLs affected more constrained genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level eQTLs. Integration of brain cell type eQTLs with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed novel relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For most GWAS loci, a single gene co-localized in a single cell type, providing new clues into disease etiology. Our findings demonstrate substantial contrast in genetic regulation of gene expression among brain cell types and reveal potential mechanisms by which disease risk genes influence brain disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Nervous System Diseases", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Quantitative Trait Loci"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Bryois", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience and Rare Diseases, F.

However, many APOE-\u03b54 carriers remain cognitively normal throughout life, suggesting that neuroprotective factors may be present in these individuals. In this study, we leverage whole-blood RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from 324 older adults to identify genetic modifiers of APOE-\u03b54 effects on cognition. Expression of RNASE6 interacted with APOE-\u03b54 status (p\u00a0=\u00a04.35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) whereby higher RNASE6 expression was associated with worse memory at baseline among APOE-\u03b54 carriers. This interaction was replicated using RNAseq data from the prefrontal cortex in an independent dataset (N\u00a0=\u00a0535; p = 0.002), suggesting the peripheral effect of RNASE6 is also present in brain tissue. RNASE6 encodes an antimicrobial peptide involved in innate immune response and has been previously observed in a gene co-expression network module with other AD-related inflammatory genes, including TREM2 and MS4A. Together, these data implicate neuroinflammation in cognitive decline, and suggest that innate immune signaling may be detectable in blood and confer differential susceptibility to AD depending on APOE-\u03b54.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's", "Blood", "Brain", "Cognition", "Gene expression"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Exonucleases", "Genotype", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mabel", "Last Name": "Seto", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca L", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Logan", "Last Name": "Dumitrescu", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily R", "Last Name": "Mahoney", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shania L", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vaibhav", "Last Name": "Janve", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Omair A", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dandan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Cell Circuits Program, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine A", "Last Name": "Gifford", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela L", "Last Name": "Jefferson", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Hohman", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.

Prodromal stages are well recognized in some neurological and immune-mediated diseases such as Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis. Emerging evidence indicates that a prodromal stage exists in multiple sclerosis (MS), raising the possibility of intervention at this stage to delay or prevent the development of classical MS. However, much remains unclear about the prodromal stage of MS and considerable research is needed to fully characterize the prodrome and develop standardized criteria to reliably identify individuals with prodromal MS who are at high risk of progressing to a diagnosis of MS. In this Roadmap, we draw on work in other diseases to propose a disease framework for MS that incorporates the prodromal stage, and set out key steps and considerations needed in future research to fully characterize the MS prodrome, identify early disease markers and develop standardized criteria that will enable reliable identification of individuals with prodromal MS, thereby facilitating

However, it remains unclear which neuronal subtypes beyond broad excitatory and inhibitory classes are most vulnerable. Here, we analyzed cell subtype proportion differences in AD compared to non-AD controls using 1037 post-mortem brain samples from six neocortical regions. We identified the strongest associations of AD with fewer somatostatin (SST) inhibitory neurons (\u03b2 = -0.48, p bonf = 8.98 \u00d7 10-9) and intra-telencephalic (IT) excitatory neurons (\u03b2 = -0.45, p bonf = 4.32 \u00d7 10-7). Replication in three AD case-control single-nucleus RNAseq datasets most strongly supported the bulk tissue association of fewer SST neurons in AD. In depth analyses of cell type proportions with specific AD-related neuropathological and cognitive phenotypes revealed fewer SST neurons with greater brain-wide post-mortem tau and beta amyloid, as well as a faster rate of antemortem cognitive decline. In contrast, greater IT neuron proportions were associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline as well as greater residual cognition-a measure of cognitive resilience-but not canonical AD neuropathology. Our findings implicate somatostatin inhibitory and intra-telencephalic excitatory neuron subclasses in the pathogenesis of AD and in cognitive resilience to AD pathology, respectively.", "Keywords":

The N terminus of \u03b1S, but not other synucleins, dictates mutually exclusive binding either to cellular membranes or to P-bodies in the cytosol. \u03b1S associates with multiple decapping proteins in close proximity on the Edc4 scaffold. As \u03b1S pathologically accumulates, aberrant interaction with Edc4 occurs at the expense of physiologic decapping-module interactions. mRNA decay kinetics within PD-relevant pathways are correspondingly disrupted in PD patient neurons and brain. Genetic modulation of P-body components alters \u03b1S toxicity, and human genetic analysis lends support to the disease-relevance of these interactions.

Contrary to humans, a zebrafish can regenerate its diseased brain, and thus is ideal for studying neurogenesis. To compare the AD-related molecular pathways between humans and zebrafish, we compared single cell or nuclear transcriptomic data from a zebrafish amyloid toxicity model and its controls (N = 12) with the datasets of two human adult brains (N = 10 and N = 48 (Microglia)), and one fetal brain (N = 10). Approximately 95.4% of the human and zebrafish cells co-clustered. Within each cell type, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched KEGG pathways, and gene ontology terms. We studied synergistic and non-synergistic DEGs to point at either common or uniquely altered mechanisms across species. Using the top DEGs, a high concordance in gene expression changes between species was observed in neuronal clusters. On the other hand, the molecular pathways affected by AD in zebrafish astroglia differed from humans in favor of the neurogenic pathways. The integration of zebrafish and human transcriptomes shows that the zebrafish can be used as a tool to study the cellular response to amyloid proteinopathies.

We thus systematically investigated this and other subsets of TFH within untreated HIV-infected human lymph nodes using Mass CyTOF and a combination of RNA and TCR repertoire sequencing. We show an inflation of the CXCR3+TFH compartment during HIV infection that correlates with a lower HIV burden. Deeper analysis into this population revealed a functional shift of CXCR3+TFH away from germinal center TFH (GC-TFH), including the altered expression of several important transcription factors and cytokines. CXCR3+TFH also upregulated cell migration transcriptional programs and were clonally related to peripheral TFH populations. In combination, these data suggest that CXCR3+TFH have a greater tendency to enter circulation than their CXCR3- counterparts, potentially functioning through distinct modalities that may lead to enhanced defense.", "Keywords": ["CXCR3", "HIV", "RNA-seq", "TCR repertoire", "follicular-helper T cells (TFH)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Germinal Center", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Mice", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Receptors, CXCR3", "T Follicular Helper Cells", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chenfeng", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Malone", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ben S", "Last Name": "Wendel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ke-Yue", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Life Sciences Graduate Program, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Del Alcazar", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Perelman School of Medicine, Institute for Immunology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Perla M", "Last Name": "Del R\u00edo-Estrada", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Investigaci\u00f3n en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Yuria", "Last Name": "Ablanedo-Terrazas", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Investigaci\u00f3n en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Gustavo", "Last Name": "Reyes-Ter\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Comisi\u00f3n Coordinadora de Institutos Nacional de Salud y Hospitales de Alta Especialidad, Secretar\u00eda de Salud, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Laura F", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Perelman School of Medicine, Institute for Immunology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35608697", "Title": "FMNL2 regulates gliovascular interactions and is associated with vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) during middle age and later and is frequently accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology at death. An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

function requires the stoichiometric interaction among dozens of proteins but their co-regulation has not been defined in the human brain. Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was unrelated to mtDNA-encoded subunits abundance, suggesting that mtDNA content is not limiting. Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibited reduced abundance of complex I RC subunits, an effect largely driven by a 2-4% overall lower mitochondrial protein content. These findings provide foundational knowledge to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to age- and disease-related erosion of mitochondrial function in the human brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer

Such variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by common neurodegenerative pathologies. Hence, we aimed to identify new molecular processes underlying variation in cognitive trajectory using brain microRNA profile followed by an integrative analysis with brain transcriptome and proteome. Individual cognitive trajectories were derived from longitudinally assessed cognitive-test scores of older-adult brain donors from four longitudinal cohorts. Postmortem brain microRNA profiles, transcriptomes, and proteomes were derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The global microRNA association study of cognitive trajectory was performed in a discovery (n\u2009=\u2009454) and replication cohort (n\u2009=\u2009134), followed by a meta-analysis that identified 6 microRNAs. Among these, miR-132-3p and miR-29a-3p were most significantly associated with cognitive trajectory. They explain 18.2% and 2.0% of the variance of cognitive trajectory, respectively, and act independently of the eight measured neurodegenerative pathologies. Furthermore, integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that miR-132-3p was significantly associated with 24 of the 47 modules of co-expressed genes of the transcriptome, miR-29a-3p with 3 modules, and identified 84 and 214 downstream targets of miR-132-3p and miR-29a-3p, respectively, in cognitive trajectory. This is the first global microRNA study of cognitive trajectory to our knowledge.

Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65\u2009million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately\u2009295,000 individuals from 7\u2009ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Genetic Predisposition to

to precision medicine strategies. We estimated episodic memory trajectories in 35,245 ethnically diverse older adults representing eight independent cohorts. We conducted apolipoprotein E (APOE)-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses and combined individual cohorts' results via meta-analysis. Three independent transcriptomics datasets were used to further interpret GWAS signals. We identified DCDC2 gene significantly associated with episodic memory (Pmeta\u00a0=\u00a03.3 x 10-8 ) among non-carriers of APOE \u03b54 (N\u00a0=\u00a024,941). Brain transcriptomics revealed an association between episodic memory maintenance and (1) increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DCDC2 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a03.8 x 10-4 ) and (2) lower burden of pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks (paired helical fragment tau P\u00a0=\u00a0.003, and amyloid beta load P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Additional transcriptomics results comparing AD and cognitively healthy brain samples showed a downregulation of DCDC2 levels in superior temporal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and inferior frontal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.013).

This cascading epigenomic analysis for GWAS, which we refer to as CEWAS, comprises two types of models: one for linking cis genetic effects to epigenomic variation and another for linking cis epigenomic variation to gene expression. Applying these models in cascade to GWAS summary statistics generates gene level statistics that reflect genetically-driven epigenomic effects.

Yet, limited research has considered epigenetic clocks calculated in brain tissue. We used DNA methylation states in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens from 721 older participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, to calculate DNA methylation age using four established epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and a new Cortical clock. The four established clocks were trained in blood samples (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge) or using 51 human tissue and cell types (Horvath); the recent Cortical clock is the first trained in postmortem cortical tissue. Participants were recruited beginning in 1994 (Religious Orders Study) and 1997 (Memory and Aging Project), and followed annually with questionnaires and clinical evaluations; brain specimens were obtained for 80-90% of participants. Mean age at death was 88.0 (SD 6.7) years. We used linear regression, logistic regression, and linear mixed models, to examine relations of epigenetic clock ages to neuropathologic and clinical aging phenotypes, controlling for chronologic age, sex, education, and depressive symptomatology. Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and Cortical clock ages were related to pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to A\u03b2 load (a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease). However, associations were substantially stronger for the Cortical than other clocks; for example, each standard deviation (SD) increase in Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge clock age was related to approximately 30% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while each SD increase in Cortical age was related to 90% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95% confidence interval 1.38, 2.62). Moreover, Cortical age was significantly related to other AD pathology (eg, mean tau tangle density, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and to odds of neocortical Lewy body pathology (for each SD increase in Cortical age, odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 95% confidence 1.27, 3.17), although no clocks were related to cerebrovascular neuropathology. Cortical age was the only epigenetic clock significantly associated with the clinical phenotypes examined, from dementia to cognitive decline (5 specific cognitive systems, and a global cognitive measure averaging 17 tasks) to Parkinsonian signs.

atherosclerosis is a leading cause of stroke and an important contributor to dementia. Yet little is known about its genetic basis. To examine the association of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with cerebral atherosclerosis severity, we conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) using data collected as part of two community-based cohort studies in the United States, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Both studies enroll older individuals and exclude participants with signs of dementia at baseline. From our analysis of 1325 participants of European ancestry who had genotype and neuropathologically assessed cerebral atherosclerosis measures available, we found a novel locus for cerebral atherosclerosis in NTNG1. The locus comprises eight SNPs, including two independent significant SNPs: rs6664221 (\u03b2 = -0.27, 95% CI = (-0.35, -0.19), p = 1.29 \u00d7 10-10) and rs10881463 (\u03b2 = -0.20, 95% CI = (-0.27, -0.13), p = 3.40 \u00d7 10-8). We further found that the SNPs may influence cerebral atherosclerosis by regulating brain protein expression of CNOT3.

Thus far, these investigations have largely been restricted to bottom-up approaches, hindering the degree to which one can characterize a protein's \"intact\" state. Top-down proteomics (TDP) overcomes this limitation; however, it is typically limited to observing only the most abundant proteoforms and of a relatively small size. Therefore, fractionation techniques are commonly used to reduce sample complexity. Here, we investigate gas-phase fractionation through high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) within TDP. Utilizing a high complexity sample derived from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, we describe how the addition of FAIMS to TDP can robustly improve the depth of proteome coverage. For example, implementation of FAIMS with external compensation voltage (CV) stepping at -50, -40, and -30 CV could more than double the mean number of non-redundant proteoforms, genes, and proteome sequence coverage compared to without FAIMS. We also found that FAIMS can influence the transmission of proteoforms and their charge envelopes based on their size. Importantly, FAIMS enabled the identification of intact amyloid beta (A\u03b2) proteoforms, including the aggregation-prone A\u03b21-42 variant which is strongly linked to AD.

Within a test dataset lacking transcriptomic data, traditional two-stage TWAS methods first impute gene expression by creating a weighted sum that aggregates SNPs with their corresponding cis-eQTL effects on reference transcriptome. Traditional TWAS methods then employ a linear regression model to assess the association between imputed gene expression and test phenotype, thereby assuming the effect of a cis-eQTL SNP on test phenotype is a linear function of the eQTL's estimated effect on reference transcriptome. To increase TWAS robustness to this assumption, we propose a novel Variance-Component TWAS procedure (VC-TWAS) that assumes the effects of cis-eQTL SNPs on phenotype are random (with variance proportional to corresponding reference cis-eQTL effects) rather than fixed. VC-TWAS is applicable to both continuous and dichotomous phenotypes, as well as individual-level and summary-level GWAS data. Using simulated data, we show VC-TWAS is more powerful than traditional TWAS methods based on a two-stage Burden test, especially when eQTL genetic effects on test phenotype are no longer a linear function of their eQTL genetic effects on reference transcriptome. We further applied VC-TWAS to both individual-level (N = ~3.4K) and summary-level (N = ~54K) GWAS data to study Alzheimer's dementia (AD). With the individual-level data, we detected 13 significant risk genes including 6 known GWAS risk genes such as TOMM40 that were missed by traditional TWAS methods. With the summary-level data, we detected 57 significant risk genes considering only cis-SNPs and 71 significant genes considering both cis- and trans- SNPs, which also validated our findings with the individual-level GWAS data.

Regression models adjusting for demographic and pathologic variables showed that altered levels of these protein species explained 7.7% additional between-subject variance in cognition (more than any individual age-related neuropathology in the model), suggesting that these molecules constitute key elements of brain reserve. Network analyses indicated that those peptides associated with brain reserve, and closest to the SNARE fusogenic activity, showed greater centrality measures and were better connected in the network. Validation assays confirmed the selective loss of the STX1A (but not STX1B) isoform in cognitively impaired cases. In rodent and human brains, STX1A was selectively located at glutamatergic terminals. However, in AD brains, STX1A was redistributed adjacent to neuritic pathology, and markedly expressed in astrocytes. Our study provides strong evidence, indicating that select presynaptic proteins are key in maintaining brain reserve. Compromised ability to sustain expression levels of these proteins may trigger synaptic dysfunction and concomitant cognitive impairment.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Alternative splicing", "Alzheimer's

The identified pQTLs tend to be non-synonymous variation, are over-represented among variants associated with brain diseases, and replicate well (77%) in an independent brain dataset. Comparison to a large study of brain eQTLs revealed that about 75% of pQTLs are also eQTLs. In contrast, about 40% of eQTLs were identified as pQTLs. These results are consistent with lower pQTL mapping power and greater evolutionary constraint on protein abundance. The latter is additionally supported by observations of pQTLs with large effects' tending to be rare, deleterious, and associated with proteins that have evidence for fewer protein-protein interactions. Mediation analyses using matched transcriptomic and proteomic data provided additional evidence that pQTL effects are often, but not always, mediated by mRNA. Specifically, we identified roughly 1.6 times more mRNA-mediated pQTLs than mRNA-independent pQTLs (550 versus 341).

It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks-which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples-for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66-108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p < 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p < 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.", "Keywords": ["aging", "biomarkers", "dementia", "epigenetics", "neurology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francine", "Last Name": "Grodstein", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bernardo", "Last Name": "Lemos", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Artemis", "Last Name": "Iatrou", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33446646", "Title": "A cortical immune network map identifies distinct microglial transcriptional programs associated with \u03b2-amyloid and Tau pathologies.", "Abstract": "Microglial dysfunction has been proposed as one of the many cellular mechanisms that can contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Genetic variants that modulate the expression of potential drug targets can be utilized to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. We therefore employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) on gene expression measured in brain tissue to identify drug targets involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We conducted a two-sample MR using cis-acting brain-derived expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease consortium (AMP-AD) and the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) meta-analysis study (n = 1,286) as genetic instruments to predict the effects of 7,137 genes on 12 neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conducted Bayesian colocalization analysis on the top MR findings (using P<6x10-7 as evidence threshold, Bonferroni-corrected for 80,557 MR tests) to confirm sharing of the same causal variants between gene expression and trait in each genomic region. We then intersected the colocalized genes with known monogenic disease genes recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and with genes annotated as drug targets in the Open Targets platform to identify promising drug targets. 80 eQTLs showed MR evidence of a causal effect, from which we prioritised 47 genes based on colocalization with the trait. We causally linked the expression of 23 genes with schizophrenia and a single gene each with anorexia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder within the psychiatric diseases and 9 genes with Alzheimer's disease, 6 genes with Parkinson's disease, 4 genes with multiple sclerosis and two genes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within the neurological diseases we tested.

Substantial amounts of BDNF are present in peripheral blood, and may serve as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease incidence as well as targets for intervention to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk. With the exception of the genetic polymorphism in the BDNF gene, Val66Met, which has been extensively studied with regard to neurodegenerative diseases, the genetic variation that influences circulating BDNF levels is unknown. We aimed to explore the genetic determinants of circulating BDNF levels in order to clarify its mechanistic involvement in brain structure and function and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in middle-aged and old adults. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study of circulating BDNF in 11 785 middle- and old-aged individuals of European ancestry from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Rotterdam Study and the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend). Furthermore, we performed functional annotation analysis and related the genetic polymorphism influencing circulating BDNF to common Alzheimer's disease pathologies from brain autopsies. Mendelian randomization was conducted to examine the possible causal role of circulating BDNF levels with various phenotypes including cognitive function, stroke, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, physical activity and diet patterns. Gene interaction networks analysis was also performed. The estimated heritability of BDNF levels was 30% (standard error\u2009=\u20090.0246, P-value\u2009=\u20094 \u00d7 10-48). We identified seven novel independent loci mapped near the BDNF gene and in BRD3, CSRNP1, KDELC2, RUNX1 (two single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and BDNF-AS. The expression of BDNF was associated with neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissues from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Seven additional genes (ACAT1, ATM, NPAT, WDR48, TTC21A, SCN114 and COX7B) were identified through expression and protein quantitative trait loci analyses. Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a potential causal role of BDNF in cardioembolism. Lastly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis placed circulating BDNF levels in four major networks. Our study provides novel insights into genes and molecular pathways associated with circulating BDNF levels and highlights the possible involvement of plaque instability as an underlying mechanism linking BDNF with brain neurodegeneration.

Here, we investigate the population structure of live microglia purified from human cerebral cortex samples obtained at autopsy and during neurosurgical procedures. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we find that some subsets are enriched for disease-related genes and RNA signatures. We confirm the presence of four of these microglial subpopulations histologically and illustrate the utility of our data by characterizing further microglial cluster 7, enriched for genes depleted in the cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histologically, these cluster 7 microglia are reduced in frequency in AD tissue, and we validate this observation in an independent set of single nucleus data. Thus, our live human microglia identify a range of subtypes, and we prioritize one of these as being altered in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female",

Here we develop a temporal model for these unobserved molecular changes with a manifold learning method applied to RNA-Seq data collected from human postmortem brain samples collected within the ROS/MAP and Mayo Clinic RNA-Seq studies. We define an ordering across samples based on their similarity in gene expression and use this ordering to estimate the molecular disease stage-or disease pseudotime-for each sample. Disease pseudotime is strongly concordant with the burden of tau (Braak score, P\u2009=\u20091.0 \u00d7 10-5), A\u03b2 (CERAD score, P\u2009=\u20091.8 \u00d7 10-5), and cognitive diagnosis (P\u2009=\u20093.5 \u00d7 10-7) of late-onset (LO)\u00a0AD. Early stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for controls and show changes in basic cellular functions. Late stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for late stage AD cases and show changes in neuroinflammation and amyloid pathologic processes. We also identify a set of late stage pseudotime samples that are controls and show changes in genes enriched for protein trafficking, splicing, regulation of apoptosis, and prevention of amyloid cleavage pathways.

Due to the computational burden, existing TWAS methods do not assess distant trans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are known to explain important expression variation for most genes. We propose a Bayesian genome-wide TWAS (BGW-TWAS) method that leverages both cis- and trans-eQTL information for a TWAS. Our BGW-TWAS method is based on Bayesian variable selection regression, which not only accounts for cis- and trans-eQTL of the target gene but also enables efficient computation by using summary statistics from standard eQTL analyses. Our simulation studies illustrated that BGW-TWASs achieved higher power compared to existing TWAS methods that do not assess trans-eQTL information. We further applied BWG-TWAS to individual-level GWAS data (N = \u223c3.3K), which identified significant associations between the genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) of ZC3H12B and Alzheimer dementia (AD) (p value = 5.42\u00a0\u00d7 10-13), neurofibrillary tangle density (p value = 1.89\u00a0\u00d7 10-6), and global measure of AD pathology (p value = 9.59\u00a0\u00d7 10-7). These associations for ZC3H12B were completely driven by trans-eQTL. Additionally, the GReX of KCTD12 was found to be significantly associated with \u03b2-amyloid (p value = 3.44\u00a0\u00d7 10-8) which was driven by both cis- and trans-eQTL. Four of the top driven trans-eQTL of ZC3H12B are located within APOC1, a known major risk gene of AD and blood lipids. Additionally, by applying BGW-TWAS with summary-level GWAS data of AD (N = \u223c54K), we identified 13 significant genes including known GWAS risk genes HLA-DRB1 and APOC1, as well as ZC3H12B.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer dementia", "Bayesian variable selection model", "TWAS", "cis-eQTL", "summary statistics", "trans-eQTL", "transcriptome-wide association study"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein C-I", "Bayes Theorem", "Case-Control Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Markers", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "HLA-DRB1 Chains", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Proteins", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Ribonucleases", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin M", "Last Name": "Luningham", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Georgia State University School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA; Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junyu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shizhen", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Emory University School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aron S", "Last Name": "Buchman", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.

However, the metabolic perturbation behind the onset of AD remains unclear. In this study, we performed metabolite profiling in both brain (n\u2009=\u2009109) and matching serum samples (n\u2009=\u2009566) to identify differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with neuropathology and cognitive performance and to identify individuals at high risk of developing cognitive impairment. The abundances of 6 metabolites, glycolithocholate (GLCA), petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and the deoxycholate/cholate (DCA/CA) ratio, along with the dysregulation scores of 3 metabolic pathways, primary bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed significant differences across both brain and serum diagnostic groups (P-value\u2009<\u20090.05). Significant associations were observed between the levels of differential metabolites/pathways and cognitive performance, neurofibrillary tangles, and\u00a0neuritic plaque burden. Metabolites abundances and personalized metabolic pathways scores were used to derive machine learning models, respectively, that could be used to differentiate cognitively impaired persons from those without cognitive impairment (median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)\u2009=\u20090.772 for the metabolite level model; median AUC\u2009=\u20090.731 for the pathway level model). Utilizing these two models on the entire baseline control group, we identified those who experienced cognitive decline in the later years (AUC\u2009=\u20090.804, sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.722, specificity\u2009=\u20090.749 for the metabolite level model; AUC\u2009=\u20090.778, sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.633, specificity\u2009=\u20090.825 for the pathway level model) and demonstrated their pre-AD onset prediction potentials.

Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulations can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Computational Biology", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Organ Specificity", "Phenotype", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ellis", "Last Name": "Patrick", "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ayla", "Last Name": "Ergun", "Affiliation": "Research and Development, Biogen, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bernard", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Casazza", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Cimpean", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christina", "Last Name": "Yung", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Gaiteri", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32769139", "Title": "Association of social network structure and physical function in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "Abstract": "To test the association between physical function and the social environment in multiple sclerosis (MS), we quantified personal social networks.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Social Environment", "Social Networking"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seth N", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "From the Multiple Sclerosis Center and the Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology (S.N.L., C.S.R., C.N., L.S., K.O., V.M.L., L.L., R.S.F., W.S.V., P.L.D.J.), and The Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease Research (P.L.D.J.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY;

In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these profiles have been applied to the target organ: the aging brain. In a growing number of cases, the same samples were profiled with multiple different approaches, yielding genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. Here, we review lessons learned so far as we move beyond quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses which map the effect of genetic variation on molecular features to integrate multiple levels of \"omic\" data in an effort to identify the molecular drivers of AD. One thing is clear: no single layer of molecular or \"omic\" data is sufficient to capture the variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence using different approaches. Thus, we are on the cusp of an acceleration of truly integrative studies as the availability of large numbers of well-characterized brain samples profiled in three or more dimensions enables the testing, comparison and refinement of analytic methods with which to dissect the molecular architecture of the aging brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer", "epigenome", "integrative analysis", "multi-omic", "proteome", "transcriptome"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Computational Biology", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Proteomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32637632", "Title": "Synonymous variants associated with Alzheimer disease in multiplex families.", "Abstract": "Synonymous variants can lead to disease; nevertheless, the majority of sequencing studies conducted in Alzheimer disease (AD) only assessed coding variation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain (M.E.A., B.V., R.L., P.L.J., R.M., I.S.-M., C.R.); The Gertrude H.

modules in the aging human brain; we discover and replicate such variants in the TMEM106B and RBFOX1 loci. The TMEM106B haplotype is known to influence the accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43\u00a0kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, and the haplotype's large-scale transcriptomic effects include the dysregulation of lysosomal genes and alterations in synaptic gene splicing that are also seen in the pathophysiology of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Further, a variant near GRN, another TDP-43 proteinopathy susceptibility gene, shows concordant effects with the TMEM106B haplotype. Leveraging neuropathology data from the same participants, we also show that TMEM106B and APOE-amyloid-\u03b2 effects converge to alter myelination and lysosomal gene expression, which then contributes to TDP-43 accumulation. These results advance our mechanistic understanding of the TMEM106B TDP-43 risk haplotype and uncover a transcriptional program that mediates the converging effects of APOE-amyloid-\u03b2 and TMEM106B on TDP-43 aggregation in older adults.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "GRN", "RBFOX1", "TDP-43", "TMEM106B", "co-expression module", "cognitive resilience", "eQTL", "expression quantitative trait loci", "sQTL", "splicing quantitative trait loci"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Myelin Sheath", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Progranulins", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "RNA Splicing Factors", "TDP-43 Proteinopathies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hyun-Sik", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA;

However, these variants only explain part of the heritability of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As genetic epistasis can be a major contributor to the \"missing heritability\" of AD, we conducted genome-wide epistasis screening for AD pathologies in 2 independent cohorts. First, we performed a genome-wide epistasis study of AD-related brain pathologies (Nmax\u00a0= 1318) in ROS/MAP. Candidate interactions were validated using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD in ADNI (Nmax\u00a0= 1128). Further functional analysis tested the association of candidate interactions with neuroimaging phenotypes. For tau and amyloid-\u03b2 pathology, we identified 2803 and 464 candidate SNP-SNP interactions, respectively. Associations of candidate SNP-SNP interactions with brain volume and white matter changes from neuroimages provides additional insights into their molecular functions. Transcriptional analysis supported possible gene-gene interactions identified by statistical screening through their co-expression in the brain. In summary, we outlined an exhaustive epistasis analysis to identify novel genetic interactions with potential roles in AD pathologies.

diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: myeloid cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation and synaptic signaling. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1 transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Bayes Theorem", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Differentiation", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Sch\u00e4fer", "Affiliation": "Mathematical Institute, Heinrich Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Holger", "Last Name": "Schwender", "Affiliation": "Mathematical Institute, Heinrich Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "32047652", "Title": "Brain microRNAs associated with late-life depressive symptoms are also associated with cognitive trajectory and dementia.", "Abstract": "Late-life depression is associated with an increased risk for dementia but we have limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this association.

Late-life depressive symptoms were assessed annually in 300 participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project for a mean of 7 years. Participants underwent annual cognitive testing, clinical assessment of cognitive status, and uniform neuropathologic examination after death. microRNAs were profiled from the prefrontal cortex using NanoString platform in the discovery cohort and small RNA sequencing in the replication cohort. A global microRNA association study of late-life depressive symptoms was performed using linear mixed model adjusting for the potential confounding factors. Four brain microRNAs were associated with late-life depressive symptoms at adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.05: miR-484, miR-26b-5p, miR-30d-5p, and miR-197-3p. Lower expression levels of these miRNAs were associated having greater depressive symptoms. Furthermore, lower levels of miR-484 and miR-197-3p were associated with faster decline of cognition over time. Moreover, lower miR-484 level was associated with higher probability of having Alzheimer's dementia. Importantly, the associations between miR-484 and depressive symptoms and Alzheimer's dementia, respectively, were replicated in an independent cohort. Lastly, the predicted targets of miR-484 were enriched in a brain protein co-expression module involving synaptic transmission and regulation of synaptic plasticity.

HHV-6 demonstrated little specificity to AD brains over controls by either method, whereas other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), were detected at comparable levels.

Our current understanding of MS genetics can explain up to half of the disease's heritability, raising the important question of whether this is enough information to leverage toward improving diagnosis in MS. Parallel advancements in technologies that allow the characterization of the full transcriptome down to the single-cell level have enabled the generation of an unprecedented wealth of information.

In rodents, sleep disruption causes microglial activation, inhibition of which improves cognition. However, data from humans are lacking. We studied participants in two cohort studies of older persons-the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. We assessed sleep fragmentation by actigraphy and related this to cognitive function, to neocortical microglial marker gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, and to the neocortical density of microglia assessed by immunohistochemistry. Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with higher neocortical expression of genes characteristic of aged microglia, and a higher proportion of morphologically activated microglia, independent of chronological age- and dementia-related neuropathologies. Furthermore, these were, in turn, associated with worse cognition.

Higher NRP1 expression correlated with worse outcomes among \u03b54 carriers but better outcomes among \u03b54 noncarriers, suggesting NRP1 modifies the risk for poor cognitive scores based on APOE-\u03b54 status.

These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all environmental confounding.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Body

We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets underlying brain development and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Brain", "Cohort Studies",

are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The exact role of microglia in CNS disorders is not clear due to lack of tools to discriminate between microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here, we present a novel reporter mouse model targeting a microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, for studying microglia in health and disease. By placing a reporter cassette (GSG-3xFlag-P2A-tdTomato) between the coding sequence of exon 2 and 3'UTR of the Tmem119 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a Tmem119-tdTomato knock-in mouse strain. Gene expression assay showed no difference of endogenous Tmem119 in the CNS of Tmem119tdTomato/+ relative to wild-type mice. The cells expressing tdTomato were recognized by immunofluorescence staining using commercially available anti-TMEM119 antibodies. Additionally, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry techniques revealed that tdTomato+ cells are detected throughout the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues of Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Aging does not influence TMEM119 expression as tdTomato+ cells were detectable in the CNS of older mice (300 and 540\u202fdays old). Further immunofluorescence characterization shows that tdTomato+ cells colocalize with Iba1+ cells in the brain, but not with neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of brain tissues of adult mice demonstrates that the majority of microglia CD45loCD11b+ cells (96.3%) are tdTomato-positive; and a minority of infiltrating CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (5.3%) are also tdTomato-positive, which we further characterized and found that tdTomato expression is in part of choroid plexus macrophages but not in meningeal and perivascular macrophages. Functionally, using an acute injury model, we measured time-lapse activation of tdTomato-labeled microglia by transcranial two-photon microscopy in live Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Taken together, the Tmem119-tdTomato reporter mouse model is a valuable tool to specifically study the role of microglia in health and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Female", "Genes, Reporter", "Luminescent Proteins", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microglia", "Models, Animal", "Red Fluorescent Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunsheng", "Last Name": "Ruan", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linlin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Kroshilina", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lien", "Last Name": "Beckers", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Hasson", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA; Amgen Research, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We test the hypothesis that Tau-spliceosome interactions disrupt pre-mRNA splicing in AD. In human postmortem brain with AD pathology, Tau coimmunoprecipitates with spliceosomal components. In Drosophila, pan-neuronal Tau expression triggers reductions in multiple core and U1-specific spliceosomal proteins, and genetic disruption of these factors, including SmB, U1-70K, and U1A, enhances Tau-mediated neurodegeneration. We further show that loss of function in SmB, encoding a core spliceosomal protein, causes decreased survival, progressive locomotor impairment, and neuronal loss, independent of Tau toxicity.

However, the degree to which genetic risk of Alzheimer's dementia contributes to late-life motor impairment, and the specific molecular systems underlying these associations, are uncertain. Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omic approach to assess genetic influence on motor impairment in older adults and identified key molecular pathways that may mediate this risk. We built a polygenic risk score for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) and examined its relationship to several motor phenotypes in 1885 older individuals from two longitudinal aging cohorts. We found that AD-PRS was associated with a previously validated composite motor scores and their components. The major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's dementia, the APOE/TOMM40 locus, was not a major driver of these associations. To identify specific molecular features that potentially medicate the genetic risk into motor dysfunction, we examined brain multi-omics, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, histone acetylation (H3K9AC), and targeted proteomics, as well as diverse neuropathologies. We found that a small number of factors account for the majority of the influence of AD-PRS on motor function, which comprises paired helical filament tau-tangle density, H3K9AC in specific chromosomal regions encoding genes involved in neuromuscular process.

Both cell types can adopt diverse functional states that play critical roles in lesion formation and resolution. In order to identify phenotypic subsets of myeloid cells and astrocytes, we profiled two active MS lesions with thirteen glial activation markers using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a method for multiplexed labeling of histological sections. In the acutely demyelinating lesion, we found multiple distinct myeloid and astrocyte phenotypes that populated separate lesion zones. In the post-demyelinating lesion, phenotypes were less distinct and more uniformly distributed. In both lesions cell-to-cell interactions were not random, but occurred between specific glial subpopulations and lymphocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that myeloid, but not astrocyte phenotypes were activated along a lesion rim-to-center gradient, and that marker expression in glial cells at the lesion rim was driven more by cell-extrinsic factors than in cells at the center. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that highly multiplexed tissue imaging, combined with the appropriate computational tools, is a powerful approach to study heterogeneity, spatial distribution and cellular interactions in the context of MS lesions. Identifying glial phenotypes and their interactions at different lesion stages may provide novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting acute demyelination and low-grade, chronic inflammation.", "Keywords": ["Astrocytes", "Imaging mass cytometry", "Macrophages", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiplexed tissue imaging", "Single-cell analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Astrocytes", "Cell Communication", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Myeloid Cells", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Calvin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, Suite 353I, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gerald", "Last Name": "Ponath", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, Suite 353I, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maya", "Last Name": "Levine-Ritterman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, Suite 353I, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Bull", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, Suite 353I, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric C", "Last Name": "Swanson", "Affiliation": "Fluidigm Corporation, Markham, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin M", "Last Name": "Segal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, Suite 353I, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. david.pitt@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2019Aug12"}, {"PMID": "31404102", "Title": "Cognition may link cortical IGFBP5 levels with motor function in older adults.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may manifest cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes including motor impairment, suggesting a shared underlying biology.

Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss.

By using the gene expression imputation models fitted from reference datasets that have both genetic and transcriptomic data, TWASs facilitate gene-based tests with GWAS data while accounting for the reference transcriptomic data. The existing TWAS tools like PrediXcan and FUSION use parametric imputation models that have limitations for modeling the complex genetic architecture of transcriptomic data. Therefore, to improve on this, we employ a nonparametric Bayesian method that was originally proposed for genetic prediction of complex traits, which assumes a data-driven nonparametric prior for cis-eQTL effect sizes. The nonparametric Bayesian method is flexible and general because it includes both of the parametric imputation models used by PrediXcan and FUSION as special cases. Our simulation studies showed that the nonparametric Bayesian model improved both imputation R2 for transcriptomic data and the TWAS power over PrediXcan when \u22651% cis-SNPs co-regulate gene expression and gene expression heritability \u22640.2. In real applications, the nonparametric Bayesian method fitted transcriptomic imputation models for 57.8% more genes over PrediXcan, thus improving the power of follow-up TWASs.

We conducted GWAS of DSM-IV AD (primary analysis), DSM-IV AD criterion count (secondary analysis), and individual dependence criteria (tertiary analysis) among 7418 (1121 families) European American (EA) individuals from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). Trans-ancestral meta-analyses combined these results with data from 3175 (585 families) African-American (AA) individuals from COGA. In the EA GWAS, three loci were genome-wide significant: rs1229984 in ADH1B for AD criterion count (P = 4.16E-11) and Desire to cut drinking (P = 1.21E-11); rs188227250 (chromosome 8, Drinking more than intended, P = 6.72E-09); rs1912461 (chromosome 15, Time spent drinking, P = 1.77E-08). In the trans-ancestral meta-analysis, rs1229984 was associated with multiple phenotypes and two additional loci were genome-wide significant: rs61826952 (chromosome 1, DSM-IV AD, P = 8.42E-11); rs7597960 (chromosome 2, Time spent drinking, P = 1.22E-08). Associations with rs1229984 and rs18822750 were replicated in independent datasets. Polygenic risk scores derived from the EA GWAS of AD predicted AD in two EA datasets (P\u2009<\u2009.01; 0.61%-1.82% of variance). Identified novel variants (ie, rs1912461, rs61826952) were associated with differential central evoked theta power (loss - gain; P = .0037) and reward-related ventral striatum reactivity (P = .008), respectively.

activation in elderly human brain.", "Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have important roles in brain health. However, little is known about the regulation and consequences of microglial activation in the aging human brain. Here we report that the proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) in postmortem cortical tissue is strongly associated with \u03b2-amyloid, tau-related neuropathology, and the rate of cognitive decline. Effect sizes for PAM measures are substantial, comparable to that of APOE \u03b54, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and mediation models support an upstream role for microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease via accumulation of tau. Further, we identify a common variant (rs2997325) influencing PAM that also affects in vivo microglial activation measured by [11C]-PBR28 PET in an independent cohort.

investigating the pathophysiological processes that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia have identified an increasing number of susceptibility genes, many of which are poorly characterized and have not previously been implicated in AD. Here, we evaluated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and astrocytes as tools to systematically test AD-relevant cellular phenotypes following perturbation of candidate genes identified by genome-wide studies. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used to modulate expression of 66 genes in astrocytes and 52 genes in induced neurons. Five genes (CNN2, GBA, GSTP1, MINT2 and FERMT2) in neurons and nine genes (CNN2, ITGB1, MINT2, SORL1, VLDLR, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SCARB2) in astrocytes significantly altered extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels. Knockdown of AP3M2, CNN2, GSTP1, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SORL1 reduced interleukin-6 levels in astrocytes. Only knockdown of FERMT2 led to a reduction in the proportion of TAU that is phosphorylated. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of FERMT2 in both familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected human neurons validated the findings of reduced extracellular A\u03b2. Interestingly, FERMT2 reduction had no effect on the A\u03b242:40 ratio in corrected neurons and a reduction of phospho-tau, but resulted in an elevation in A\u03b242:40 ratio and no reduction in phospho-tau in fAD neurons. Taken together, this study has prioritized 15 genes as being involved in contributing to A\u03b2 accumulation, phosphorylation of tau and/or cytokine secretion, and, as illustrated with FERMT2, it sets the stage for further cell-type-specific dissection of the role of these genes in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Astrocytes", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cell Line", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Targeting", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neurons", "Phenotype", "Proteostasis", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meichen", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert V", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina N", "Last Name": "Lagomarsino", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jishu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Cell Circuits Program, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Cell Circuits Program, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Young-Pearse", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2019Mar01"}, {"PMID": "30349450", "Title": "The Molecular and Neuropathological Consequences of Genetic Risk for Alzheimer's Dementia.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's dementia commonly impacts the health of older adults and lacks any preventative therapy. While Alzheimer's dementia risk has a substantial genetic component, the specific molecular mechanisms and neuropathologies triggered by most of the known genetic variants are unclear. Resultantly, they have shown limited influence on drug development portfolios to date. To facilitate our understanding of the consequences of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility variants, we examined their relationship to a wide range of clinical, molecular and neuropathological features. Because the effect size of individual variants is typically small, we utilized a polygenic (overall) risk approach to identify the global impact of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility variants. Under this approach, each individual has a polygenic risk score (PRS) that we related to clinical, molecular and neuropathological phenotypes. Applying this approach to 1,272 individuals who came to autopsy from one of two longitudinal aging cohorts, we observed that an individual's PRS was associated with cognitive decline and brain pathologies including beta-amyloid, tau-tangles, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43, MIR132, four proteins including VGF, IGFBP5, and STX1A, and many chromosomal regions decorated with acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Ac). While excluding the APOE/TOMM40 region (containing the single largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's dementia) in the calculation of the PRS resulted in a slightly weaker association with the molecular signatures, results remained significant. These PRS-associated brain pathologies and molecular signatures appear to mediate genetic risk, as they attenuated the association of the PRS with cognitive decline. Notably, the PRS induced changes in H3K9Ac throughout the genome, implicating it in large-scale chromatin changes. Thus, the PRS for Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) showed effects on diverse clinical, molecular, and pathological systems, ranging from the epigenome to specific proteins. These convergent targets of a large number of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's dementia will help define the experimental systems and models needed to test therapeutic targets, which are expected to be broadly effective in the aging population that carries diverse genetic risks for Alzheimer's dementia.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "PheWAS", "brain pathology", "epigenome", "lifestyle", "multi omics", "personality", "polygenic risk score"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Tasaki", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Gaiteri", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30337151", "Title": "Altered bile acid profile associates with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease-An emerging role for gut microbiome.", "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and a specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration.

Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects: splicing of 3,006 genes is influenced by genetic variation. We report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study and identified 21 genes with significant associations with Alzheimer's disease, many of which are found in known loci, whereas 8 are in novel loci. These results highlight the convergence of old and new genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways.

As we begin to understand the impact of these genomic features in each disease, we also appreciate that many aging individuals accumulate each of these pathologies without fulfilling criteria for syndromic diagnoses, that other pathologies are common in individuals with a given diagnosis, and that there may be shared protective factors against central nervous system injury.

Therefore, with the ultimate goal of understanding molecular systems associated with cognitive decline, we infer directed interactions among regulatory elements in the local regulatory vicinity of individual genes based on brain multi-omics data from 413 individuals. These local regulatory networks (LRNs) capture the influences of genetics and epigenetics on gene expression in older adults. LRNs were confirmed through correspondence to known transcription biophysics. To relate LRNs to age-related neurologic diseases, we then incorporate common neuropathologies and measures of cognitive decline into this framework. This step identifies a specific set of largely neuronal genes, such as STAU1 and SEMA3F, predicted to control cognitive decline in older adults. These predictions are validated in separate cohorts by comparison to genetic associations for general cognition.

Previously we examined how DNA alleles control downstream expression of RNA transcripts and how those relationships are changed in late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We have now examined how proteins are incorporated into networks in two separate series and evaluated our outputs in two different cell lines. Our pipeline included the following steps: (i) predicting expression quantitative trait loci; (ii) determining differential expression; (iii) analysing networks of transcript and peptide relationships; and (iv) validating effects in two separate cell lines. We performed all our analysis in two separate brain series to validate effects. Our two series included 345 samples in the first set (177 controls, 168 cases; age range 65&ndash;105; 58&percnt; female; KRONOSII cohort) and 409 samples in the replicate set (153 controls, 141 cases, 115 mild cognitive impairment; age range 66&ndash;107; 63&percnt; female; RUSH cohort). Our top target is heat shock protein family A member 2 (HSPA2), which was identified as a key driver in our two datasets. HSPA2 was validated in two cell lines, with overexpression driving further elevation of amyloid-&beta;40 and amyloid-&beta;42 levels in APP mutant cells, as well as significant elevation of microtubule associated protein tau and phosphorylated-tau in a modified neuroglioma line. This work further demonstrates that studying changes in gene and protein expression is crucial to understanding late onset disease and further nominates HSPA2 as a specific key regulator of late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease processes.10.1093/brain/awy215_video1awy215media15824729224001.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cell Line", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "HEK293 Cells", "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "RNA", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vladislav A", "Last Name": "Petyuk", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division and Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Ramirez-Restrepo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Noam D", "Last Name": "Beckmann", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc Y R", "Last Name": "Henrion", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Piehowski", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division and Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kuixi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sven", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Food Science and Technology Department, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Huentelman", "Affiliation": "Neurogenomics Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division and Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Andreev", "Affiliation": "Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, 340 E Huron St #

Although there are sex differences in AD risk, sex differences have not been evaluated in genetic studies of AD endophenotypes. We performed sex-stratified and sex interaction genetic analyses of CSF biomarkers to identify sex-specific associations. Data came from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF A\u03b242 and tau (1527 males, 1509 females). We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In A\u03b242, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: rs316341 within SERPINB1 (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and rs13115400 near LINC00290 (p\u2009=\u20090.002).

In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, rs1393060 proximal to GMNC (p\u2009=\u20090.004), driven by a stronger association among females (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.05, p\u2009=\u20094.57\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10) compared to males (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u20090.03).

Integrating studies of human postmortem brain tissue and Drosophila melanogaster models, we investigate TE activation in association with Tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Leveraging RNA sequencing from 636 human brains, we discover differential expression for several retrotransposons in association with neurofibrillary tangle burden and highlight evidence for global TE transcriptional activation among the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and endogenous retrovirus clades. In addition, we detect Tau-associated, active chromatin signatures at multiple HERV-Fc1 genomic loci. To determine whether Tau is sufficient to induce\u00a0TE activation, we profile retrotransposons in Drosophila expressing human wild-type or mutant Tau throughout the brain.

We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N\u2009=\u2009300,486; age 16-102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognition", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gail", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Max", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, 539747, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Joey W", "Last Name": "Trampush", "Affiliation": "BrainWorkup, LLC, Los Angeles, 90033, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Luciano", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "W David", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Saskia P", "Last Name": "Hagenaars", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stuart J", "Last Name": "Ritchie", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo E", "Last Name": "Marioni", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Chloe", "Last Name": "Fawns-Ritchie", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "David C M", "Last Name": "Liewald", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Judith A", "Last Name": "Okely", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9JZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ari V", "Last Name": "Ahola-Olli", "Affiliation": "Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, 20520, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Catriona L K", "Last Name": "Barnes", "Affiliation": "Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, Scotland."}, {"First Name": "Lars", "Last Name": "Bertram", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, 14195, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Joshua C", "Last Name": "Bis", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, 98101, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Burdick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, 10029, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Christoforou", "Affiliation": "NORMENT, K.G.

Here we report the construction and validation of a molecular network of the aging human frontal cortex. Using RNA sequence data from 478 individuals, we first build a molecular network using modules of coexpressed genes and then relate these modules to AD and its neuropathologic and cognitive endophenotypes. We confirm these associations in two independent AD datasets. We also illustrate the use of the network in prioritizing amyloid- and cognition-associated genes for in vitro validation in human neurons and astrocytes. These analyses based on unique cohorts enable us to resolve the role of distinct cortical modules that have a direct effect on the accumulation of AD pathology from those that have a direct effect on cognitive decline, exemplifying a network approach to complex diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Astrocytes", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Association Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Gaiteri", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Tasaki", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jishu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellis", "Last Name": "Patrick", "Affiliation": "University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Vitalina", "Last Name": "Komashko", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristin", "Last Name": "McCabe", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Root", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aviv", "Last Name": "Regev", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori B", "Last Name": "Chibnik", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Young-Pearse", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA. david_a_bennett@rush.edu."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA. pld2115@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jun"}, {"PMID": "29801024", "Title": "Sex-Specific Association of Apolipoprotein E With Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Tau.", "Abstract": "The strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, has a stronger association among women compared with men.

The advent of low-cost, whole-genome sequencing facilitates high-resolution variant identification, and the development of linear mixed models (LMM) allows improved identification of putatively causal variants. While essential for correcting false positive associations due to sample relatedness and population stratification, LMMs have commonly been restricted to quantitative variables. However, phenotypic traits in association studies are often categorical, coded as binary case-control or ordered variables describing disease stages. To address these issues, we have devised a method for genomic association studies that implements a generalized LMM (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, called Bayes-GLMM Bayes-GLMM has four major features: (1) support of categorical, binary, and quantitative variables; (2) cohesive integration of previous GWAS results for related traits; (3) correction for sample relatedness by mixed modeling; and (4) model estimation by both Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and maximal likelihood estimation. We applied Bayes-GLMM to the whole-genome sequencing cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. This study contains 570 individuals from 111 families, each with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed at one of four confidence levels. Using Bayes-GLMM we identified four variants in three loci significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two variants, rs140233081 and rs149372995, lie between PRKAR1B and PDGFA The coded proteins are localized to the glial-vascular unit, and PDGFA transcript levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathology. In summary, this work provides implementation of a flexible, generalized mixed-model approach in a Bayesian framework for association studies.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "genome-wide association", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Bayes Theorem", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Markov Chains", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Monte Carlo Method", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xulong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609."}, {"First Name": "Vivek M", "Last Name": "Philip", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609."}, {"First Name": "Guruprasad", "Last Name": "Ananda", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut 06032."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142."}, {"First Name": "Ankit", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut 06032."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Michalski", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut 06032."}, {"First Name": "Krishna R Murthy", "Last Name": "Karuturi", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut 06032."}, {"First Name": "Sumana R", "Last Name": "Chintalapudi", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609."}, {"First Name": "Casey", "Last Name": "Acklin", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Sasner", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142."}, {"First Name": "Gareth R", "Last Name": "Howell", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609 gareth.howell@jax.org greg.carter@jax.org."}, {"First Name": "Gregory W", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609 gareth.howell@jax.org greg.carter@jax.org."}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "29498610", "Title": "What is the epigenome and is it involved in multiple sclerosis?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Multiple sclerosis", "epidemiology", "genetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ji Y", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA/Center for Cell Circuits, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA/Center for Cell Circuits, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)", "PubDate": "2018Mar"}, {"PMID": "29416036", "Title": "A transcriptomic atlas of aged human microglia.", "Abstract": "With a rapidly aging global human population, finding a cure for late onset neurodegenerative diseases has become an urgent enterprise.

Our analytic protocol controlled for biographical variables (age, sex, education), psychological and health variables (depressive symptoms, interval between assessment and autopsy, slope of cognitive decline, AD pathology, presence of infarcts) and RNA integrity. Our results are based on a pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) at FDR-corrected q-values <0.05, using these collections from the Molecular Signatures Database (v6.0 MSigDB): (1) Hallmarks, (2) Canonical, (3) Gene Ontology (GO), (4) Chemical and Genetic Perturbations, (5) Immunologic Signatures, (6) Oncogenic Signatures, and (7) Cancer Modules. We now report on 337 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated gene sets, among which the most significant ones were associated with Alzheimer's disease, psychiatric illness, immune dysfunction, and cancer.

We developed an in vitro cell model system composed of human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells that recapitulated key aspects of microglia phenotype and function. We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells.

In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 \u00d7 10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 \u00d7 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 \u00d7 10-10, OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 \u00d7 10-14, OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease.

The extent to which this difference affects the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. We compared the APOE \u03b54-TOMM40 '523 haplotypes between older Caucasian and African Americans, and examined their relationship with AD dementia. Data came from three community based cohort studies of diverse participants. APOE genotypes were determined by polymorphisms of rs429358 and rs7412. TOMM40 '523 genotypes were defined by the poly-T repeat length of rs10524523 (short ['523-S]: poly-T \u2264 19, long ['523-L]: 20 \u2264 poly-T \u2264 29, and very long ['523-VL]: poly-T \u2265 30). Cox proportional hazards models examined the effect of haplotype variation on the risk of incident AD dementia. A total of 1,848 Caucasian and 540 African American individuals were included in the study. In Caucasians, nearly none (0.8%) of the non-\u03b54 carriers and almost all (94.2%) of the \u03b54 carriers had '523-L. The classification was highly concordant. Each \u03b54 allele doubled the risk for AD dementia and the dose effect was evident. Almost identical effect size and effect pattern were observed for TOMM40 '523-L. In African Americans, nearly none (1.1%) of the non-\u03b54 carriers had '523-L, but only 47.8% of the \u03b54 carriers had '523-L. The concordance was weaker compared with Caucasians. The effect patterns on incident AD dementia differed distinctively between \u03b54 and '523-L carriers.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (A\u03b242), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with A\u03b242 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.059, P\u00a0=\u00a02.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.025, P\u00a0=\u00a01.72\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.105, P\u00a0=\u00a03.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2), disease progression (GLIS1: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.277, P\u00a0=\u00a01.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.043, P\u00a0=\u00a04.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an A\u03b2-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF A\u03b242 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results.

Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200\u2009kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155). Our findings suggest novel biological pathways through which human genetic variation influences hippocampal volume and risk for neuropsychiatric illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glycoproteins", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Organ Size", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Derrek P", "Last Name": "Hibar", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hieab H H", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Neda", "Last Name": "Jahanshad", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "INSERM Unit U1219, University of Bordeaux, 33076 Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Jason L", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edith", "Last Name": "Hofer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Clinical Division of Neurogeriatrics, Medical University Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 22, 8036 Graz, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Miguel E", "Last Name": "Renteria", "Affiliation": "QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland 4006, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Joshua C", "Last Name": "Bis", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 1730 Minor Avenue/Suite 1360.

It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (\u03c1genetic = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Cognition", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Oncogene Protein v-akt", "Parkinson Disease", "Phenotype", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hieab H H", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Derrek P", "Last Name": "Hibar", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Chouraki", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason L", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Imaging Genetics Center, USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Nyquist", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Department of Anesthesia/Critical Care Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miguel E", "Last Name": "Renter\u00eda", "Affiliation": "QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stella", "Last Name": "Trompet", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Arias-Vasquez", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Sudha", "Last Name": "Seshadri", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sylvane", "Last Name": "Desrivi\u00e8res", "Affiliation": "MRC-SGDP Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ashley H", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "Dr. John T.

Prediction for Alzheimer's Disease.", "Abstract": "Effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires the development of risk prediction tools permitting preclinical intervention. We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models based on age, sex, education, and APOE\u025b4. In eight prospective cohorts included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia. Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models. Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index (\u0394-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a 17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR\u200a=\u200a1.17; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.13-1.21] per standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value\u200a= \u200a2.86\u00d710-16). This association was stronger among persons with at least one APOE\u025b4 allele (HRGRS\u200a=\u200a1.24; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.15-1.34]) than in others (HRGRS\u200a=\u200a1.13; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.08-1.18]; pinteraction\u200a=\u200a3.45\u00d710-2). Risk prediction after seven years of follow-up showed a small improvement when adding the GRS to age, sex, APOE\u025b4, and education (\u0394-Cindex\u200a= \u200a0.0043 [0.0019-0.0067]). Similar patterns were observed for IDI and NRI>0. In conclusion, a risk score incorporating common genetic variation outside the APOE\u025b4 locus improved AD risk prediction and may facilitate risk stratification for prevention trials.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "IGAP", "clinical utility", "cohort studies", "genetic risk score", "meta-analysis", "risk prediction"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cohort Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Chouraki", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fleur", "Last Name": "Maury", "Affiliation": "Lille University, Inserm, Lille University Hospital, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1167 - RID-AGE - Risk factors and molecular determinants of aging-related diseases;

However, owing to the complexity of LOAD, including pathological heterogeneity and disease polygenicity, extraction of actionable guidance from LOAD genetics has been challenging. Past attempts to summarize the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants have used pathway analysis and collections of small-scale experiments to hypothesize functional convergence across several variants. In this Review, we discuss how the study of molecular, cellular and brain networks provides additional information on the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants. We then discuss emerging combinations of these omic data sets into multiscale models, which provide a more comprehensive representation of the effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants at multiple biophysical scales.

Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes (|\u03c1^| \u2248 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants.

pathogens, eliciting prototypical \"interferon signature genes\" that encode antiviral and inflammatory mediators. For a global view of IFN signatures and regulatory pathways, we performed gene expression and chromatin analyses of the IFN-induced response across a range of immunocyte lineages. These distinguished ISGs by cell-type specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to tonic IFN and revealed underlying changes in chromatin configuration. We combined 1,398 human and mouse datasets to computationally infer ISG modules and their regulators, validated by genetic analysis in both species. Some ISGs are controlled by Stat1/2 and Irf9 and the ISRE DNA motif, but others appeared dependent on non-canonical factors. This regulatory framework helped to interpret JAK1 blockade pharmacology, different clusters being affected under tonic or IFN-stimulated conditions, and the IFN signatures previously associated with human diseases, revealing unrecognized subtleties in disease footprints, as affected by human ancestry.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Datasets as Topic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Interferon Type I", "Janus Kinases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Statistics and Department Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6H 3N1, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hideyuki", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Devapregasan", "Last Name": "Moodley", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hugo", "Last Name": "LeBoit\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Rothamel", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Towfique", "Last Name": "Raj", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chun Jimmie", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Chevrier", "Affiliation": "FAS Center for Systems Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shen-Ying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Laurent", "Last Name": "Casanova", "Affiliation": "St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Immunosciences, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Hegen", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Immunosciences, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Baptiste", "Last Name": "Telliez", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Immunosciences, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nir", "Last Name": "Hacohen", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aviv", "Last Name": "Regev", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Mathis", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Base Sequence", "Cell Lineage", "Cells, Cultured", "Chromatin", "Chromosomes, Human", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Datasets as Topic", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Genetic Variation", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Histones", "Humans", "Organ Specificity", "RNA", "Reference Values"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anshul", "Last Name": "Kundaje", "Affiliation": "1] Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 32 Vassar St, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromosome Mapping", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9", "Dementia", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases", "Odds Ratio", "Phenotype", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Quantitative Trait Loci"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "John P.

Here, we demonstrate that rare, low-frequency and common alleles at one gene locus, phospholipase B1 (PLB1), might contribute to risk of RA in a 4-generation consanguineous pedigree (Middle Eastern ancestry) and also in unrelated individuals from the general population (European ancestry). Through identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a non-synonymous c.2263G>C (p.G755R) mutation at the PLB1 gene on 2q23, which significantly co-segregated with RA in family members with a dominant mode of inheritance (P = 0.009). We further evaluated PLB1 variants and risk of RA using a GWAS meta-analysis of 8,875 RA cases and 29,367 controls of European ancestry. We identified significant contributions of two independent non-coding variants near PLB1 with risk of RA (rs116018341 [MAF = 0.042] and rs116541814 [MAF = 0.021], combined P = 3.2 \u00d7 10(-6)). Finally, we performed deep exon sequencing of PLB1 in 1,088 RA cases and 1,088 controls (European ancestry), and identified suggestive dispersion of rare protein-coding variant frequencies between cases and controls (P = 0.049 for C-alpha test and P = 0.055 for SKAT). Together, these data suggest that PLB1 is a candidate risk gene for RA. Future studies to characterize the full spectrum of genetic risk in the PLB1 genetic locus are warranted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Base Sequence", "Cohort Studies", "Consanguinity", "Exome", "Exons", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotyping Techniques", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Lysophospholipase", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Factors", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yukinori", "Last Name": "Okada", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America ;

We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Asian People", "Case-Control Studies", "Computational Biology", "Drug Discovery", "Drug Repositioning", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yukinori", "Last Name": "Okada", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.
