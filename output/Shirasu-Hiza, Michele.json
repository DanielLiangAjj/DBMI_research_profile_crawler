Because insulin resistance and diabetes are both associated with obesity, which also affects fertility, the role of insulin signaling itself in embryo development is not well understood. A key downstream target of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway is the forkhead family transcription factor FoxO (DAF-16 in C. elegans ). Here, we used quantitative live imaging to measure the patterning of endogenously tagged FoxO/DAF-16 in the early worm embryo. In 2-4-cell stage embryos, FoxO/DAF-16 initially localized uniformly to all cell nuclei, then became dramatically enriched in germ precursor cell nuclei beginning at the 8-cell stage. This nuclear enrichment in early germ precursor cells required germ fate specification, PI3K (AGE-1)- and PTEN (DAF-18)-mediated phospholipid regulation, and the deubiquitylase USP7 (MATH-33), yet was unexpectedly insulin receptor (DAF-2)- and AKT-independent. Functional analysis revealed that FoxO/DAF-16 acts as a cell cycle pacer for early cleavage divisions-without FoxO/DAF-16 cell cycles were shorter than in controls, especially in germ lineage cells. These results reveal the germ lineage specific patterning, upstream regulation, and cell cycle role for FoxO/DAF-16 during early C. elegans embryogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Mauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sophia L", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May14"}, {"PMID": "38696255", "Title": "Germ fate determinants protect germ precursor cell division by reducing septin and anillin levels at the cell division plane.", "Abstract": "Animal cell cytokinesis, or the physical division of one cell into two, is thought to be driven by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the division plane.

Because sleep defects and ASD are linked to metabolic dysregulation, we tested the starvation response of neuronal Cul3 knockdown flies; they starved faster and had lower triacylglyceride levels than controls, suggesting defects in metabolic homeostasis. ASD is also characterized by increased biomarkers of oxidative stress; we found that neuronal Cul3 knockdown increased sensitivity to hyperoxia, an exogenous oxidative stress.

Here, we investigated the genetic loss of a similar enzyme in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Because the enzyme Ebony modifies and inactivates amine neurotransmitters, its loss is assumed to increase neurotransmitter levels, increasing behaviors such as aggression and courtship and decreasing sleep. Indeed, ebony mutants have been described since 1960 as \"aggressive mutants,\" though this behavior has not been quantified. Using automated machine learning-based analyses, we quantitatively confirmed that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggressive behaviors such as boxing\u00a0but also decreased courtship behaviors and increased sleep. Through tissue-specific knockdown, we found that ebony's role in these behaviors was specific to glia. Unexpectedly, direct measurement of amine neurotransmitters in ebony brains revealed that their levels were not increased but reduced. Thus, increased aggression is the anomalous behavior for this neurotransmitter profile. We further found that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggression only when fighting each other, not when fighting wild-type controls. Moreover, fights between ebony mutants were less likely to end with a clear winner than fights between controls or fights between ebony mutants and controls. In ebony vs. control fights, ebony mutants were more likely to win.

TBI also shares molecular and cellular hallmarks with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), typically increasing in prevalence with age, and is a major risk factor for developing neurodegeneration later in life. While our understanding of genes and pathways that underlie neurotoxicity in specific NDs has advanced, we still lack a complete understanding of early molecular and physiological changes that drive neurodegeneration, particularly as an individual ages following a TBI. Recently Drosophila has been introduced as a model organism for studying closed-head TBI. In this paper, we deliver a TBI to flies early in adult life, and then measure molecular and physiological phenotypes at short-, mid-, and long-term timepoints following the injury. We aim to identify the timing of changes that contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we confirm prior work demonstrating a TBI-induced decline in lifespan, and present evidence of a progressive decline in locomotor function, robust acute and modest chronic neuroinflammation, and a late-onset increase in protein aggregation. We also present evidence of metabolic dysfunction, in the form of starvation sensitivity and decreased lipids, that persists beyond the immediate injury response, but does not differ long-term. An intervention of dietary restriction (DR) partially ameliorates some TBI-induced phenotypes, including lifespan and locomotor function, though it does not alter the pattern of starvation sensitivity of injured flies.

CLS-2 targeting is mediated by the CENP-F-like HCP-1/2, but their roles in cytokinesis and midbody assembly are not known. We found that although HCP-1 and HCP-2 mostly function cooperatively, HCP-1 plays a more primary role in promoting CLS-2-dependent central spindle microtubule assembly. HCP-1/2 codisrupted embryos did not form central spindles but completed cytokinesis and formed functional midbodies capable of supporting abscission. These central spindle-independent midbodies appeared to form via contractile ring constriction-driven bundling of astral microtubules at the furrow tip.

Sixteen of these neurons secrete the neuropeptide Pdf and have been called 'master pacemakers' because they are essential for circadian rhythms. A subset of Pdf+ neurons (the morning oscillator) regulates morning activity and communicates with other non-Pdf+ neurons, including a subset called the evening oscillator. It has been assumed that the molecular clock in Pdf+ neurons is required for these functions. To test this, we developed and validated Gal4-UAS based CRISPR tools for cell-specific disruption of key molecular clock components, period and timeless. While loss of the molecular clock in both the morning and evening oscillators eliminates circadian locomotor activity, the molecular clock in either oscillator alone is sufficient to rescue circadian locomotor activity in the absence of the other.

In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton.

Rho, activated by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor ECT-2, is upstream of both myosin-II activation and diaphanous formin-mediated filamentous actin (f-actin) assembly, which drive ring constriction. The role for Rac and its regulators is more controversial, but, based on the finding that Rac inactivation can rescue cytokinesis failure when the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4 is disrupted, Rac activity was proposed to be inhibitory to contractile ring constriction and thus specifically inactivated by CYK-4 at the division plane. An alternative model proposes that Rac inactivation generally rescues cytokinesis failure by reducing cortical tension, thus making it easier for the cell to divide when ring constriction is compromised. In this alternative model, CYK-4 was instead proposed to activate Rho by binding ECT-2. Using a combination of time-lapse in vivo single-cell analysis and Caenorhabditis elegans genetics, our evidence does not support this alternative model. First, we found that Rac disruption does not generally rescue cytokinesis failure: inhibition of Rac specifically rescues cytokinesis failure due to disruption of CYK-4 or ECT-2 but does not rescue cytokinesis failure due to disruption of two other contractile ring components, the Rho effectors diaphanous formin and myosin-II. Second, if CYK-4 regulates cytokinesis through Rho rather than Rac, then CYK-4 inhibition should decrease levels of downstream targets of Rho. Inconsistent with this, we found no change in the levels of f-actin or myosin-II at the division plane when CYK-4 GAP activity was reduced, suggesting that CYK-4 is not upstream of ECT-2/Rho activation. Instead, we found that the rescue of cytokinesis in CYK-4 mutants by Rac inactivation was Cdc42 dependent.

For example, many fields of biology are developing the use of NIR for optogenetics, in which an NIR laser induces a change in gene expression and/or protein function. One major technical barrier in working with both NIR and visible light on an optical microscope is obtaining their precise coalignment at the imaging plane position. Photon upconverting particles (UCPs) can bridge this gap as they are excited by NIR light but emit in the visible range via an anti-Stokes luminescence mechanism. Here, two different UCPs have been identified, high-efficiency micro540-UCPs and lower efficiency nano545-UCPs, that respond to NIR light and emit visible light with high photostability even at very high NIR power densities (>25\u202f000 Suns). Both of these UCPs can be rapidly and reversibly excited by visible and NIR light and emit light at visible wavelengths detectable with standard emission settings used for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a commonly used genetically encoded fluorophore. However, the high efficiency micro540-UCPs were suboptimal for NIR and visible light coalignment, due to their larger size and spatial broadening from particle-to-particle energy transfer consistent with a long-lived excited state and saturated power dependence. In contrast, the lower efficiency nano-UCPs were superior for precise coalignment of the NIR beam with the visible light path (\u223c2 \u03bcm versus \u223c8 \u03bcm beam broadening, respectively) consistent with limited particle-to-particle energy transfer, superlinear power dependence for emission, and much smaller particle size. Furthermore, the nano-UCPs were superior to a traditional two-camera method for NIR and visible light path alignment in an in vivo Infrared-Laser-Evoked Gene Operator (IR-LEGO) optogenetics assay in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Currently, it is unknown how circadian-regulated behavior impacts immunity against infection. Two broad categories of defense against bacterial infection are resistance, control of microbial growth, and tolerance, control of the pathogenic effects of infection. Our study of behaviorally arrhythmic Drosophila circadian period mutants identified a novel link between nutrient intake and tolerance of infection with\u00a0B.\u00a0cepacia, a bacterial pathogen of rising importance in hospital-acquired infections. We found that infection tolerance in wild-type animals is stimulated by acute exposure to dietary glucose and amino acids. Glucose-stimulated tolerance was induced by feeding or direct injection; injections revealed a\u00a0narrow window for glucose-stimulated tolerance. In\u00a0contrast, amino acids stimulated tolerance only when ingested. We investigated the role of a known amino-acid-sensing pathway, the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway, in immunity. TORC1 is circadian regulated and inhibition of TORC1 decreased resistance, as in vertebrates. Surprisingly, inhibition\u00a0of the less well-characterized TOR complex 2 (TORC2) dramatically increased survival, through both resistance and tolerance mechanisms. This work suggests that dietary intake on the day of infection by B.\u00a0cepacia can make a significant difference in long-term survival. We further demonstrate that TOR signaling mediates both resistance and tolerance of infection and identify TORC2 as a novel potential therapeutic target for increasing survival of infection.", "Keywords": ["Burkholderia cepacia", "Drosophila", "Rictor", "TOR", "TORC1", "TORC2", "amino acids", "circadian", "diet", "feeding", "glucose", "immunity", "infection", "period mutant", "resistance", "tolerance"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Feeding Behavior", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Period Circadian Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Signal Transduction", "Sirolimus", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Victoria W", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reed M", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Ulgherait", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarice G", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth F", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa M", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith R", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolism and Aging, Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "William W", "Last Name": "Ja", "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolism and Aging, Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mimi M", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

During asymmetric cell divisions, the core polarity machinery (partitioning defective [PAR] proteins) controls the unequal inheritance of key cell fate determinants. Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the cortical PAR proteins (including the small guanosine triphosphatase CDC-42) have an active role in regulating recruitment of a critical component of the contractile ring, filamentous actin (F-actin). We found that the cortical PAR proteins are required for the retention of anillin and septin in the anterior pole, which are cytokinesis proteins that our genetic data suggest act as inhibitors of F-actin at the contractile ring.

This paradigm is useful to understand the effect of presence vs. absence of a specific gene product but cannot account for concentration-dependent effects, such as may occur with some bacterial toxins. In order to assess threshold and dose-response effects of virulence factors, robust systems for tunable expression are required. Recent evidence suggests that the folding free energy (\u0394G) of the 5' end of mRNA transcripts can have a significant effect on translation efficiency and overall protein abundance. Here we demonstrate that rational alteration of 5' mRNA folding free energy by introduction of synonymous mutations allows for predictable changes in pneumolysin (PLY) expression by Streptococcus pneumoniae without the need for chemical inducers or heterologous promoters. We created a panel of isogenic S. pneumoniae strains, differing only in synonymous (silent) mutations at the 5' end of the PLY mRNA that are predicted to alter \u0394G. Such manipulation allows rheostat-like control of PLY production and alters the cytotoxicity of whole S. pneumoniae on primary and immortalized human cells.
