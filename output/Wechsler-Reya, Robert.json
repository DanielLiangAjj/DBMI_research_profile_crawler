To address this challenge, we leveraged established network-based methodologies to elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic, non-oncogene dependencies of seven coexisting subpopulations identified by single-cell analysis-whose enrichment in essential genes was validated by pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Perturbational profiles of 372 clinically relevant drugs helped identify those able to invert the activity of subpopulation-specific MRs for follow-up in vivo validation.

After identifying the PI3K/mTOR pathway as a therapeutic vulnerability, they treated DIPG-bearing mice with paxalisib and saw responses but also observed hyperglycemia as a severe side effect. Combining paxalisib with metformin mitigated this toxicity, but also upregulated protein kinase C (PKC) signaling.

Reduction in TH levels frees the TH receptor, TR\u03b11, to bind to EZH2 and repress expression of NeuroD1, a transcription factor that drives tumor cell differentiation. Increased TH reverses EZH2-mediated repression of NeuroD1 by abrogating the binding of EZH2 and TR\u03b11, thereby stimulating tumor cell differentiation and reducing MB growth.

was previously identified as an important regulator of cells that descend from neural cells. Since medulloblastomas primarily affect cells with similar ontogeny, we investigated the role and mechanism of miR-211 in MB. Here we showed that\u00a0miR-211 expression was highly downregulated in cell lines, PDXs, and clinical samples of different MB subgroups (SHH, Group 3, and Group 4) compared to normal cerebellum. miR-211 gene was ectopically expressed in transgenic cells from MB subgroups, and they were subjected to molecular and phenotypic investigations. Monoclonal cells stably expressing miR-211 were injected into the mouse cerebellum. miR-211 forced expression acts as a tumor suppressor in MB both in vitro and in vivo, attenuating growth, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting invasion. In support of emerging regulatory roles of metabolism in various forms of cancer, we identified the acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member (ACSL4) as a direct miR-211 target. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticle-coated, dendrimer-coated, and cerium oxide-coated miR-211 nanoparticles were applied to deliver synthetic miR-211 into MB cell lines and cellular responses were assayed. Synthesizing nanoparticle-miR-211 conjugates can suppress MB cell viability and invasion in vitro. Our findings reveal miR-211 as a tumor suppressor and a potential therapeutic agent in MB.

Applying computational methods for the detection and reconstruction of ecDNA across a retrospective cohort of 481 medulloblastoma tumors from 465 patients, we identify circular ecDNA in 82 patients (18%). Patients with ecDNA-positive medulloblastoma were more than twice as likely to relapse and three times as likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis. A subset of tumors harbored multiple ecDNA lineages, each containing distinct amplified oncogenes. Multimodal sequencing, imaging and CRISPR inhibition experiments in medulloblastoma models reveal intratumoral heterogeneity of ecDNA copy number per cell and frequent putative 'enhancer rewiring' events on ecDNA. This study reveals the frequency and diversity of ecDNA in medulloblastoma, stratified into molecular subgroups, and suggests copy number heterogeneity and enhancer rewiring as oncogenic features of

With this in mind, a major challenge in developing therapies for central nervous system (CNS) tumors is to overcome barriers to delivery, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Panobinostat is a nonselective pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being tested in preclinical and clinical studies, including for the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma, which has a propensity for leptomeningeal spread and diffuse midline glioma, which can infiltrate into supratentorial brain regions. In this study, we examined the rate, extent, and spatial heterogeneity of panobinostat CNS distribution in mice. Transporter-deficient mouse studies show that panobinostat is a dual substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (Bcrp), which are major efflux transporters expressed at the BBB. The CNS delivery of panobinostat was moderately limited by P-gp and Bcrp, and the unbound tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient of panobinostat was 0.32 and 0.21 in the brain and spinal cord in wild-type mice. In addition, following intravenous administration, panobinostat demonstrated heterogeneous distribution among brain regions, indicating that its efficacy would be influenced by tumor location or the presence and extent of leptomeningeal spread. Simulation using a compartmental BBB model suggests inadequate exposure of free panobinostat in the brain following a recommended oral dosing regimen in patients. Therefore, alternative approaches to CNS delivery may be necessary to have adequate exposure of free panobinostat for the treatment of a broad range of pediatric brain tumors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study shows that the central nervous system (CNS) penetration of panobinostat is limited by P-gp and Bcrp, and its efficacy may be limited by inadequate distribution to the tumor. Panobinostat has heterogeneous distribution into various brain regions, indicating that its efficacy might depend on the anatomical location of the tumors. These distributional parameters in the mouse CNS can inform both preclinical and clinical trial study design and may guide treatment for these devastating brain tumors in children.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Panobinostat", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Central Nervous System", "Brain", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain Neoplasms", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1", "Membrane Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenqiu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Brain Barriers Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota (Wenq.Z, J.-H.O., Wenj.Z., S.R., W.F.E.);

To determine whether stem/progenitor cells can serve as cells of origin, we created a Msi2-CreERT2 knock-in mouse. When crossed to CAG-LSL-MycT58A mice, Msi2-CreERT2 mice developed multiple pancreatic cancer subtypes: ductal, acinar, adenosquamous, and rare anaplastic tumors. Combining single-cell genomics with computational analysis of developmental states and lineage trajectories, we demonstrate that MYC preferentially triggers transformation of the most immature MSI2+ pancreas cells into multi-lineage pre-cancer cells. These pre-cancer cells subsequently diverge to establish pancreatic cancer subtypes by activating distinct transcriptional programs and large-scale genomic changes, and enforced expression of specific signals like Ras can redirect subtype specification. This study shows that multiple pancreatic cancer subtypes can arise from a common pool of MSI2+ cells and provides a powerful model to understand and control the programs that shape divergent fates in pancreatic cancer.", "Keywords": ["Musashi", "Myc", "acinar cell carcinoma", "adenosquamous carcinoma", "cancer", "cell of origin stem cells", "pancreatic cancer", "single cell", "tumor evolution"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nirakar", "Last Name": "Rajbhandari", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA;

The two most common and aggressive molecular groups of ependymoma are the supratentorial ZFTA-fusion associated and the posterior fossa ependymoma group A. In both groups, tumors occur mainly in young children and frequently recur after treatment. Although molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases have recently been uncovered, they remain difficult to target and innovative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we use genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), complemented with CTCF and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in primary and relapsed ependymoma tumors, to identify chromosomal conformations and regulatory mechanisms associated with aberrant gene expression. In particular, we observe the formation of new topologically associating domains ('neo-TADs') caused by structural variants, group-specific 3D chromatin loops, and the replacement of CTCF insulators by DNA hyper-methylation. Through inhibition experiments, we validate that genes implicated by these 3D genome conformations are essential for the survival of patient-derived ependymoma models in a group-specific manner.

CircRNAs are increasingly recognized as stable non-coding RNA therapeutic targets in many cancers, but little is known about their function in MBs. To determine medulloblastoma subgroup-specific circRNAs, publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 175 MB patients were interrogated to identify circRNAs that differentiate between MB subgroups. circ_63706 was identified as sonic hedgehog (SHH) group-specific, with its expression confirmed by RNA-FISH analysis in clinical tissue samples. The oncogenic function of circ_63706 was characterized in vitro and in vivo. Further, circ_63706-depleted cells were subjected to RNA-seq and lipid profiling to identify its molecular function. Finally, we mapped the circ_63706 secondary structure using an advanced random forest classification model and modeled a 3D structure to identify its interacting miRNA partner molecules. Circ_63706 regulates independently of the host coding gene pericentrin (PCNT), and its expression is specific to the SHH subgroup. circ_63706-deleted cells implanted into mice produced smaller tumors, and mice lived longer than parental cell implants. At the molecular level, circ_63706-deleted cells elevated total ceramide and oxidized lipids and reduced total triglyceride.

"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor of childhood, comprising a heterogenous group of tumors each with distinct biology, clinical behavior, and prognosis. Long-term survival remains unacceptable, and those who do survive face high late mortality risk, new chronic treatment-related medical conditions, neurocognitive impairments, and poor health-related quality of life. Up-front treatment strategies now integrate molecular subgrouping with standard clinico-radiological factors to more actually risk stratify newly-diagnosed patients. To what extent this new stratification will lead to improvements in treatment outcome will be determined in the coming years. In parallel, discovery and appreciation for medulloblastoma's inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity continues growing. Clinical trials treating relapsed disease now encompass precision medicine, epigenetic modification, and immune therapy approaches. The Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (PNOC) Medulloblastoma Working Group is committed to developing clinical trials based on these evolving therapeutic strategies and supports translational efforts by PNOC researchers and the multi-stakeholder medulloblastoma community at large.", "Keywords": ["Clinical trials", "Epigenetics", "Immunotherapy", "Medulloblastoma", "Precision medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Medulloblastoma", "Cerebellar Neoplasms", "Quality of Life", "Prognosis", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tab", "Last Name": "Cooney", "Affiliation": "Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

MYC amplification is an independent poor prognostic factor in G3 MB, however, therapeutic targeting of the MYC pathway remains limited and alternative therapies for G3 MB are urgently needed. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein, Musashi-1 (MSI1) is an essential mediator of G3 MB in both MYC-overexpressing mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. MSI1 inhibition abrogates tumor initiation and significantly prolongs survival in both models. We identify binding targets of MSI1 in normal neural and G3 MB stem cells and then cross referenced these data with unbiased large-scale screens at the transcriptomic, translatomic and proteomic levels to systematically dissect its functional role. Comparative integrative multi-omic analyses of these large datasets reveal cancer-selective MSI1-bound targets sharing multiple MYC associated pathways, providing a valuable resource for context-specific therapeutic targeting of G3 MB.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Humans", "Proteomics", "Medulloblastoma", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cerebellar

Cancer cells are constantly exposed to proteotoxic stress associated with alterations in protein production or folding. It remains poorly understood how cancers cope with proteotoxic stress to promote their growth. Here, our data revealed that N-myc regulates the expression of specific components (\u223c5%) of the protein folding machinery at the translational level through the major cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E. Reducing eIF4E levels in mouse models of medulloblastoma blocked tumorigenesis. Importantly, targeting Hsp70, a protein folding chaperone translationally regulated by N-myc, suppressed tumor growth in mouse and human medulloblastoma xenograft models.

Here, we observed that SOX9, a transcription factor and stem cell/glial fate marker, is limited to rare, quiescent cells in high-risk medulloblastoma with MYC amplification. In paired primary-recurrent patient samples, SOX9-positive cells accumulated in medulloblastoma relapses. SOX9 expression anti-correlated with MYC expression in murine and human medulloblastoma cells. However, SOX9-positive cells were plastic and could give rise to a MYC high state. To follow relapse at the single-cell level, an inducible dual Tet model of medulloblastoma was developed, in which MYC expression was redirected in vivo from treatment-sensitive bulk cells to dormant SOX9-positive cells using doxycycline treatment. SOX9 was essential for relapse initiation and depended on suppression of MYC activity to promote therapy resistance, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immune escape. p53 and DNA repair pathways were downregulated in recurrent tumors, whereas MGMT was upregulated. Recurrent tumor cells were found to be sensitive to treatment with an MGMT inhibitor and doxorubicin.

CBFA2T2 is expressed early in the progenitor cells of the cerebellar RL subventricular zone in Homo sapiens, and G4 MB transcriptionally resembles these progenitors but are stalled in developmental time. Knockdown of OTX2 in model systems relieves this differentiation blockade, which allows MB cells to spontaneously proceed along normal developmental differentiation trajectories.

progression in patients with glioblastoma remains a major challenge. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potential biomarkers and can be detected in the blood of patients with glioblastoma. In our study, we evaluated the potential of serum-derived EVs from glioblastoma patients to serve as biomarker for tumor progression. EVs from serum of glioblastoma patients and healthy volunteers were separated by size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation. EV markers were defined by using a proximity-extension assay and bead-based flow cytometry. Tumor progression was defined according to modified RANO criteria. EVs from the serum of glioblastoma patients (n\u00a0=\u00a067) showed an upregulation of CD29, CD44, CD81, CD146, C1QA and histone H3 as compared to serum EVs from healthy volunteers (P value range: <.0001 to .08). For two independent cohorts of glioblastoma patients, we noted upregulation of C1QA, CD44 and histone H3 upon tumor progression, but not in patients with stable disease. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, a combination of CD29, CD44, CD81, C1QA and histone H3 correlated with RANO-defined tumor progression with an AUC of 0.76. Measurement of CD29, CD44, CD81, C1QA and histone H3 in serum-derived EVs of glioblastoma patients, along with standard MRI assessment, has the potential to improve detection of true tumor progression and thus could be a useful biomarker for clinical decision making.", "Keywords": ["biomarkers", "extracellular vesicles", "glioblastoma", "protein-signature", "tumor-progression"], "MeSH terms":

MB is classified into four primary molecular subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3 (G3), and Group 4 (G4), and further genomic and proteomic subtypes have been reported. Subgroup heterogeneity and few actionable mutations have hindered the development of targeted therapies, especially for G3 MB, which has a particularly poor prognosis. To identify novel therapeutic targets for MB, we performed mass spectrometry-based deep expression proteomics and phosphoproteomics in 20 orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of MB comprising SHH, G3, and G4 subgroups. We found that the proteomic profiles of MB PDX tumors are closely aligned with those of primary human MB tumors illustrating the utility of PDX models. SHH PDXs were enriched for NF\u03baB and p38 MAPK signaling, while G3 PDXs were characterized by MYC activity. Additionally, we found a significant association between actinomycin D sensitivity and increased abundance of MYC and MYC target genes. Our results highlight several candidate pathways that may serve as targets for new MB therapies.

Although immunotherapy has shown promise in many cancers, the low mutational burden, limited infiltration of immune effector cells, and immune-suppressive microenvironment of medulloblastoma have led to the assumption that it is unlikely to respond to immunotherapy. However, emerging evidence is challenging this view. Here we review recent preclinical and clinical studies that have identified mechanisms of immune evasion in medulloblastoma, and highlight possible therapeutic interventions that may give new hope to medulloblastoma patients and their families.", "Keywords": ["CAR T cell", "antigen presentation", "immune checkpoint", "immunotherapy", "medulloblastoma", "myeloid cell", "oncolytic virus", "pediatric brain tumor", "vaccination"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Cerebellar Neoplasms", "Child", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Medulloblastoma", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tanja", "Last Name": "Eisemann", "Affiliation": "Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2022May01"}, {"PMID": "35322202", "Title": "Disruption of GMNC-MCIDAS multiciliogenesis program is critical in choroid plexus carcinoma development.", "Abstract": "Multiciliated cells (MCCs) in the brain reside in the ependyma and the choroid plexus (CP) epithelia. The CP secretes cerebrospinal fluid that circulates within the ventricular system, driven by ependymal cilia movement. Tumors of the CP are rare primary brain neoplasms mostly found in children. CP tumors exist in three forms: CP papilloma (CPP), atypical CPP, and CP carcinoma (CPC). Though CPP and atypical CPP are generally benign and can be resolved by surgery, CPC is a particularly aggressive and little understood cancer with a poor survival rate and a tendency for recurrence and metastasis. In contrast to MCCs in the CP epithelia, CPCs in humans are characterized by solitary cilia, frequent TP53 mutations, and disturbances to multiciliogenesis program directed by the GMNC-MCIDAS transcriptional network. GMNC and MCIDAS are early transcriptional regulators of MCC fate differentiation in diverse tissues. Consistently, components of the GMNC-MCIDAS transcriptional program are expressed during CP development and required for multiciliation in the CP, while CPC driven by deletion of Trp53 and Rb1 in mice exhibits multiciliation defects consequent to deficiencies in the GMNC-MCIDAS program. Previous studies revealed that abnormal NOTCH pathway activation leads to CPP. Here we show that combined defects in NOTCH and Sonic Hedgehog signaling in mice generates tumors that are similar to CPC in humans. NOTCH-driven CP tumors are monociliated, and disruption of the NOTCH complex restores multiciliation and decreases tumor growth. NOTCH suppresses multiciliation in tumor cells by inhibiting the expression of GMNC and MCIDAS, while Gmnc-Mcidas overexpression rescues multiciliation defects and suppresses tumor cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings indicate that reactivation of the GMNC-MCIDAS multiciliogenesis program is critical for inhibiting tumorigenesis in the CP, and it may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of CPC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinoma", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Choroid Plexus Neoplasms", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Mice", "Nuclear Proteins"], "Authors":

Mainstay treatments of radiation and chemotherapy have not changed in decades and new treatment approaches are crucial for the improvement of clinical outcomes. To date, immunotherapies for medulloblastoma have been unsuccessful, and studies investigating the immune microenvironment of the disease and the impact of current therapies are limited. Preclinical models that recapitulate both the disease and immune environment are essential for understanding immune-tumor interactions and to aid the identification of new and effective immunotherapies. Using an immune-competent mouse model of aggressive Myc-driven medulloblastoma, we characterized the brain immune microenvironment and changes induced in response to craniospinal irradiation, or the medulloblastoma chemotherapies cyclophosphamide or gemcitabine. The role of adaptive immunity in disease progression and treatment response was delineated by comparing survival outcomes in wildtype C57Bl/6J and in mice deficient in Rag1 that lack mature T and B cells. We found medulloblastomas in wildtype and Rag1-deficient mice grew equally fast, and that craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapies extended survival equally in wildtype and Rag1-deficient mice, suggesting that tumor growth and treatment response is independent of T and B cells. Medulloblastomas were myeloid dominant, and in wildtype mice, craniospinal irradiation and cyclophosphamide depleted T and B cells in the brain. Gemcitabine treatment was found to minimally alter the immune populations in the brain, resulting only in a depletion of neutrophils. Intratumorally, we observed an abundance of Iba1+ macrophages, and we show that CD45high cells comprise the majority of immune cells within these medulloblastomas but found that existing markers are insufficient to clearly delineate resident microglia from infiltrating macrophages. Ultimately, brain resident and peripheral macrophages dominate the brain and tumor microenvironment and are not depleted by standard-of-care medulloblastoma therapies. These populations therefore present a favorable target for immunotherapy in combination with front-line treatments.", "Keywords": ["chemotherapy", "craniospinal irradiation", "group 3", "immune microenvironment", "immunocharacterization", "medulloblastoma", "microglia"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Cerebellar Neoplasms", "Cyclophosphamide", "Disease Models, Animal", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Immunotherapy", "Medulloblastoma", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myeloid Cells", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zahra", "Last Name": "Abbas", "Affiliation": "Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "George", "Affiliation": "Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mathew", "Last Name": "Ancliffe", "Affiliation": "Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Meegan", "Last Name": "Howlett", "Affiliation": "Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Anya C", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mani", "Last Name": "Kuchibhotla", "Affiliation": "Brain Tumour Research Program, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "NCI-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas G", "Last Name": "Gottardo", "Affiliation": "Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Raelene", "Last Name": "Endersby", "Affiliation": "Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35121998", "Title": "The current landscape of immunotherapy for pediatric brain tumors.", "Abstract": "Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the most common solid malignancies in childhood, and aggressive therapy often leads to long-term sequelae in survivors, making these tumors challenging to treat.

Traditional anticancer drug discovery based on in vitro cultures tends to identify targets with poor therapeutic indices and fails to accurately model the effects of the tumor microenvironment. Here, leveraging in vivo genetic screening, we identified the histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) regulator DPY30 (Dpy-30 histone methyltransferase complex regulatory subunit) as an in vivo\u2013specific glioblastoma dependency. On the basis of the hypothesis that in vivo epigenetic regulation may define critical GSC dependencies, we interrogated active chromatin landscapes of GSCs derived from intracranial patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and cell culture through H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptome analyses. Intracranial-specific genes marked by H3K4me3 included FOS, NF\u03baB, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) family members. In intracranial PDX tumors, DPY30 regulated angiogenesis and hypoxia pathways in an H3K4me3-dependent manner but was dispensable in vitro in cultured GSCs. PDE4B was a key downstream effector of DPY30, and the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram preferentially targeted DPY30-expressing cells and impaired PDX tumor growth in mice without affecting tumor cells cultured in vitro. Collectively, the MLL/SET1 (mixed lineage leukemia/SET domain-containing 1, histone lysine methyltransferase) complex member DPY30 selectively regulates H3K4me3 modification on genes critical to support angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting the DPY30-PDE4B axis as a specific therapeutic target in glioblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chromatin", "Cyclic

Here, we enable genetic screens in physiologically relevant ex vivo cancer tissue models by integrating CRISPR-Cas-based genome engineering and biofabrication technologies. We first present a novel method for generating perfusable tissue constructs, and validate its functionality by using it to generate three-dimensional perfusable dense cultures of cancer cell lines and sustain otherwise ex vivo unculturable patient-derived xenografts. Using this system we enable large-scale CRISPR screens in perfused tissue cultures, as well as emulate a novel point-of-care diagnostics scenario of a clinically actionable CRISPR knockout (CRISPRko) screen of genes with FDA-approved drug treatments in ex vivo PDX cell cultures.

However, IM does not cure GIST, and adjuvant therapy only delays recurrence in high-risk tumors. We hypothesized that GIST contains cells with primary IM resistance that may represent a reservoir for disease persistence. Here, we report a subpopulation of CD34+KITlow human GIST cells that have intrinsic IM resistance. These cells possess cancer stem cell-like expression profiles and behavior, including self-renewal and differentiation into CD34+KIThigh progeny that are sensitive to IM treatment. We also found that TKI treatment of GIST cell lines led to induction of stem cell-associated transcription factors (OCT4 and NANOG) and concomitant enrichment of the CD34+KITlow cell population. Using a data-driven approach, we constructed a transcriptomic-oncogenic map (Onco-GPS) based on the gene expression of 134 GIST samples to define pathway activation during GIST tumorigenesis. Tumors with low KIT expression had overexpression of cancer stem cell gene signatures consistent with our in vitro findings. Additionally, these tumors had activation of the Gas6/AXL pathway and NF-\u03baB signaling gene signatures. We evaluated these targets in vitro and found that primary IM-resistant GIST cells were effectively targeted with either single-agent bemcentinib (AXL inhibitor) or bardoxolone (NF-\u03baB inhibitor), as well as with either agent in combination with IM. Collectively, these findings suggest that CD34+KITlow cells represent a distinct, but targetable, subpopulation in human GIST that may represent a novel mechanism of primary TKI resistance, as well as a target for overcoming disease persistence following TKI therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Imatinib Mesylate", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sudeep", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Hyunho", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Ting", "Affiliation": "Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Chih-Min", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Mayra", "Last Name": "Yebra", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Alexander T", "Last Name": "Wenzel", "Affiliation": "Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Huwate", "Last Name": "Yeerna", "Affiliation": "Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Jill P", "Last Name": "Mesirov", "Affiliation": "Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California."}, {"First Name": "Pablo", "Last Name": "Tamayo", "Affiliation": "Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Jason K", "Last Name": "Sicklick", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, University of California, San Diego, California. jsicklick@health.ucsd.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "PubDate": "2021Oct"}, {"PMID": "34077540", "Title": "Neoplastic and immune single-cell transcriptomics define subgroup-specific intra-tumoral heterogeneity of childhood medulloblastoma.", "Abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to disease progression.

Treatment consists of surgery, followed by radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Despite this intensive approach, outcome remains dismal for patients with certain subtypes of MB, namely, MYC-amplified Group 3 and TP53-mutated SHH. Using high-throughput assays, six human MB cell lines were screened against a library of 3208 unique compounds. We identified 45 effective compounds from the screen and found that cell cycle checkpoint kinase (CHK1/2) inhibition synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic activity of clinically used chemotherapeutics cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. To identify the best-in-class inhibitor, multiple CHK1/2 inhibitors were assessed in mice bearing intracranial MB. When combined with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, CHK1/2 inhibition reduced tumor burden and increased survival of animals with high-risk MB, across multiple different models. In total, we tested 14 different models, representing distinct MB subgroups, and data were validated in three independent laboratories. Pharmacodynamics studies confirmed central nervous system penetration. In mice, combination treatment significantly increased DNA damage and apoptosis compared to chemotherapy alone, and studies with cultured cells showed that CHK inhibition disrupted chemotherapy-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings indicated CHK1/2 inhibition, specifically with LY2606368 (prexasertib), has strong chemosensitizing activity in MB that warrants further clinical investigation.

Medicine Identifies New Therapeutic Candidates for Medulloblastoma.", "Abstract": "Medulloblastoma is among the most common malignant brain tumors in children. Recent studies have identified at least four subgroups of the disease that differ in terms of molecular characteristics and patient outcomes. Despite this heterogeneity, most patients with medulloblastoma receive similar therapies, including surgery, radiation, and intensive chemotherapy. Although these treatments prolong survival, many patients still die from the disease and survivors suffer severe long-term side effects from therapy. We hypothesize that each patient with medulloblastoma is sensitive to different therapies and that tailoring therapy based on the molecular and cellular characteristics of patients' tumors will improve outcomes. To test this, we assembled a panel of orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and subjected them to DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, and high-throughput drug screening. Analysis of DNA sequencing revealed that most medulloblastomas do not have actionable mutations that point to effective therapies. In contrast, gene expression and drug response data provided valuable information about potential therapies for every tumor. For example, drug screening demonstrated that actinomycin D, which is used for treatment of sarcoma but rarely for medulloblastoma, was active against PDXs representing Group 3 medulloblastoma, the most aggressive form of the disease. Functional analysis of tumor cells was successfully used in a clinical setting to identify more treatment options than sequencing alone. These studies suggest that it should be possible to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and begin to treat each patient with therapies that are effective against their specific tumor. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that high-throughput drug screening identifies therapies for medulloblastoma that cannot be predicted by genomic or transcriptomic analysis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Differentiated MB cells highly express NeuroD1, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and forced expression of NeuroD1 promotes the differentiation of MB cells. The expression of NeuroD1 in bulk MB cells is repressed by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3).

microcephaly by killing neural precursor cells (NPCs) and other brain cells. ZIKV also displays therapeutic oncolytic activity against glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs). Here we demonstrate that ZIKV preferentially infected and killed GSCs and stem-like cells in medulloblastoma and ependymoma in a SOX2-dependent manner. Targeting SOX2 severely attenuated ZIKV infection, in contrast to AXL. As mechanisms of SOX2-mediated ZIKV infection, we identified inverse expression of antiviral interferon response genes (ISGs) and positive correlation with integrin \u03b1v (ITGAV). ZIKV infection was disrupted by genetic targeting of ITGAV or its binding partner ITGB5 and by an antibody specific for integrin \u03b1v\u03b25. ZIKV selectively eliminated GSCs from species-matched human mature cerebral organoids and GBM surgical specimens, which was reversed by integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 inhibition.

Here we generate humanized models for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup MB via MYCN overexpression in primary human hindbrain-derived neuroepithelial stem (hbNES) cells or iPSC-derived NES cells, which display a range of aggressive phenotypes upon xenografting. iPSC-derived NES tumors develop quickly with leptomeningeal dissemination, whereas hbNES-derived cells exhibit delayed tumor formation with less dissemination. Methylation and expression profiling show that tumors from both origins recapitulate hallmarks of infant SHH MB and reveal that mTOR activation, as a result of increased Oct4, promotes aggressiveness of human SHH tumors. Targeting mTOR decreases cell viability and prolongs survival, showing the utility of these varied models for dissecting mechanisms mediating tumor aggression and demonstrating the value of humanized models for a better understanding of pediatric cancers.", "Keywords": ["MYCN", "POU5F1", "mTOR", "medulloblastoma", "metastasis", "neuroepithelial stem cells", "reprogramming"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Immunohistochemistry", "Medulloblastoma", "Mice", "Octamer Transcription Factor-3", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cells", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matko", "Last Name": "\u010can\u010der", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Hutter", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Karl O", "Last Name": "Holmberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela", "Last Name": "Ros\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Anders", "Last Name": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Jignesh", "Last Name": "Tailor", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust-MRC Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Garancher", "Affiliation": "Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, NCI-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, 92037 La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magnus", "Last Name": "Essand", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, NCI-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, 92037 La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Holger", "Last Name": "Weishaupt", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Fredrik J", "Last Name": "Swartling", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

Here we report highly recurrent hotspot mutations (r.3A>G) of U1 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in about 50% of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas. These mutations were not present across other subgroups of medulloblastoma, and we identified these hotspot mutations in U1 snRNA in only <0.1% of 2,442 cancers, across 36 other tumour types. The mutations occur in 97% of adults (subtype SHH\u03b4) and 25% of adolescents (subtype SHH\u03b1) with SHH medulloblastoma, but are largely absent from SHH medulloblastoma in infants. The U1 snRNA mutations occur in the 5' splice-site binding region, and snRNA-mutant tumours have significantly disrupted RNA splicing and an excess of 5' cryptic splicing events. Alternative splicing mediated by mutant U1 snRNA inactivates tumour-suppressor genes (PTCH1) and activates oncogenes (GLI2 and CCND2), and represents a target for therapy.

its novel biological properties. In particular, ITZ inhibits the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and has the potential to serve as an anticancer chemotherapeutic against several Hh-dependent malignancies. We have extended our studies on ITZ analogues as Hh pathway inhibitors through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel des-triazole ITZ analogues that incorporate modifications to the triazolone/side chain region of the scaffold. Our overall results suggest that the triazolone/side chain region can be replaced with various functionalities (hydrazine carboxamides and meta-substituted amides) resulting in improved potency when compared to ITZ. Our studies also indicate that the stereochemical orientation of the dioxolane ring is important for both potent Hh pathway inhibition and compound stability.

Here we developed transgenic models of CPCs by activating the Myc oncogene and deleting the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene in murine neural stem cells or progenitors. Murine CPC resembled their human counterparts at a histologic level, and like the hypodiploid subset of human CPC, exhibited multiple whole-chromosome losses, particularly of chromosomes 8, 12, and 19. Analysis of murine and human CPC gene expression profiles and copy number changes revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage response, and cilium function. High-throughput drug screening identified small molecule inhibitors that decreased the viability of CPC.

identifying patients who will benefit from them remains a major clinical challenge. Here we show that medulloblastomas driven by the transcription factor Gfi1 are exquisitely dependent on the enzyme lysine demethylase 1 (Kdm1a/Lsd1). We demonstrate that Lsd1 physically associates with Gfi1, and that these proteins cooperate to inhibit genes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation. We also show that Lsd1 is essential for Gfi1-mediated transformation: Gfi1 proteins that cannot recruit Lsd1 are unable to drive tumorigenesis, and genetic ablation of Lsd1 markedly impairs tumor growth in vivo. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of Lsd1 potently inhibit growth of Gfi1-driven tumors.

limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.",

Medulloblastoma metastases are found almost exclusively on the leptomeningeal surface of the brain and spinal cord; dissemination is therefore thought to occur through shedding of primary tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid followed by distal re-implantation on the leptomeninges. We present evidence for medulloblastoma circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in therapy-naive patients and demonstrate in\u00a0vivo, through flank xenografting and parabiosis, that medulloblastoma CTCs can spread through the blood to the leptomeningeal space to form leptomeningeal metastases. Medulloblastoma leptomeningeal metastases express high levels of the chemokine CCL2, and expression of CCL2 in medulloblastoma in\u00a0vivo is sufficient to drive leptomeningeal dissemination.

To understand the role of m6A in development, we deleted Mettl14 in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model. Phenotypically, NSCs lacking Mettl14 displayed markedly decreased proliferation and premature differentiation, suggesting that m6A modification enhances NSC self-renewal. Decreases in the NSC pool led to a decreased number of late-born neurons during cortical neurogenesis. Mechanistically, we discovered a genome-wide increase in specific histone modifications in Mettl14 knockout versus control NSCs. These changes correlated with altered gene expression and observed cellular phenotypes, suggesting functional significance\u00a0of altered histone modifications in knockout cells. Finally, we found that m6A regulates histone modification in part by destabilizing transcripts that encode histone-modifying enzymes.

We show that QD labeling does not affect major biophysical properties of nanoparticles or their interaction with cells and tissues. Live cell imaging enabled simultaneous visualization of the interaction of control and targeted nanoparticles with bEnd.3 cells in a flow chamber, providing direct evidence that surface modification of nanoparticles with the cell-penetrating peptide TAT increases their biophysical association with cell surfaces over very short time periods under convective current. We next developed this technique for quantitative biodistribution analysis in vivo. These studies demonstrate that nanoparticle surface modification with the cell penetrating peptide TAT facilitates brain-specific delivery that is restricted to brain vasculature. Although nanoparticle entry into the healthy brain parenchyma is minimal, with no evidence for movement of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we observed that nanoparticles are able to enter to the central nervous system (CNS) through regions of altered BBB permeability - for example, into circumventricular organs in the brain or leaky vasculature of late-stage intracranial tumors.

In cancer, however, genes can be amplified in chromosomes or in circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), although the frequency and functional importance of ecDNA are not understood. We performed whole-genome sequencing, structural modelling and cytogenetic analyses of 17 different cancer types, including analysis of the structure and function of chromosomes during metaphase of 2,572 dividing cells, and developed a software package called ECdetect to conduct unbiased, integrated ecDNA detection and analysis. Here we show that ecDNA was found in nearly half of human cancers; its frequency varied by tumour type, but it was almost never found in normal cells. Driver oncogenes were amplified most commonly in ecDNA, thereby increasing transcript level.

Whole-transcriptome and functional analyses showed that tumour cell proliferation is associated with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the tumour microenvironment. Unlike CP epithelial cells, which have multiple primary cilia, tumour cells possess a solitary primary cilium as a result of Notch-mediated suppression of multiciliate differentiation. A Shh-driven signalling cascade in the primary cilium occurs in tumour cells but not in epithelial cells.

With the recent advances in our understanding of the genomic landscape of pediatric cancer, there is now enthusiasm for individualized cancer therapy based on genomic profiling of patients' tumors. However, several obstacles to effective personalized cancer therapy remain. For example, relatively little data from prospective clinical trials demonstrate the selective efficacy of molecular-targeted therapeutics based on somatic mutations in the patient's tumor. In this commentary, we discuss recent advances in preclinical testing for pediatric cancer and provide recommendations for providing scientific justification and translational relevance for novel therapeutic combinations for childhood cancer.

We present here a novel proteomic approach to this problem using a reference library of stable isotope labeled medulloblastoma-specific proteins as a spike-in standard for accurate quantification of the tumor proteome. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we quantified the tumor proteome of group 3 medulloblastoma cells and demonstrate that high-risk MYC amplified tumors can be segregated based on protein expression patterns. We cross-validated the differentially expressed protein candidates using an independent transcriptomic data set and further confirmed them in a separate cohort of medulloblastoma tissue samples to identify the most robust proteogenomic differences. Interestingly, highly expressed proteins associated with MYC-amplified tumors were significantly related to glycolytic metabolic pathways via alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase (PKM) by heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs). Furthermore, when maintained under hypoxic conditions, these MYC-amplified tumors demonstrated increased viability compared to non-amplified tumors within the same subgroup.

Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is a co-receptor for Wnt signaling that marks highly proliferative stem and progenitor cells in many epithelial tissue types. Wnt signaling instructs neural developmental and homeostatic processes; however, Lgr5 expression in the developing and adult brain has not been characterized. Here we report that Lgr5 is expressed in the postnatal cerebellum during the maturation and synaptogenesis of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), processes controlled by Wnt signaling. Using a transgenic reporter mouse for in vivo Lgr5 expression analysis and lineage tracing, we reveal that Lgr5 specifically identified CGNs and was restricted temporally to the CGN maturation phase within the internal granule layer, but absent in the adult brain. Cells marked by Lgr5 were lineage restricted, post-mitotic and long-lived. The ligand for Lgr5, R-spondin, was secreted in a paracrine fashion that evolved during the maturation of CGNs, which coincided with the Lgr5 expression pattern.

Genetic alterations driving medulloblastoma initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we identify GNAS, encoding the G protein G\u03b1s, as a potent tumor suppressor gene that, when expressed at low levels, defines a subset of aggressive Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven human medulloblastomas. Ablation of the single Gnas gene in anatomically distinct progenitors in mice is sufficient to induce Shh-associated medulloblastomas, which recapitulate their human counterparts. G\u03b1s is highly enriched at the primary cilium of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling by regulating both the cAMP-dependent pathway and ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog pathway components. Elevation in levels of a G\u03b1s effector, cAMP, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in Gnas-ablated mice. Thus, our gain- and loss-of-function studies identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function for G\u03b1s that can be found consistently across Shh-group medulloblastomas of disparate cellular and anatomical origins, highlighting G protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Cyclic AMP", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Medulloblastoma", "Neural Stem Cells", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuelian", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Forensic Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy/Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, School of Preclinical and Forensic Medicine, West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

Genomics has illuminated the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity of medulloblastoma, identifying four distinct molecular subgroups. Group 3 and group 4 subgroup medulloblastomas account for most paediatric cases; yet, oncogenic drivers for these subtypes remain largely unidentified. Here we describe a series of prevalent, highly disparate genomic structural variants, restricted to groups 3 and 4, resulting in specific and mutually exclusive activation of the growth factor independent 1 family proto-oncogenes, GFI1 and GFI1B. Somatic structural variants juxtapose GFI1 or GFI1B coding sequences proximal to active enhancer elements, including super-enhancers, instigating oncogenic activity. Our results, supported by evidence from mouse models, identify GFI1 and GFI1B as prominent medulloblastoma oncogenes and implicate 'enhancer hijacking' as an efficient mechanism driving oncogene

using DNA methylation sequencing.", "Abstract": "Epigenetic alterations, that is, disruption of DNA methylation and chromatin architecture, are now acknowledged as a universal feature of tumorigenesis. Medulloblastoma, a clinically challenging, malignant childhood brain tumour, is no exception. Despite much progress from recent genomics studies, with recurrent changes identified in each of the four distinct tumour subgroups (WNT-pathway-activated, SHH-pathway-activated, and the less-well-characterized Group 3 and Group 4), many cases still lack an obvious genetic driver. Here we present whole-genome bisulphite-sequencing data from thirty-four human and five murine tumours plus eight human and three murine normal controls, augmented with matched whole-genome, RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data. This comprehensive data set allowed us to decipher several features underlying the interplay between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome, and its effects on medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Most notable were highly prevalent regions of hypomethylation correlating with increased gene expression, extending tens of kilobases downstream of transcription start sites. Focal regions of low methylation linked to transcription-factor-binding sites shed light on differential transcriptional networks between subgroups, whereas increased methylation due to re-normalization of repressed chromatin in DNA methylation valleys was positively correlated with gene expression. Large, partially methylated domains affecting up to one-third of the genome showed increased mutation rates and gene silencing in a subgroup-specific fashion. Epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma candidate genes (for example, LIN28B), resulting in alternative promoter usage and/or differential messenger RNA/microRNA expression. Analysis of mouse medulloblastoma and precursor-cell methylation demonstrated a somatic origin for many alterations. Our data provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of transcription and genome organization in medulloblastoma pathogenesis, which are probably also of importance in a wider developmental and disease context.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Chromatin", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Gene Expression

cerebellar, proprioceptive and interoceptive networks. Cell production depends on the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Atoh1. In rhombomere 1, Atoh1-positive cells give rise to both cerebellar neurons and extra-cerebellar nuclei in ventral hindbrain. The origin of this cellular diversity has previously been attributed to temporal signals rather than spatial patterning. Here, we show that in both chick and mouse the cerebellar Atoh1 precursor pool is partitioned into initially cryptic spatial domains that reflect the activity of two different organisers: an isthmic Atoh1 domain, which gives rise to isthmic nuclei, and the rhombic lip, which generates deep cerebellar nuclei and granule cells. We use a combination of in vitro explant culture, genetic fate mapping and gene overexpression and knockdown to explore the role of isthmic signalling in patterning these domains. We show that an FGF-dependent isthmic Atoh1 domain is the origin of distinct populations of Lhx9-positive neurons in the extra-cerebellar isthmic nuclei. In the cerebellum, ectopic FGF induces proliferation while blockade reduces the length of the cerebellar rhombic lip. FGF signalling is not required for the specification of cerebellar cell types from the rhombic lip and its upregulation inhibits their production. This suggests that although the isthmus regulates the size of the cerebellar anlage, the downregulation of isthmic FGF signals is required for induction of rhombic lip-derived cerebellar neurons.", "Keywords": ["Cerebellum", "Chick", "Deep cerebellar nuclei", "FGF receptor knockout", "Gbx2", "Isthmo-optic nucleus", "Lhx9", "Mouse", "Otx2"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Avian Proteins", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cerebellum", "Chick Embryo", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factor 8", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Mesencephalon", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Otx Transcription Factors", "Pregnancy", "Rhombencephalon", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary J", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, 4th floor New Hunt's House, London SE1 1UL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anna M", "Last Name": "Myat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian A", "Last Name": "Emmenegger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leigh J", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard J T", "Last Name": "Wingate", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "24297863", "Title": "BET bromodomain inhibition of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma.", "Abstract": "MYC-amplified medulloblastomas are highly lethal tumors.

However, the clinical and biological implications of TERT mutations in medulloblastoma have not been described. Hence, we sought to describe these mutations and their impact in a subgroup-specific manner. We analyzed the TERT promoter by direct sequencing and genotyping in 466 medulloblastomas. The mutational distributions were determined according to subgroup affiliation, demographics, and clinical, prognostic, and molecular features. Integrated genomics approaches were used to identify specific somatic copy number alterations in TERT promoter-mutated and wild-type tumors. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were identified in 21 % of medulloblastomas. Strikingly, the highest frequencies of TERT mutations were observed in SHH (83 %; 55/66) and WNT (31 %; 4/13) medulloblastomas derived from adult patients. Group 3 and Group 4 harbored this alteration in <5 % of cases and showed no association with increased patient age. The prognostic implications of these mutations were highly subgroup-specific. TERT mutations identified a subset with good and poor prognosis in SHH and Group 4 tumors, respectively. Monosomy 6 was mostly restricted to WNT tumors without TERT mutations. Hallmark SHH focal copy number aberrations and chromosome 10q deletion were mutually exclusive with TERT mutations within SHH tumors.

germinal layer (EGL). Here we identified a rare population of neuronal progenitors in mouse developing cerebellum that expresses Nestin. Although Nestin is widely considered a marker for multipotent stem cells, these Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) are committed to the granule neuron lineage. Unlike conventional GNPs, which reside in the outer EGL and proliferate extensively, NEPs reside in the deep part of the EGL and are quiescent. Expression profiling revealed that NEPs are distinct from GNPs and, in particular, express markedly reduced levels of genes associated with DNA repair. Consistent with this, upon aberrant activation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, NEPs exhibited more severe genomic instability and gave rise to tumors more efficiently than GNPs. These studies revealed a previously unidentified progenitor for cerebellar granule neurons and a cell of origin for medulloblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Cerebellum", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Luminescent Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nestin", "Neurons", "Patched Receptors", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cells", "Tamoxifen"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "1] Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health System, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Although aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have improved outcomes, survivors suffer severe long-term side effects, and many patients still succumb to their disease. For patients whose tumors are driven by mutations in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, SHH antagonists offer some hope. However, many SHH-associated medulloblastomas do not respond to these drugs, and those that do may develop resistance. Therefore, more effective treatment strategies are needed for both SHH and non-SHH-associated medulloblastoma. One such strategy involves targeting the cells that are critical for maintaining tumor growth, known as tumor-propagating cells (TPC). We previously identified a population of TPCs in tumors from patched mutant mice, a model for SHH-dependent medulloblastoma. These cells express the surface antigen CD15/SSEA-1 and have elevated levels of genes associated with the G2-M phases of the cell cycle. Here, we show that CD15(+) cells progress more rapidly through the cell cycle than CD15(-) cells and contain an increased proportion of cells in G2-M, suggesting that they might be vulnerable to inhibitors of this phase. Indeed, exposure of tumor cells to inhibitors of Aurora kinase (Aurk) and Polo-like kinases (Plk), key regulators of G2-M, induces cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and enhanced sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with these agents significantly inhibits tumor progression. Importantly, cells from human patient-derived medulloblastoma xenografts are also sensitive to Aurk and Plk inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting G2-M regulators may represent a novel approach for treatment of human medulloblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aurora Kinase A", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Proliferation", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Medulloblastoma", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Polo-Like Kinase 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shirley L", "Last Name": "Markant", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute; Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine; Departments of Pediatrics, Neurosciences, and Neurosurgery, University of California San Diego, La Jolla; Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, California; Departments of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care, Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, and Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; and Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lourdes Adriana", "Last Name": "Esparza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly L", "Last Name": "Barton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "McCoig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerald A", "Last Name": "Grant", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Crawford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Northcott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Shih", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Remke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Wechsler-Reya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2013Oct15"}, {"PMID": "23178582", "Title": "The role of stem cells and progenitors in the genesis of medulloblastoma.", "Abstract": "Cancer results from dysregulation of growth and survival pathways in normal stem cells and progenitors.
