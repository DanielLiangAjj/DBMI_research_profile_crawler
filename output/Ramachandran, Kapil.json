Here, we investigated the in\u00a0vivo function of the 20S neuronal membrane proteasome (NMP) in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. With biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we demonstrated that NMPs are conserved in the tadpole brain and preferentially degrade neuronal activity-induced newly synthesized proteins in\u00a0vivo. Using in\u00a0vivo calcium imaging in the optic tectum, we showed that acute NMP inhibition rapidly increased spontaneous neuronal activity, resulting in hypersynchronization across tectal neurons. At the circuit level, inhibiting NMPs abolished learning-dependent improvement in visuomotor behavior in live animals and caused a significant deterioration in basal behavioral performance following visual training with enhanced visual experience. Our data provide in\u00a0vivo characterization of NMP functions in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest that NMP-mediated degradation of activity-induced nascent proteins may serve as a homeostatic modulatory mechanism in neurons that is critical for regulating neuronal activity and experience-dependent circuit plasticity.", "Keywords": ["BONCAT", "activity-induced nascent proteins", "neuron", "proteasome", "spontaneous activity"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Neurons", "Superior Colliculi", "Tectum Mesencephali", "Xenopus laevis", "Avoidance Learning", "Larva", "Neuronal Plasticity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hai-Yan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Arifa", "Last Name": "Ahsan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Reshmi", "Last Name": "Bera", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "McLain", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Regina", "Last Name": "Faulkner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Kapil V", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Seth S", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "Hollis T", "Last Name": "Cline", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jan17"}, {"PMID": "29979964", "Title": "Activity-Dependent Degradation of the Nascentome by the Neuronal Membrane Proteasome.", "Abstract": "Activity-dependent changes in neuronal function require coordinated regulation of the protein synthesis and protein degradation machinery to maintain protein homeostasis, critical for proper neuronal function. However, the biochemical evidence for this balance and coordination is largely lacking. Leveraging our recent discovery of a neuronal-specific 20S membrane proteasome complex (NMP), we began exploring how neuronal activity regulates its function. Here, we found that the NMP degrades exclusively a large fraction of ribosome-associated nascent polypeptides that are being newly synthesized during neuronal stimulation. Using deep-coverage and global mass spectrometry, we identified the nascent protein substrates of the NMP, which included products encoding immediate-early genes, such as c-Fos and Npas4. Intriguingly, we found that turnover of nascent polypeptides and not full-length proteins through the NMP occurred independent of canonical ubiquitylation pathways. We propose that these findings generally define a neuronal activity-induced protein homeostasis program of coordinated protein synthesis and degradation through the NMP.", "Keywords": ["immediate early gene", "membrane proteasome", "nascent polypeptide", "neuronal activity", "proteasome", "ribosome"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cell Membrane", "Mice", "Neurons", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Proteolysis", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kapil V", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

It is unclear how proteasomes are able to acutely regulate such processes, as this action is inconsistent with their canonical role in proteostasis. Here we describe a mammalian nervous-system-specific membrane proteasome complex that directly and rapidly modulates neuronal function by degrading intracellular proteins into extracellular peptides that can stimulate neuronal signaling. This proteasome complex is closely associated with neuronal plasma membranes, exposed to the extracellular space, and catalytically active. Selective inhibition of the membrane proteasome complex by a cell-impermeable proteasome inhibitor blocked the production of extracellular peptides and attenuated neuronal-activity-induced calcium signaling. Moreover, we observed that membrane-proteasome-derived peptides were sufficient to induce neuronal calcium signaling. Our discoveries challenge the prevailing notion that proteasomes function primarily to maintain proteostasis, and highlight a form of neuronal communication that takes place through a membrane proteasome complex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cytoplasm", "Extracellular Space", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Mammals", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Models, Biological", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nervous System", "Neurons", "Oligopeptides", "Peptides", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Protein Subunits", "Proteolysis", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kapil V", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seth S", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature structural & molecular biology", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "25536179", "Title": "Calcium signaling regulates ventricular hypertrophy during development independent of contraction or blood flow.", "Abstract": "In utero interventions aimed at restoring left ventricular hemodynamic forces in fetuses with prenatally diagnosed hypoplastic left heart syndrome failed to stimulate ventricular myocardial growth during gestation, suggesting chamber growth during development may not rely upon fluid forces. We therefore hypothesized that ventricular hypertrophy during development may depend upon fundamental Ca(2+)-dependent growth pathways that function independent of hemodynamic forces. To test this hypothesis, zebrafish embryos were treated with inhibitors or activators of Ca(2+) signaling in the presence or absence of contraction during the period of chamber development. Abolishment of contractile function alone in the setting of preserved Ca(2+) signaling did not impair ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, inhibition of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx abolished contraction and led to reduced ventricular hypertrophy, whereas increasing L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx led to enhanced ventricular hypertrophy in either the presence or absence of contraction. Similarly, inhibition of the downstream Ca(2+)-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin, a known regulator of adult cardiac hypertrophy, led to reduced ventricular hypertrophy in the presence or absence of contraction, whereas hypertrophy was rescued in the absence of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx and contraction by expression of a constitutively active calcineurin. These data suggest that ventricular cardiomyocyte hypertrophy during chamber formation is dependent upon Ca(2+) signaling pathways that are unaffected by heart function or hemodynamic forces. Disruption of Ca(2+)-dependent hypertrophy during heart development may therefore represent one mechanism for impaired chamber formation that is not related to impaired blood flow.", "Keywords": ["Calcium", "Congenital heart defects", "Development", "Hypertrophy", "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Calcineurin", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Calcium Signaling", "Cardiomegaly", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hemodynamics", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Regional Blood Flow", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas D", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery (Cardiovascular and Thoracic), Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.

Understanding how multiple signals within niches integrate to control stem cell function is challenging. The Drosophila testis stem cell niche consists of somatic hub cells that maintain both germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Here, we show a role for the axon guidance pathway Slit-Roundabout (Robo) in the testis niche. The ligand Slit is expressed specifically in hub cells while its receptor, Roundabout 2 (Robo2), is required in CySCs in order for them to compete for occupancy in the niche. CySCs also require the Slit-Robo effector Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) to prevent over-adhesion of CySCs to the niche, and CySCs mutant for Abl outcompete wild type CySCs for niche occupancy. Both Robo2 and Abl phenotypes can be rescued through modulation of adherens junction components, suggesting that the two work together to balance CySC adhesion levels. Interestingly, expression of Robo2 requires JAK-STAT signaling, an important maintenance pathway for both germline and cyst stem cells in the testis. Our work indicates that Slit-Robo signaling affects stem cell function downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway by controlling the ability of stem cells to compete for occupancy in their niche.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Germ Cells", "Humans", "Janus Kinases", "Male", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Receptors, Immunologic", "STAT Transcription Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cell Niche", "Stem Cells", "Testis", "Roundabout Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel R", "Last Name": "Stine", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leah J", "Last Name": "Greenspan", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kapil V", "Last Name": "Ramachandran", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Erika L", "Last Name": "Matunis", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2014Nov"}, {"PMID": "23549079", "Title": "Calcium influx through L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels regulates mandibular development.", "Abstract": "The identification of a gain-of-function mutation in CACNA1C as the cause of Timothy Syndrome (TS), a rare disorder characterized by cardiac arrhythmias and syndactyly, highlighted unexpected roles for the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 in nonexcitable cells. How abnormal Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 underlies phenotypes such as the accompanying syndactyly or craniofacial abnormalities in the majority of affected individuals is not readily explained by established CaV1.2 roles. Here, we show that CaV1.2 is expressed in the first and second pharyngeal arches within the subset of cells that give rise to jaw primordia. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in mouse, in concert with knockdown/rescue and pharmacological approaches in zebrafish, demonstrated that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 regulates jaw development. Cranial neural crest migration was unaffected by CaV1.2 knockdown, suggesting a role for CaV1.2 later in development.
