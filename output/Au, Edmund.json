Current studies linking individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to AS in a few neuron types underscore the need for holistic modeling. Here, we use network reverse engineering to derive a map of the neuron type-specific AS regulatory landscape from 133 mouse neocortical cell types defined by single-cell transcriptomes. This approach reliably inferred the regulons of 350 RBPs and their cell type-specific activities. Our analysis revealed driving factors delineating neuronal identities, among which we validated Elavl2 as a key RBP for MGE-specific splicing in GABAergic interneurons using an in vitro ESC differentiation system. We also identified a module of exons and candidate regulators specific for long- and short-projection neurons across multiple neuronal classes.

We started by training a model that recognizes pre- and post-synaptic compartments and then determines the target of each genetically-identified interneuron synapse in vitro and in vivo. Our model extracts hundreds of spatial and intensity features from each analyzed synapse, constructing a multidimensional data set, consisting of millions of synapses, which allowed us to perform an unsupervised analysis on this dataset, uncovering novel synaptic subgroups. The subgroups were spatially distributed in a highly structured manner that revealed the local underlying topology of the postsynaptic environment. Dendrite-targeting subgroups were clustered onto subdomains of the dendrite along the proximal to distal axis. Soma-targeting subgroups were enriched onto different postsynaptic cell types.
