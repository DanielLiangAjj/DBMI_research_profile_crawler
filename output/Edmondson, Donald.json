We combined user-centered design (UCD) and implementation science (ImS) principles to design a novel telehealth-enhanced hybrid (home and clinic-based) CR (THCR) program. Methods As part of a New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) quality improvement initiative (March 2020-February 2022), we designed a THCR program using an iterative 3 step UCD process informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to: 1) identify user and contextual barriers to CR uptake (stakeholder interviews), 2) design an intervention prototype (design workshops and journey mapping), and 3) refine the prototype (usability testing). The process was optimized for usability and implementation outcomes. Results Step 1: Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (n\u2009=\u20099) at 3 geographically diverse academic medical centers revealed behavioral (e.g., self-efficacy, knowledge) and contextual (e.g., social distancing guidelines, physical space, staffing, reimbursement) barriers to uptake. Step 2: Design workshops (n\u2009=\u200920) and journey-mapping sessions (n\u2009=\u20093) with multi-disciplinary NYPH stakeholders (e.g., digital health team, CR clinicians, creative director) yielded a THCR prototype that leveraged NYPH's investment in their remote patient monitoring (RPM) platform to optimize feasibility of home-based CR sessions. Step 3: Usability testing with CR clinicians (n\u2009=\u20092) administering and CR patients (n\u2009=\u20093) participating in home-based sessions revealed usability challenges (e.g., RPM devices/exercise equipment usability; Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity/syncing; patient safety/knowledge and protocol flexibility). Design workshops (n\u2009=\u200924) and journey-mapping sessions (n\u2009=\u20093) yielded design solutions (e.g., onboarding sessions, safety surveys, fully supervised remote sessions) and a refined THCR prototype. Conclusion Combining UCD and ImS methods while engaging multi-disciplinary stakeholders in an iterative process yielded a theory-informed telehealth-enhanced hybrid CR program targeting user and contextual barriers to real-world CR implementation. We provide a detailed summary of the process, and guidance for incorporating UCD and ImS methods in early-stage intervention development.

Using ecological momentary assessment, we tested whether usual exercise level moderates the relationship of self-reported anxiety to concurrent ambulatory heart rate (HR) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP). Participants (N\u2009=\u2009832) completed 24-h ambulatory monitoring of HR/BP, using a brachial BP cuff that took readings at 28-min intervals. Anxiety levels were concurrently reported on a visual analog scale (VAS) using a Palm Pilot. Usual exercise behavior was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. Random coefficients linear regression models predicting momentary HR/BP readings from time-matched anxiety scores were estimated, yielding the average within-person effect (slope) of anxiety. The interaction of exercise level (i.e., no weekly exercise, 1-149, and \u2265\u2009150\u00a0min/week; a between-person factor) with anxiety was added to the model in order to estimate the average anxiety slope for participants in each exercise category. The relationship of HR/BP to anxiety did not differ significantly among exercise categories, hence not providing evidence for the cross-stressor hypothesis. In an exploratory analysis of the difference in HR/BP between occasions when anxiety was in the top versus bottom person-specific quintiles of responses, the difference in HR (but not SBP or DBP) varied significantly by exercise level (F(2,625)\u2009=\u20094.92, p\u2009=\u20090.008).

Several studies indicate that sexual minority women (SMW) and bisexual men may be at highest risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but limited research has examined physiological CVD risk or racial/ethnic differences. This study sought to examine racial/ethnic differences in physiological risk factors for CVD among sexual minority and heterosexual adults.Design: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2016) using sex-stratified multiple linear regression models to estimate differences in physiological CVD risk. We compared sexual minorities (gay/lesbian, bisexual, 'not sure') to heterosexual participants first without regard to race/ethnicity. Then we compared sexual minorities by race/ethnicity to White heterosexual participants.Results: The sample included 22,305 participants (ages 18-59). Lesbian women had higher body mass index (BMI) but lower total cholesterol than heterosexual women. Bisexual women had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP). Gay men had lower BMI and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) relative to heterosexual men. White and Black lesbian women and bisexual women of all races/ethnicities had higher BMI than White heterosexual women; Black bisexual women had higher SBP and HbA1c. Black sexual minority men had higher HbA1c relative to White heterosexual men. Latino 'not sure' men also had higher SBP, HbA1c, and total cholesterol than White heterosexual men.Conclusions: Given evidence of higher CVD risk in sexual minority people of color relative to White heterosexuals, there is a need for health promotion initiatives to address these disparities. Additional research that incorporates longitudinal designs and examines the influence of psychosocial stressors on CVD risk in sexual minorities is recommended.

Invasive coronary revascularization procedures are commonly used to reduce secondary ACS risk and may reduce patients' EST, as revascularized patients often report being \"cured.\" We assessed ACS patients' initial threat perceptions during emergency department (ED) evaluation and followed them for 1 month for PTSD symptoms (specific for ACS, by telephone). We compared PTSD symptoms in participants who were revascularized (n = 65), catheterized but not revascularized (n = 35), and medically managed (n = 43). PTSD symptoms were lower for revascularized versus medically managed participants (B = -5.32, 95% confidence interval [-9.77, -0.87]), t(98.19) = -2.37, p = .020. In a multiple regression model adjusted for clinical and psychosocial covariates, the interaction of threat perception in the ED and ACS management group was significant (greater ED threat predicted greater 1-month PTSD symptoms only in medically managed participants). These findings offer further support for the EST model and suggest that psychological interventions to preempt patients' development of EST should be considered in the hospital.

Research suggests that younger, versus older, individuals may be at elevated risk for PSS after ACS evaluation. It has been proposed that younger individuals may be at greater risk because they perceive the suspected ACS event as more threatening than their older counterparts; however, this has yet to be tested. We examined whether perceived threat during ACS evaluation mediated the association between age and PSS after ACS evaluation in an observational cohort study of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected ACS. Demographics and perceived threat were assessed in the ED. PSS were measured upon inpatient transfer or by phone 3\u00a0days later. The analytic sample comprised 871 adult participants. Multiple linear regression was used to examine (1) associations of age and perceived threat with PSS and (2) whether perceived threat mediated the association. Bootstrapping with percentile-based confidence intervals (CIs) was used to test the indirect effect. Each year of age was associated with lower PSS (b\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.12, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), independent of covariates. Older age was associated with lower perceived threat during ACS evaluation (b\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

In this design, the effect of an intervention on one group of patients is compared with the effect of a control condition on another group of patients, such that a between-subject change is tested. A between-subject design has an underlying assumption that there is a homogenous treatment effect for a behavioral intervention, drug or psychotherapy, and that the way the intervention operates in the study that will tend to operate in the same way in many other patients. We review some of the philosophical and practical problems with the use of this design when a clinician is attempting to decide on a course of behavioral treatment aimed at within-subject change in patients who are likely to have heterogeneous or unique responses to behavioral treatment. We also review the biases inherent in our current clinical practice model, which does not use any empirical data collection or design for testing if a treatment is useful, and also in the conventional between-subject personalized medicine RCT designs. We propose increased use of single-patient (also known as N-of-1) trials that employ within-subject designs, in cases where treatment response is heterogeneous-as is the case for most psychological and behavioral treatments. Limitations of such designs include that they can only be used when the treatment is potentially reversible, the patient can act as their own control, and the outcome can be measured repeatedly. Increased use of within-subject trials may address in many more instances the more clinically relevant question of how a specific patient will respond to a specific treatment, and could introduce a more harmonious scientific approach into the way we treat our patients.

We then apply the Perfect Storm conceptualization to describe a program of research concerning a psychosocial vulnerability factor that contributes to increased risk of recurrent ACS and early mortality, and that has defied our efforts to identify underlying pathophysiology and successfully mount efforts to fully mitigate this risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Circulation", "Coronary Thrombosis", "Depression", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Prognosis", "Recurrence", "Risk Factors", "Rupture, Spontaneous", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew M", "Last Name": "Burg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Cardiovascular Behavioral Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Edmondson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Shaffer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Kronish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Whang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmela", "Last Name": "Alc\u00e1ntara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Muntner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karina W", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Progress in cardiovascular diseases", "PubDate": "2013May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "23621964", "Title": "Posttraumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease.", "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder initiated by exposure to a traumatic event and characterized by intrusive thoughts about the event, attempts to avoid reminders of the event, and physiological hyperarousal. In a number of large prospective observational studies, PTSD has been associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Also, in recent years, a number of studies have shown that cardiovascular events can themselves cause PTSD in more than 1 in 8 patients with acute coronary syndrome. Further, a few small studies suggest that PTSD secondary to an acute CVD event then places patients at increased risk for subsequent CVD events and mortality. In this article, we review the evidence for a link between PTSD and CVD, and discuss potential mechanisms for that association as well as future directions for research.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Comorbidity", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Incidence", "Mental Health", "Prevalence", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Edmondson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA. dee2109@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Beth E", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Progress in cardiovascular diseases", "PubDate": "2013May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "23621960", "Title": "Symposium on psychosocial factors in cardiovascular disease.

Observational studies have found repeatedly that patients report excessive anger, anxiety, sadness, grief, or acute stress immediately prior to onset of MI, and recent meta-analyses summarizing these findings reported strong associations between MI occurrence and many of these acute emotions. However, it is unclear whether and through what mechanisms acute emotional triggers might influence MI, and whether there is any clinical utility in knowing if or how emotions trigger MI. We debate whether emotional triggers matter by reviewing the recent evidence for the association between acute emotional triggers and MI and by describing the potential pathophysiological characteristics and mechanisms underlying this association and the preventive strategies that could be used to mitigate the risk of acute MI. We also examine whether the study of emotional triggers could influence clinical risk management or changes in clinical practice/management. We offer suggestions for research that might shed light on whether emotional triggers could initiate a paradigm shift in preventive cardiology, or whether acute emotional triggers are either intractable catalysts for, or merely an epiphenomenon of, some MIs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anxiety Disorders", "Conflict, Psychological", "Depressive Disorder", "Disease Models, Animal", "Emotions", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Myocardial Infarction", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Edmondson", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Newman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Whang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karina W", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "European heart journal", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
