Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are a diverse family of molecular receptors that are activated by chemicals, temperature changes, and tissue damage. In non-neuronal cells, TRP channels play roles in inflammation, tissue development, and maintenance. In somatosensory neurons, TRP channels mediate nociception, thermosensation, and chemosensation. To assess whether TRP channels might be involved in environmental sensing in the human oral cavity, we investigated their distribution in human tongue and hard palate biopsies.

TRPA1 immunoreactivity was present in fibroblasts, immune cells, and neuronal afferents, consistent with known roles of TRPA1 in sensory transduction and response to damage and inflammation.

We previously reported that local OB interneurons secrete the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in an activity-dependent manner onto adult-born granule neurons and that local CRH signaling promotes expression of synaptic machinery in the bulb. This effect is mediated via activation of the CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1), which is developmentally regulated during adult-born neuron maturation. CRHR1 is a GS-protein-coupled receptor that activates CREB-dependent transcription in the presence of CRH. Therefore, we hypothesized that locally secreted CRH activates CRHR1 to initiate circuit plasticity programs. To identify such programs, we profiled gene expression changes associated with CRHR1 activity in adult-born neurons of the OB. Here, we show that CRHR1 activity influences expression of the brain-specific Homeobox-containing transcription factor POU Class 6 Homeobox 1 (POU6f1). To elucidate the contributions of POU6f1 toward activity-dependent circuit remodeling, we targeted CRHR1+ neurons in male and female mice for cell-type-specific manipulation of POU6f1 expression. Whereas loss of POU6f1 in CRHR1+ neurons resulted in reduced dendritic complexity and decreased synaptic connectivity, overexpression of POU6f1 in CRHR1+ neurons promoted dendritic outgrowth and branching and influenced synaptic function. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional program directed by POU6f1 downstream of local CRH signaling in adult-born neurons influences circuit dynamics in response to activity-dependent peptide signaling in the adult brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Elucidating mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain is helpful for devising strategies to understand and treat neurodegeneration. Circuit plasticity in the adult mouse olfactory bulb is exemplified by both continued cell integration and synaptogenesis. We previously reported that these processes are influenced by local neuropeptide signaling in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we show that local corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling induces dynamic gene expression changes in CRH receptor expressing adult-born neurons, including altered expression of the transcription factor POU6f1 We further show that POU6f1 is necessary for proper dendrite specification and patterning, as well as synapse development and function in adult-born neurons.

Previously, we identified mutations in SPATA7, encoding spermatogenesis associated protein 7, in families with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and juvenile Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), and showed that Spata7 null mice recapitulate the human disease phenotype of retinal degeneration. SPATA7 is expressed in the connecting cilium of photoreceptor (PR) cells in the mouse retina, as well as in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, but the functional role of Spata7 in the RPE remains unknown. To investigate whether Spata7 is required in PRs, the RPE, or both, we conditionally knocked out Spata7 in photoreceptors and RPE cells using Crx-Cre and Best1-Cre transgenic mouse lines, respectively. In Spata7 photoreceptor-specific conditional (cKO) mice, both rod and cone photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration is observed, characterized by progressive thinning of the outer nuclear layer and reduced response to light; however, RPE-specific deletion of Spata7 does not impair retinal function or cell survival. Furthermore, our findings show that both Rhodopsin and RPGRIP1 are mislocalized in the Spata7Flox/-; Crx-Cre cKO mice, suggesting that loss of Spata7 in photoreceptors alone can result in altered trafficking of these proteins in the connecting cilium. Together, our findings suggest that loss of Spata7 in photoreceptors alone is sufficient to cause photoreceptor degeneration, but its function in the RPE is not required for photoreceptor survival; therefore, loss of Spata7 in photoreceptors alters both rod and cone function and survival, consistent with the clinical phenotypes observed in LCA and RP patients with mutations in SPATA7.", "Keywords": ["Conditional knockout", "Leber Congenital Amaurosis", "Photoreceptors", "RPE", "Retinal degeneration", "Retinal function", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "SPATA7"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroretinography", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Proteins", "Retina", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Rhodopsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aiden", "Last Name": "Eblimit", "Affiliation": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA."}, {"First Name": "Smriti Akshay", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kandace", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivan Assenov", "Last Name": "Anastassov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tajiguli", "Last Name": "Abulikemu", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"First Name": "Yalda", "Last Name": "Moayedi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Graeme", "Last Name": "Mardon", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA; Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA.

SPATA7 has recently been identified as the LCA3 and juvenile RP gene in humans, whose function in the retina remains elusive. Here, we show that SPATA7 localizes at the primary cilium of cells and at the connecting cilium (CC) of photoreceptor cells, indicating that SPATA7 is a ciliary protein. In addition, SPATA7 directly interacts with the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1), a key connecting cilium protein that has also been linked to LCA. In the retina of Spata7 null mutant mice, a substantial reduction of RPGRIP1 levels at the CC of photoreceptor cells is observed, suggesting that SPATA7 is required for the stable assembly and localization of the ciliary RPGRIP1 protein complex. Furthermore, our results pinpoint a role of this complex in protein trafficking across the CC to the outer segments, as we identified that rhodopsin accumulates in the inner segments and around the nucleus of photoreceptors. This accumulation then likely triggers the apoptosis of rod photoreceptors that was observed. Loss of Spata7 function in mice indeed results in a juvenile RP-like phenotype, characterized by progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells and a strongly decreased light response. Together, these results indicate that SPATA7 functions as a key member of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex, and that apoptosis of rod photoreceptor cells triggered by protein mislocalization is likely the mechanism of disease progression in LCA3/ juvenile RP patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cattle", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Gene Deletion", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Photoreceptor Connecting Cilium", "Protein Transport", "Proteins", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells", "Rhodopsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aiden", "Last Name": "Eblimit", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Thanh-Minh T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yiyun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Esteve-Rudd", "Affiliation": "Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology."}, {"First Name": "Stef", "Last Name": "Letteboer", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jeroen", "Last Name": "Van Reeuwijk", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Simons", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ka Man", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yumei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Sylvia", "Last Name": "Van Beersum", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yalda", "Last Name": "Moayedi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and."}, {"First Name": "Huidan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Pickard", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Keqing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Gan", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel M", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Graeme", "Last Name": "Mardon", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Department of Neuroscience and Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA, ruichen@bcm.edu roepman@radboudumc.nl gmardon@bcm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Roepman", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6525, The Netherlands, ruichen@bcm.edu roepman@radboudumc.nl gmardon@bcm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "HGSC, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, ruichen@bcm.edu roepman@radboudumc.nl gmardon@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2015Mar15"}, {"PMID": "24920025", "Title": "Vibration of the organ of Corti within the cochlear apex in mice.", "Abstract": "The tonotopic map of the mammalian cochlea is commonly thought to be determined by the passive mechanical properties of the basilar membrane. The other tissues and cells that make up the organ of Corti also have passive mechanical properties; however, their roles are less well understood. In addition, active forces produced by outer hair cells (OHCs) enhance the vibration of the basilar membrane, termed cochlear amplification. Here, we studied how these biomechanical components interact using optical coherence tomography, which permits vibratory measurements within tissue. We measured not only classical basilar membrane tuning curves, but also vibratory responses from the rest of the organ of Corti within the mouse cochlear apex in vivo. As expected, basilar membrane tuning was sharp in live mice and broad in dead mice. Interestingly, the vibratory response of the region lateral to the OHCs, the \"lateral compartment,\" demonstrated frequency-dependent phase differences relative to the basilar membrane. This was sharply tuned in both live and dead mice. We then measured basilar membrane and lateral compartment vibration in transgenic mice with targeted alterations in cochlear mechanics. Prestin(499/499), Prestin(-/-), and Tecta(C1509G/C1509G) mice demonstrated no cochlear amplification but maintained the lateral compartment phase difference. In contrast, Sfswap(Tg/Tg) mice maintained cochlear amplification but did not demonstrate the lateral compartment phase difference. These data indicate that the organ of Corti has complex micromechanical vibratory characteristics, with passive, yet sharply tuned, vibratory characteristics associated with the supporting cells.
