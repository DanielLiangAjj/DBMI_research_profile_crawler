Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. Recruiting endogenous NEDD4-2 to diverse ion channel proteins (KCNQ1, ENaC, and CaV2.2) using a divalent (DiVa) nanobody format strongly reduced their functional expression with minimal off-target effects as assessed by global proteomics, compared to simple NEDD4-2 overexpression. The results establish utility of a HECT E3 ligase for targeted protein downregulation, validate a class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins as susceptible to this modality, and introduce endogenous E3 ligase recruitment with DiVa nanobodies as a general method to generate novel genetically-encoded ion channel inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Travis J", "Last Name": "Morgenstern", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Arden", "Last Name": "Darko-Boateng", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Afriyie", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sri Karthika", "Last Name": "Shanmugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Xinle", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Papiya", "Last Name": "Choudhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Meera", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "The Potomac School, McLean, VA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May31"}, {"PMID": "37650513", "Title": "Divergent regulation of KCNQ1/E1 by targeted recruitment of protein kinase A to distinct sites on the channel complex.", "Abstract": "The slow delayed rectifier potassium current, IKs, conducted through pore-forming Q1 and auxiliary E1 ion channel complexes is important for human cardiac action potential repolarization. During exercise or fright, IKs is up-regulated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Q1 phosphorylation to maintain heart rhythm and optimum cardiac performance. Sympathetic up-regulation of IKs requires recruitment of PKA holoenzyme (two regulatory - RI or RII - and two catalytic C\u03b1 subunits) to Q1 C-terminus by an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP9). Mutations in Q1 or AKAP9 that abolish their functional interaction result in long QT syndrome type 1 and 11, respectively, which increases the risk of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Here, we investigated the utility of a targeted protein phosphorylation (TPP) approach to reconstitute PKA regulation of IKs in the absence of AKAP9. Targeted recruitment of endogenous C\u03b1 to E1-YFP using a GFP/YFP nanobody (nano) fused to RII\u03b1 enabled acute cAMP-mediated enhancement of IKs, reconstituting physiological regulation of the channel complex. By contrast, nano-mediated tethering of RII\u03b1 or C\u03b1 to Q1-YFP constitutively inhibited IKs by retaining the channel intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Proteomic analysis revealed that distinct phosphorylation sites are modified by C\u03b1 targeted to Q1-YFP compared to free C\u03b1. Thus, functional outcomes of synthetically recruited PKA on IKs regulation is critically dependent on the site of recruitment within the channel complex. The results reveal insights into divergent regulation of IKs by phosphorylation across different spatial and time scales, and suggest a TPP approach to develop new drugs to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.", "Keywords": ["KCNQ1", "biochemistry", "cell biology", "chemical biology", "induced proximity", "ion channel regulation", "ion channel trafficking", "long QT syndrome", "none", "phosphorylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "KCNQ1 Potassium Channel", "Proteomics", "Action Potentials", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinle", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sri Karthika", "Last Name": "Shanmugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2023Aug31"}, {"PMID": "37555447", "Title": "Calmodulin mutations can underlie the phenotype of long QT syndrome variant 1.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["CALM-2", "IKS potassium channel", "calmodulin", "long QT syndrome"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Calmodulin", "Mutation", "Long QT Syndrome", "Phenotype", "KCNQ1 Potassium Channel"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2023Sep"}, {"PMID": "37465897", "Title": "Identification of interacting neural populations: methods and statistical considerations.", "Abstract": "As improved recording technologies have created new opportunities for neurophysiological investigation, emphasis has shifted from individual neurons to multiple populations that form circuits, and it has become important to provide evidence of cross-population coordinated activity.

LQT1 and LQT5 are LQTS variants caused by mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes respectively. KCNQ1 and KCNE1 co-assemble to form critical IKS potassium channels. Beta-blockers are the standard of care for the treatment of LQT1, however, doing so based on mechanisms other than correcting the loss-of-function of K+ channels. ML277 and R-L3 are compounds that enhance IKS channels and slow channel deactivation in a manner that is dependent on the stoichiometry of KCNE1 subunits in the assembled channels. In this paper, we used expression of IKS channels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Xenopus oocytes to study the potential of these two drugs (ML277 and R-L3) for the rescue of LQT1 and LQT5 mutant channels. We focused on the LQT1 mutation KCNQ1-S546L, and two LQT5 mutations, KCNE1-L51H and KCNE1-G52R. We found ML277 and R-L3 potentiated homozygote LQTS mutations in the IKS complexes-KCNE1-G52R and KCNE1-L51H and in heterogeneous IKS channel complexes which mimic heterogeneous expression of mutations in patients. ML277 and R-L3 increased the mutant IKS current amplitude and slowed current deactivation, but not in wild type (WT) IKS. We obtained similar results in the LQT1 mutant (KCNQ1 S546L/KCNE1) with ML277 and R-L3. ML277 and R-L3 had a similar effect on the LQT1 and LQT5 mutants, however, ML277 was more effective than R-L3 in this modulation. Importantly we found that not all LQT5 mutants expressed with KCNQ1 resulted in channels that are potentiated by these drugs as the KCNE1 mutant D76N inhibited drug action when expressed with KCNQ1. Thus, our work shows that by directly studying the treatment of LQT1 and LQT5 mutations with ML277 and R-L3, we will understand the potential utility of these activators as options in specific LQTS therapeutics.", "Keywords": ["IKS", "KCNE1", "KCNQ1", "long QT syndrome", "pharmacology", "potassium channel"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinle", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoan", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "H Peter", "Last Name": "Larsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36321709", "Title": "Population burst propagation across interacting areas of the brain.", "Abstract": "For many perceptual and behavioral tasks, a prominent feature of neural spike trains involves high firing rates across relatively short intervals of time. We call these events \"population bursts.\" Because during a population burst information is, presumably, transmitted from one part of the brain to another, burst timing should reveal activity related to the flow of information across neural circuits. We developed a statistical method (based on a point process model) of determining, accurately, the time of the maximum (peak) population firing rate on a trial-by-trial basis and used it to characterize burst propagation across areas. We then examined the tendency of peak firing rates in distinct brain areas to shift earlier or later in time, together, across repeated trials, and found this trial-to-trial coupling of peak times to be a sensitive indicator of interaction across populations. In the data we examined, from the Allen Brain Observatory, we found many very strong correlations (95% confidence intervals above 0.75) in cases where standard methods were unable to demonstrate cross-area correlation. The statistical model introduced cross-area covariation only through population-level trial-dependent time shifts and gain constants (values of which were learned from the data), yet it provided very good fits to data histograms, including histograms of spike count correlations within and across visual areas. Our results demonstrate the utility of carefully assessing timing and propagation, across brain regions, of transient bursts in neural population activity, based on multiple spike train recordings.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a novel statistical method for identifying coordinated propagation of activity across populations of spiking neurons, with high temporal accuracy.

Because a product of circles is a torus, a d-dimensional vector of circular random variables lies on a d-dimensional torus. For such vectors we present here a class of graphical models, which we call torus graphs, based on the full exponential family with pairwise interactions. The topological distinction between a torus and Euclidean space has several important consequences. Our development was motivated by the problem of identifying phase coupling among oscillatory signals recorded from multiple electrodes in the brain: oscillatory phases across electrodes might tend to advance or recede together, indicating coordination across brain areas. The data analyzed here consisted of 24 phase angles measured repeatedly across 840 experimental trials (replications) during a memory task, where the electrodes were in 4 distinct brain regions, all known to be active while memories are being stored or retrieved. In realistic numerical simulations, we found that a standard pairwise assessment, known as phase locking value, is unable to describe multivariate phase interactions, but that torus graphs can accurately identify conditional associations. Torus graphs generalize several more restrictive approaches that have appeared in various scientific literatures, and produced intuitive results in the data we analyzed.

The A-kinase anchoring protein Yotiao facilitates macromolecular complex formation between IKs and protein kinase A (PKA) to regulate phosphorylation of KCNQ1 and IKs currents following beta-adrenergic stimulation. We have previously shown that adenylyl cyclase Type 9 (AC9) is associated with a KCNQ1-Yotiao-PKA complex and facilitates isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of KCNQ1 in an immortalized cell line. However, requirement for AC9 in sympathetic control of IKs in the heart was unknown. Using a transgenic mouse strain expressing the KCNQ1-KCNE1 subunits of IKs, we show that AC9 is the only adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoform associated with the KCNQ1-KCNE1-Yotiao complex in the heart. Deletion of AC9 resulted in the loss of isoproterenol-stimulated KCNQ1 phosphorylation in vivo, even though AC9 represents less than 3% of total cardiac AC activity. Importantly, a significant reduction of isoproterenol-stimulated IKs currents was also observed in adult cardiomyocytes from IKs-expressing AC9KO mice. AC9 and Yotiao co-localize with N-cadherin, a marker of intercalated disks and cell-cell junctions, in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes, respectively. In conclusion, AC9 is necessary for sympathetic regulation of PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 in vivo and for functional regulation of IKs in adult cardiomyocytes.", "Keywords": ["A-kinase anchoring protein", "AC9", "AKAP", "KCNQ1", "Yotiao", "adenylyl cyclase", "cardiomyocyte", "cyclic AMP", "potassium channels", "protein kinase A"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenylyl Cyclases", "Animals", "Isoproterenol", "KCNQ1 Potassium Channel", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Phosphorylation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Hof", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanya A", "Last Name": "Baldwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carmen W", "Last Name": "Dessauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. carmen.w.dessauer@uth.tmc.edu."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2019Aug27"}, {"PMID": "31231899", "Title": "Exploring spatiotemporal neural dynamics of the human visual cortex.", "Abstract": "The human visual cortex is organized in a hierarchical manner.

These correlation profiles indicate an early-to-late shift from low-level features to high-level features and from low-level regions to higher-level regions along the visual hierarchy, consistent with feedforward information flow. Additionally, we computed three sets of features from the low- and high-level features provided by the neural network: object-category-relevant low-level features (the common components between low-level and high-level features), low-level features roughly orthogonal to high-level features (the residual Layer 1 features), and unique high-level features that were roughly orthogonal to low-level features (the residual Layer 7 features). Contrasting the correlation effects of the common components and the residual Layer 1 features, we observed that the early visual cortex (EVC) exhibited a similar amount of correlation with the two feature sets early in time, but in a later time window, the EVC exhibited a higher and longer correlation effect with the common components (i.e., the low-level object-category-relevant features) than with the low-level residual features-an effect unlikely to arise from purely feedforward information flow.

A natural framework for addressing questions of functional connectivity is to apply Gaussian graphical modeling to neural data, where each edge in the graph corresponds to a non-zero partial correlation between neurons. Because the number of possible edges is large, one strategy for estimating the graph has been to apply methods that aim to identify large sparse effects using an [Formula: see text] penalty. However, the partial correlations found in neural spike count data are neither large nor sparse, so techniques that perform well in sparse settings will typically perform poorly in the context of neural spike count data. Fortunately, the correlated firing for any pair of cortical neurons depends strongly on both their distance apart and the features for which they are tuned. We introduce a method that takes advantage of these known, strong effects by allowing the penalty to depend on them: thus, for example, the connection between pairs of neurons that are close together will be penalized less than pairs that are far apart.

For a single stationary time series in each of two brain areas statistical tools such as cross-correlation and Granger causality may be applied. On the other hand, to examine multivariate interactions at a single time point, canonical correlation, which finds the linear combinations of signals that maximize the correlation, may be used. We report here a new method that produces interpretations much like these standard techniques and, in addition, 1) extends the idea of canonical correlation to 3-way arrays (with dimensionality number of signals by number of time points by number of trials), 2) allows for nonstationarity, 3) also allows for nonlinearity, 4) scales well as the number of signals increases, and 5) captures predictive relationships, as is done with Granger causality.

Methods of estimating high-dimensional covariation based on \u2113 1-regularization are most appropriate when there are a small number of relatively large partial correlations, but in neural data there are often large numbers of relatively small partial correlations. Furthermore, the variation across trials is often confounded by Poisson-like variation within trials. To overcome these problems we introduce a comprehensive methodology that imbeds a Gaussian graphical model into a hierarchical structure: the counts are assumed Poisson, conditionally on latent variables that follow a Gaussian graphical model, and the graphical model parameters, in turn, are assumed to depend on physiologically-motivated covariates, which can greatly improve correct detection of interactions (non-zero partial correlations).

In order to organize behavior and allocate effort so that optimal behavioral policies can be selected, it is necessary to continually monitor ongoing actions. Real-time processing of information related to actions and outcomes is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, but also depends on midbrain regions, especially the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We were interested in how individual VTA neurons, as well as networks within the VTA, encode salient events when an unpredictable number of serial actions are required to obtain a reward. We recorded from ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA as animals performed multiple cued trials in a recording session where, in each trial, serial actions were randomly rewarded. While averaging population activity did not reveal a response pattern, we observed that different neurons were selectively tuned to low, medium, or high numbered actions in a trial. This preferential tuning of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons to different subsets of actions in a trial allowed information about binned action number to be decoded from the ensemble activity. At the network level, tuning curve similarity was positively associated with action-evoked noise correlations, suggesting that action number selectivity reflects functional connectivity within these networks. Analysis of phasic responses to cue and reward revealed that the requirement to execute multiple and uncertain numbers of actions weakens both cue-evoked responses and cue-reward response correlation. The functional connectivity and ensemble coding scheme that we observe here may allow VTA neurons to cooperatively provide a real-time account of ongoing behavior.

In magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, sensors across subjects are poorly correlated both because of differences in the exact location of the sensors, and structural and functional differences in the brains. It is possible to achieve alignment by assuming that the same regions of different brains correspond across subjects. However, this relies on both the assumption that brain anatomy and function are well correlated, and the strong assumptions that go into solving the under-determined inverse problem given the high-dimensional source space. In this article, we investigated an alternative method that bypasses source-localization. Instead, it analyzes the sensor recordings themselves and aligns their temporal signatures across subjects. We used a multivariate approach, multiset canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA), to transform individual subject data to a low-dimensional common representational space. We evaluated the robustness of this approach over a synthetic dataset, by examining the effect of different factors that add to the noise and individual differences in the data. On an MEG dataset, we demonstrated that M-CCA performs better than a method that assumes perfect sensor correspondence and a method that applies source localization. Last, we described how the standard M-CCA algorithm could be further improved with a regularization term that incorporates spatial sensor information.

A regression analysis of neural responses in face-sensitive regions against behavioral learning curves revealed significant correlations with learning in the majority of the face-sensitive regions in the face network, mostly between 150-250 ms, but also after 300 ms. However, the effect was smaller in nonventral regions (within the superior temporal areas and prefrontal cortex) than that in the ventral regions (within the inferior occipital gyri (IOG), midfusiform gyri (mFUS) and anterior temporal lobes). A multivariate discriminant analysis also revealed that IOG and mFUS, which showed strong correlation effects with learning, exhibited significant discriminability between the two face categories at different time points both between 150-250 ms and after 300 ms. In contrast, the nonventral face-sensitive regions, where correlation effects with learning were smaller, did exhibit some significant discriminability, but mainly after 300 ms.

When measured for a pair of neurons over multiple repetitions of an identical stimulus, this phenomenon emerges as correlated trial-to-trial response variability via spike count correlation (SCC). However, spike counts can be viewed as noisy versions of firing rates, which can vary from trial to trial. From this perspective, the SCC for a pair of neurons becomes a noisy version of the corresponding firing rate correlation (FRC). Furthermore, the magnitude of the SCC is generally smaller than that of the FRC and is likely to be less sensitive to experimental manipulation.

But this may be inappropriate for many of today's large-scale screening problems, where auxiliary information about each test is often available, and where a combined analysis can lead to poorly calibrated error rates within different subsets of the experiment. To address this issue, we introduce an approach called false-discovery-rate regression that directly uses this auxiliary information to inform the outcome of each test. The method can be motivated by a two-groups model in which covariates are allowed to influence the local false discovery rate, or equivalently, the posterior probability that a given observation is a signal. This poses many subtle issues at the interface between inference and computation, and we investigate several variations of the overall approach. Simulation evidence suggests that: (1) when covariate effects are present, FDR regression improves power for a fixed false-discovery rate; and (2) when covariate effects are absent, the method is robust, in the sense that it does not lead to inflated error rates. We apply the method to neural recordings from primary visual cortex. The goal is to detect pairs of neurons that exhibit fine-time-scale interactions, in the sense that they fire together more often than expected due to chance.

This spike synchrony may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons' fluctuating firing patterns, or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way, spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. A point process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron's firing-rate functions. An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations, which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. To establish the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression framework. We first extended a previously-published model of spike-field association and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and 3) in vivo recordings of neocortical V4 neurons.

Understanding how disruption in cardiac Na(+)-based processes leads to derangement in multiple cardiac components at the level of the cell and to then connect these perturbations to emergent behaviour in the heart to cause disease is a critical area of research.

Mounting evidence has implicated the Purkinje fiber network in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that long QT mutations can demonstrate different phenotypes depending on the tissue type of expression. Using computational models of the human ventricular myocyte and the Purkinje fiber cell, the biophysical alteration in channel function in LQT1, LQT2, LQT3, and LQT7 are modeled. We identified that the plateau potential was important in LQT1 and LQT2, in which mutation led to minimal action potential prolongation in Purkinje fiber cells. The phenotype of LQT3 mutation was dependent on the biophysical alteration induced as well as tissue type. The canonical \u0394KPQ mutation causes severe action potential prolongation in both tissue types. For LQT3 mutation F1473C, characterized by shifted channel availability, a more severe phenotype was seen in Purkinje fiber cells with action potential prolongation and early afterdepolarizations. The LQT3 mutation S1904L demonstrated striking effects on action potential duration restitution and more severe action potential prolongation in Purkinje fiber cells at higher heart rates.

Mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE subunits can cause congenital channelopathies, such as deafness, cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. The mechanism by which KCNE1-\u03b2 subunits slow the kinetics of KCNQ1 channels is a matter of current controversy. Here we show that KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel activation occurs in two steps: first, mutually independent voltage sensor movements in the four KCNQ1 subunits generate the main gating charge movement and underlie the initial delay in the activation time course of KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents. Second, a slower and concerted conformational change of all four voltage sensors and the gate, which opens the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. Our data show that KCNE1 divides the voltage sensor movement into two steps with widely different voltage dependences and kinetics. The two voltage sensor steps in KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels can be pharmacologically isolated and further separated by a disease-causing mutation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fluorescence", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "KCNQ1 Potassium Channel", "Kinetics", "Models, Biological", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Subunits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Barro-Soria", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Santiago", "Last Name": "Rebolledo", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara I", "Last Name": "Liin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marta E", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Peter", "Last Name": "Larsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2014Apr28"}, {"PMID": "24283236", "Title": "A novel channelopathy in pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Channelopathies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Male", "Mutation, Missense", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin S", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "PubDate": "2013Nov28"}, {"PMID": "24199760", "Title": "Three hundred robotic-assisted mitral valve repairs: the Cedars-Sinai experience.", "Abstract": "The study objective was to review our first 300 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral repairs performed from June 2005 to October 2012 and to compare the surgical outcomes of our previously reported initial 120 cases with the subsequent 180 procedures.", "Keywords": ["28", "35", "MR", "MV", "TEE", "mitral regurgitation", "mitral valve", "transesophageal echocardiography"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation", "Clinical Competence", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Learning Curve", "Los Angeles", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitral Valve", "Mitral Valve Annuloplasty", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Postoperative Complications", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Robotics", "Severity of Illness Index", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danny", "Last Name": "Ramzy", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, Calif.

To better understand the cortical basis of this categorization process, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neural activity while participants learned-with feedback-to discriminate two highly-similar, novel visual categories. We hypothesized that although prefrontal regions would mediate early category learning, this role would diminish with increasing category familiarity and that regions within the ventral visual pathway would come to play a more prominent role in encoding category-relevant information as learning progressed. Early in learning we observed some degree of categorical discriminability and predictability in both prefrontal cortex and the ventral visual pathway. Predictability improved significantly above chance in the ventral visual pathway over the course of learning with the left inferior temporal and fusiform gyri showing the greatest improvement in predictability between 150 and 250 ms (M200) during category learning. In contrast, there was no comparable increase in discriminability in prefrontal cortex with the only significant post-learning effect being a decrease in predictability in the inferior frontal gyrus between 250 and 350 ms (M300).

Differential coassembly with single transmembrane KCNE beta subunits in different cell types gives rise to a variety of biophysical properties, hence endowing distinct physiological roles for KCNQ1-KCNEx complexes. Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes result in diseases in brain, heart, and the respiratory system. In addition to complexities arising from existence of five KCNE subunits, KCNE1 to KCNE5, recent studies in heterologous systems suggest unorthodox stoichiometric dynamics in subunit assembly is dependent on KCNE expression levels. The resultant KCNQ1-KCNE channel complexes may have a range of zero to two or even up to four KCNE subunits coassembling per KCNQ1 tetramer. These findings underscore the need to assess the selectivity of small-molecule KCNQ1 modulators on these different assemblies. Here we report a unique small-molecule gating modulator, ML277, that potentiates both homomultimeric KCNQ1 channels and unsaturated heteromultimeric (KCNQ1)4(KCNE1)n (n < 4) channels. Progressive increase of KCNE1 or KCNE3 expression reduces efficacy of ML277 and eventually abolishes ML277-mediated augmentation. In cardiomyocytes, the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, or IKs, is believed to be a heteromultimeric combination of KCNQ1 and KCNE1, but it is not entirely clear whether IKs is mediated by KCNE-saturated KCNQ1 channels or by channels with intermediate stoichiometries. We found ML277 effectively augments IKs current of cultured human cardiomyocytes and shortens action potential duration. These data indicate that unsaturated heteromultimeric (KCNQ1)4(KCNE1)n channels are present as components of IKs and are pharmacologically distinct from KCNE-saturated KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels.", "Keywords": ["cardiac physiology", "drug", "long QT", "pharmacology"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ion Transport", "KCNQ1 Potassium Channel", "Muscle Proteins", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Piperidines", "Potassium", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated", "Protein Multimerization", "Thiazoles", "Tosyl Compounds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haibo", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "The Solomon H Snyder Department of Neuroscience, High Throughput Biology Center and Johns Hopkins Ion Channel Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhihong", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Margrith E", "Last Name": "Mattmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beiyan", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cecile", "Last Name": "Terrenoire", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongkang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Owen B", "Last Name": "McManus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Craig W", "Last Name": "Lindsley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Corey R", "Last Name": "Hopkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013May21"}, {"PMID": "23623800", "Title": "Reply to the editor - Inside-out insulation failure of a defibrillator lead with abrasion-resistant coating.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charles D", "Last Name": "Swerdlow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert M", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Khoynezhad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Heart rhythm", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23566648", "Title": "Survival and quality of life for nonagenarians after cardiac surgery.", "Abstract": "Reports of cardiac surgery in the elderly have focused primarily on septuagenarians and octogenarians.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the pharmacology of disease processes in therapeutically and genetically relevant primary cell types in vitro and to interweave clinical and basic molecular data. We report here the derivation of iPSCs from a long QT syndrome patient with complex genetics. The proband was found to have a de novo SCN5A LQT-3 mutation (F1473C) and a polymorphism (K897T) in KCNH2, the gene for LQT-2. Analysis of the biophysics and molecular pharmacology of ion channels expressed in cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from these iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) demonstrates a primary LQT-3 (Na(+) channel) defect responsible for the arrhythmias not influenced by the KCNH2 polymorphism. The F1473C mutation occurs in the channel inactivation gate and enhances late Na(+) channel current (I(NaL)) that is carried by channels that fail to inactivate completely and conduct increased inward current during prolonged depolarization, resulting in delayed repolarization, a prolonged QT interval, and increased risk of fatal arrhythmia. We find a very pronounced rate dependence of I(NaL) such that increasing the pacing rate markedly reduces I(NaL) and, in addition, increases its inhibition by the Na(+) channel blocker mexiletine. These rate-dependent properties and drug interactions, unique to the proband's iPSC-CMs, correlate with improved management of arrhythmias in the patient and provide support for this approach in developing patient-specific clinical regimens.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Biophysical Phenomena", "Cell Communication", "Cells, Cultured", "ERG1 Potassium Channel", "Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels", "Flecainide", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Long QT Syndrome", "Male", "Mexiletine", "Mutation", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Pharmacogenetics", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Sodium Channels", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cecile", "Last Name": "Terrenoire", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelvin W Chan", "Last Name": "Tung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Pass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan T", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jyh-Chang", "Last Name": "Jean", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amel", "Last Name": "Omari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darrell N", "Last Name": "Kotton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Keller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Kass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23147009", "Title": "Trial time warping to discriminate stimulus-related from movement-related neural activity.", "Abstract": "In tasks where different sensory, cognitive, and motor events are mixed in a sequence it is difficult to determine whether neural activity is related to any behavioral parameter.

To discover whether neural responses are better aligned to sensory or motor events we introduce a family of trial-alignment time-warping functions indexed by a single parameter such that when the parameter takes the value 0 the trials are aligned to the stimulus and when the parameter takes the value 1 they are aligned to the movement. We then characterize neurons by the best-fitting alignment scheme (in the sense of maximum likelihood) under the assumption that the correct alignment would produce homogeneous trials without excess trial-to-trial variation. We use Bayes factors to determine the evidence in favor of sensory or motor neural alignments. The simulations revealed that the variability in neural responses and sequential motor outputs are key parameters to obtain appropriate warping results.
