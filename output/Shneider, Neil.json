Here, we investigated whether ALS-relevant signatures can be detected directly from biopsied patient fibroblasts. We profiled familial ALS (fALS) fibroblasts, representing a range of mutations in the fused in sarcoma (FUS) gene and ages of onset. To differentiate FUS fALS and healthy control fibroblasts, machine-learning classifiers were trained separately on high-content imaging and transcriptional profiles. \"Molecular ALS phenotype\" scores, derived from these classifiers, captured a spectrum from disease to health. Interestingly, these scores negatively correlated with age of onset, identified several pre-symptomatic individuals and sporadic ALS (sALS) patients with FUS-like fibroblasts, and quantified \"movement\" of FUS fALS and \"FUS-like\" sALS toward health upon FUS ASO treatment. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that non-neuronal patient fibroblasts can be used for rapid, personalized assessment in ALS.", "Keywords": ["ASO", "FUS", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "antisense oligonucleutide", "cell models", "fibroblasts", "fused in sarcoma", "high-content imaging", "machine learning", "transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karl", "Last Name": "Kumbier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maike", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zizheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Lazzari-Dean", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Waters", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Hammerlindl", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Capria", "Last Name": "Rinaldi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vladislav A", "Last Name": "Korobeynikov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Project ALS Therapeutics Core, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "New York Genome Center ALS ConsortiumCenter for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease, New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease, New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hemali", "Last Name": "Phatnani", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease, New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Shneider", "Affiliation": "Project ALS Therapeutics Core, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Neurology, Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lani F", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

The Miami Framework, emerging from discussions at the Second International Pre-Symptomatic ALS Workshop in Miami (February 2023; a full list of attendees and their affiliations appears in the Supplementary Information) proposes a classification system built on: first, three parallel phenotypic axes - motor neuron, frontotemporal and extrapyramidal - rather than the unitary approach of combining all phenotypic elements into a single clinical entity; and second, biomarkers that reflect different aspects of the underlying pathology and biology of neurodegeneration.

Stasimon/Tmem41b has also been linked to the function of sensory-motor circuits and the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. However, the early embryonic lethality of constitutive knockout in mice has hindered the analysis of spatial and temporal requirements of Stasimon/Tmem41b in vivo. To address this, we developed a novel mouse line harboring a conditional knockout allele of the Stasimon/Tmem41b gene in which exon 4 has been flanked by loxP sites (Stas/Tmem41bCKO). Cre-mediated recombination of Stas/Tmem41bCKO generates a functionally null allele (Stas/Tmem41b\u03944) resulting in loss of protein expression and embryonic lethality in the homozygous mouse mutant. Here, using a ubiquitously expressed, tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase in the homozygous Stas/Tmem41bCKO mice, we demonstrate that postnatal depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b rapidly arrests weight gain in adult mice and causes motor dysfunction and death approximately three weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, we show that depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b severely affects cell proliferation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

However, the analysis of deeply phenotyped human post-mortem samples has shown that TDP-43 aggregation, revealed by standard antibody methods, correlates poorly with symptom manifestation. Recent identification of cryptic-splicing events, such as the detection of Stathmin-2 (STMN-2) cryptic exons, are providing evidence implicating TDP-43 loss-of-function as a potential driving pathomechanism but the temporal nature of TDP-43 loss and its relation to the disease process and clinical phenotype is not known. To address these outstanding questions, we used a novel RNA aptamer, TDP-43APT, to detect TDP-43 pathology and used single molecule in situ hybridization to sensitively reveal TDP-43 loss-of-function and applied these in a deeply phenotyped human post-mortem tissue cohort. We demonstrate that TDP-43APT identifies pathological TDP-43, detecting aggregation events that cannot be detected by classical antibody stains. We show that nuclear TDP-43 pathology is an early event, occurring prior to cytoplasmic accumulation and is associated with loss-of-function measured by coincident STMN-2 cryptic splicing pathology. Crucially, we show that these pathological features of TDP-43 loss-of-function precede the clinical inflection point and are not required for region specific clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gain-of-function in the form of extensive cytoplasmic accumulation, but not loss-of-function, is the primary molecular correlate of clinical manifestation.

The PLS Natural History Study is a 30-site, 24-month, prospective study that is supported by multiple funding sources. The study aims to enroll 50 early PLS (disease duration \u22644 years) and 50 definite PLS (disease duration 4 to 15 years) participants using modified PLS Diagnostic Criteria. Smartphone-based assessments including semi-quantitative and quantitative measures and patient-reported outcomes are utilized. In-person quantitative measures are also completed during site visits. The change in the PLS Functional Rating Scale score is the primary outcome. The study utilizes the NeuroBANK\u00ae patient-centric data capture and management platform. The biostatistical analysis plan has been developed. Results. In one year, 28 participants have been recruited. Enrollment has been much slower than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rarity of PLS, and potential study competition for internal resources from ALS clinical trials. Discussion. We discuss the need for more innovative methods to enroll and study individuals with such rare diseases and propose a number of mechanisms by which more efficient enrollment could be facilitated.",

affects motor neurons and voluntary muscle control1. ALS heterogeneity includes the age of manifestation, the rate of progression and the anatomical sites of symptom onset. Disease-causing mutations in specific genes have been identified and define different subtypes of ALS1. Although several ALS-associated genes have been shown to affect immune functions2, whether specific immune features account for ALS heterogeneity is poorly understood. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-4 (ALS4) is characterized by juvenile onset and slow progression3. Patients with ALS4 show motor difficulties by the time that they are in their thirties, and most of them require devices to assist with walking by their fifties. ALS4 is caused by mutations in the senataxin gene (SETX). Here, using Setx knock-in mice that carry the ALS4-causative L389S mutation, we describe an immunological signature that consists of clonally expanded, terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) CD8\u2009T cells in the central nervous system and the blood of knock-in mice. Increased frequencies of antigen-specific CD8\u2009T cells in knock-in mice mirror the progression of motor neuron disease and correlate with anti-glioma immunity. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation experiments indicate that the immune system has a key role in ALS4 neurodegeneration. In patients with ALS4, clonally expanded TEMRA CD8\u2009T cells circulate in the peripheral blood. Our results provide evidence of an antigen-specific CD8\u2009T cell response in ALS4, which could be used to unravel disease mechanisms and as a potential biomarker of disease state.", "Keywords": [],

Recent evidence has shown that FUS toxic gain of function due either to mutations or to increased expression can disrupt critical cellular processes, including mitochondrial functions. Here, we demonstrate that in human cells overexpressing wild-type FUS or expressing mutant derivatives, the protein associates with multiple mRNAs, and these are enriched in mRNAs encoding mitochondrial respiratory chain components. Notably, this sequestration leads to reduced levels of the encoded proteins, which is sufficient to bring about disorganized mitochondrial networks, reduced aerobic respiration and increased reactive oxygen species. We further show that mutant FUS associates with mitochondria and with mRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome.

Supporting this view, investigations in both in vitro and in vivo models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors Ripk1, Ripk3, and Mlkl in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1G93A mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of Ripk3 in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1G93A astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of Ripk3 in Tg SOD1G93A mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of Ripk3 silencing in vivo. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1G93A or Optineurin knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model.

FUS is a multifunctional protein involved in the biogenesis and activity of several types of RNAs, and its role in the pathogenesis of ALS may involve both direct effects of disease-associated mutations through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms and indirect effects due to the cross talk between different classes of FUS-dependent RNAs. To explore how FUS mutations impinge on motor neuron-specific RNA-based circuitries, we performed transcriptome profiling of small and long RNAs of motor neurons (MNs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a FUS-P517L knock-in mutation, which is equivalent to human FUS-P525L, associated with a severe and juvenile-onset form of ALS. Combining ontological, predictive and molecular analyses, we found an inverse correlation between several classes of deregulated miRNAs and their corresponding mRNA targets in both homozygous and heterozygous P517L MNs. We validated a circuitry in which the upregulation of miR-409-3p and miR-495-3p, belonging to a brain-specific miRNA subcluster implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, produced the downregulation of Gria2, a subunit of the glutamate \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)\u00a0receptor with a significant role in excitatory neurotransmission. Moreover, we found that FUS was involved in mediating such miRNA repression.

We then show that G-Q RNA foci are more abundant in C9 ALS patient fibroblasts and astrocytes compared to those without the expansion, and more frequently colocalize with hnRNP H. Importantly, we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of multiple known hnRNP H-target transcripts in C9 patient brains, which correlates with elevated insoluble hnRNP H/G-Q aggregates.

Interneuron activity is in turn modulated by the organization of their synaptic inputs, but the principles governing the development of specific synaptic architectures unique to each premotor interneuron are unknown. For example, Renshaw cells receive, at least in the neonate, convergent inputs from sensory afferents (likely Ia) and motor axons, raising the question of whether they interact during Renshaw cell development. In other well-studied neurons, such as Purkinje cells, heterosynaptic competition between inputs from different sources shapes synaptic organization. To examine the possibility that sensory afferents modulate synaptic maturation on developing Renshaw cells, we used three animal models in which afferent inputs in the ventral horn are dramatically reduced (ER81(-/-) knockout), weakened (Egr3(-/-) knockout), or strengthened (mlcNT3(+/-) transgenic). We demonstrate that increasing the strength of sensory inputs on Renshaw cells prevents their deselection and reduces motor axon synaptic density, and, in contrast, absent or diminished sensory afferent inputs correlate with increased densities of motor axons synapses. No effects were observed on other glutamatergic inputs.

We report the results of a moderate-scale sequencing study aimed at increasing the number of genes known to contribute to predisposition for ALS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 2869 ALS patients and 6405 controls. Several known ALS genes were found to be associated, and TBK1 (the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) was identified as an ALS gene. TBK1 is known to bind to and phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in innate immunity and autophagy, including optineurin (OPTN) and p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome), both of which have also been implicated in ALS. These observations reveal a key role of the autophagic pathway in ALS and suggest specific targets for therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal

Factors that anticipated their neurotoxicity included aggregation in nucleoli, decreased number of processing bodies, and stress granule formation, implying global translational dysregulation as path accountable for toxicity. Nuclear PR aggregates were also found in human induced motor neurons and postmortem spinal cord tissues from C9ORF72 ALS and ALS/FTD patients.
