Yet the effects of different BP control strategies across the life course on AD/ADRD are unknown. Randomized trials may be infeasible due to prolonged follow-up and large sample sizes. Simulation analysis is a practical approach to estimating these effects using the best available existing data. However, existing simulation frameworks cannot estimate the effects of BP control on both dementia and cardiovascular disease. This manuscript describes the design principles, implementation details, and population-level validation of a novel population-health microsimulation framework, the MIchigan ChROnic Disease SIMulation (MICROSIM), for The Effect of Lower Blood Pressure over the Life Course on Late-life Cognition in Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites (BP-COG) study of the effect of BP levels over the life course on dementia and cardiovascular disease. MICROSIM is an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation designed using computer programming best practices. MICROSIM estimates annual vascular risk factor levels and transition probabilities in all-cause dementia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality in a nationally representative sample of US adults 18+ using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). MICROSIM models changes in risk factors over time, cognition and dementia using changes from a pooled dataset of individual participant data from 6 US prospective cardiovascular cohort studies. Cardiovascular risks were estimated using a widely used risk model and BP treatment effects were derived from meta-analyses of randomized trials. MICROSIM is an extensible, open-source framework designed to estimate the population-level impact of different BP management strategies and reproduces US population-level estimates of BP and other vascular risk factors levels, their change over time, and incident all-cause dementia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Michigan", "Chronic

There is little data on stroke disparities among patients with HF or the factors responsible. We hypothesized disparities in stroke prevalence exist among patients with HF in a manner not fully explained by burden of cardiovascular disease. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014). Cardiovascular profiles were compared by race/ethnicity. Using survey-weighted models, effect modification of the relationship between HF and stroke by race/ethnicity was examined adjusting for cardiovascular profiles. Of 40,437 participants, 2.5\u00a0% had HF. The HF cohort had a greater proportion of White and Black participants (77\u00a0% vs 74\u00a0% and 15\u00a0% vs 12\u00a0%, respectively) and fewer participants of Hispanic ethnicity (8\u00a0% vs 14\u00a0%).

The history of these medications dates to the discovery of the first fibrinolytic compound, streptokinase, from bacterial cultures in 1933. Over time, researchers identified two other plasminogen activators in human samples, namely urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Subsequently, tPA was cloned using recombinant DNA methods to produce alteplase. Several additional derivatives of tPA, such as tenecteplase and reteplase, were developed to extend the plasma half-life of tPA. Over the past decades, fibrinolytic medications have been widely used to manage patients with venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Currently, alteplase is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute ischemic stroke, and central venous access device occlusion. Reteplase and tenecteplase have also received FDA approval for treating patients with STEMI.

Science: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "In 1924, the founders of the American Heart Association (AHA) envisioned an international society focused on the heart and aimed at facilitating research, disseminating information, increasing public awareness, and developing public health policy related to heart disease. This presidential advisory provides a comprehensive review of the past century of cardiovascular and stroke science, with a focus on the AHA's contributions, as well as informed speculation about the future of cardiovascular science into the next century of the organization's history. The AHA is a leader in fundamental, translational, clinical, and population science, and it promotes the concept of the \"learning health system,\" in which a continuous cycle of evidence-based practice leads to practice-based evidence, permitting an iterative refinement in clinical evidence and care. This advisory presents the AHA's journey over the past century from instituting professional membership to establishing extraordinary research funding programs; translating evidence to practice through clinical practice guidelines; affecting systems of care through quality programs, certification, and implementation; leading important advocacy efforts at the federal, state and local levels; and building global coalitions around cardiovascular and stroke science and public health. Recognizing an exciting potential future for science and medicine, the advisory offers a vision for even greater impact for the AHA's second century in its continued mission to be a relentless force for longer, healthier lives.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "cardiovascular diseases", "public health", "research", "science", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["United States", "Humans",

However, randomized controlled trials suggest that DOACs may not be as efficacious or as safe as the current standard of care in conditions such as mechanical heart valves, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic heart disease. DOACs do not provide a net benefit in conditions such as embolic stroke of undetermined source. Their efficacy is uncertain for conditions such as left ventricular thrombus, catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and for patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thrombosis who have end-stage renal disease. This paper provides an evidence-based review of randomized controlled trials on DOACs, detailing when they have demonstrated efficacy and safety, when DOACs should not be the standard of care, where their safety and efficacy are uncertain, and areas requiring further research.", "Keywords": ["arterial thrombosis", "bleeding", "direct oral anticoagulants", "randomized controlled trial", "standard of care", "venous thromboembolism"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Administration, Oral", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Thrombosis", "Venous Thromboembolism", "Venous Thrombosis", "Vitamin K", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Antoine", "Last Name": "Bejjani", "Affiliation": "Thrombosis Research Group, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA;

Epidemiological data demonstrate higher absolute risk of both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and heart failure as an individual progresses from CKM stage 0 to stage 3, but optimal strategies for risk assessment need to be refined. Absolute risk assessment with the goal to match type and intensity of interventions with predicted risk and expected treatment benefit remains the cornerstone of primary prevention. Given the growing number of therapies in our armamentarium that simultaneously address all 3 CKM axes, novel risk prediction equations are needed that incorporate predictors and outcomes relevant to the CKM context. This should also include social determinants of health, which are key upstream drivers of CVD, to more equitably estimate and address risk. This scientific statement summarizes the background, rationale, and clinical implications for the newly developed sex-specific, race-free risk equations: PREVENT (AHA Predicting Risk of CVD Events). The PREVENT equations enable 10- and 30-year risk estimates for total CVD (composite of atherosclerotic CVD and heart failure), include estimated glomerular filtration rate as a predictor, and adjust for competing risk of non-CVD death among adults 30 to 79 years of age. Additional models accommodate enhanced predictive utility with the addition of CKM factors when clinically indicated for measurement (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and hemoglobin A1c) or social determinants of health (social deprivation index) when available.

Methods We performed a longitudinal analysis in the population-based prospective Cardiovascular Health Study. Medicare-eligible participants aged >65 years with and without incident stroke had cognition assessed annually. HAIs were assessed by hospital discharge codes. Global cognitive function was assessed annually by Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and executive function by Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). We used linear mixed models to estimate the mean decline and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for 3MSE and DSST scores by incident stroke and HAI status, adjusted for demographics and vascular risk factors. Results Among 5,443 participants >65 years without previous history of stroke, 393 participants had stroke with HAI (SI), 766 had a stroke only (SO), and 4,284 had no stroke (NS) throughout a maximum 9-year follow-up. For 3MSE, compared with NS participants, SO participants had a similar adjusted mean decline (additional 0.08 points/year, 95%CI -0.15, 0.31), while SI participants had a more rapid decline (additional 0.28 points/year, 95%CI 0.16, 0.40).

This scientific statement uses a crosswalk of major guidelines, in addition to a review of the scientific literature, to summarize the evidence and fundamental gaps related to the science, screening, prevention, and management of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "cardiovascular diseases", "diabetes, type 2", "heart diseases", "kidney failure, chronic", "metabolic syndrome", "obesity", "social determinants of health"], "MeSH terms": ["United States", "Humans", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Metabolic Syndrome", "American Heart Association", "Risk Factors", "Kidney", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chiadi E", "Last Name": "Ndumele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian J", "Last Name": "Neeland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine R", "Last Name": "Tuttle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sheryl L", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roy O", "Last Name": "Mathew", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sadiya S", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Josef", "Last Name": "Coresh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carissa M", "Last Name": "Baker-Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mercedes R", "Last Name": "Carnethon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Pierre", "Last Name": "Despr\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer E", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Joseph", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Walter N", "Last Name": "Kernan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amit", "Last Name": "Khera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mikhail N", "Last Name": "Kosiborod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carolyn L", "Last Name": "Lekavich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eldrin F", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin B", "Last Name": "Lo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bige", "Last Name": "Ozkan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Latha P", "Last Name": "Palaniappan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sonali S", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Pencina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiffany M", "Last Name": "Powell-Wiley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurence S", "Last Name": "Sperling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Salim S", "Last Name": "Virani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jackson T", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Radhika", "Last Name": "Rajgopal Singh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janani", "Last Name": "Rangaswami", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Heart Association", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation", "PubDate": "2023Nov14"}, {"PMID": "37798224", "Title": "Life-Course Brain Health as a Determinant of Late-Life Mental Health: American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry Expert Panel Recommendations.", "Abstract": "This position statement of the Expert Panel on Brain Health of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) emphasizes the critical role of life course brain health in shaping mental well-being during the later stages of life. Evidence posits that maintaining optimal brain health earlier in life is crucial for preventing and managing brain aging-related disorders such as dementia/cognitive decline, depression, stroke, and anxiety. We advocate for a holistic approach that integrates medical, psychological, and social frameworks with culturally tailored interventions across the lifespan to promote brain health and overall mental well-being in aging adults across all communities. Furthermore, our statement underscores the significance of prevention, early detection, and intervention in identifying cognitive decline, mood changes, and related mental illness. Action should also be taken to understand and address the needs of communities that traditionally have unequal access to preventive health information and services. By implementing culturally relevant and tailored evidence-based practices and advancing research in geriatric psychiatry, behavioral neurology, and geroscience, we can enhance the quality of life for older adults facing the unique challenges of aging. This position statement emphasizes the intrinsic link between brain health and mental health in aging, urging healthcare professionals, policymakers, and a broader society to prioritize comprehensive strategies that safeguard and promote brain health from birth through later years across all communities.

Although there is a relatively clear sense of what constitutes a healthy diet, most of the US population does not eat healthy food at rates consistent with the recommended clinical guidelines. An abundance of barriers, including food and nutrition insecurity, how food is marketed and advertised, access to and affordability of healthy foods, and behavioral challenges such as a focus on immediate versus delayed gratification, stand in the way of healthier dietary patterns for many Americans. Food Is Medicine may be defined as the provision of healthy food resources to prevent, manage, or treat specific clinical conditions in coordination with the health care sector. Although the field has promise, relatively few studies have been conducted with designs that provide strong evidence of associations between Food Is Medicine interventions and health outcomes or health costs. Much work needs to be done to create a stronger body of evidence that convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of Food Is Medicine interventions. An estimated 90% of the $4.3 trillion annual cost of health care in the United States is spent on medical care for chronic disease. For many of these diseases, diet is a major risk factor, so even modest improvements in diet could have a significant impact. This presidential advisory offers an overview of the state of the field of Food Is Medicine and a road map for a new research initiative that strategically approaches the outstanding questions in the field while prioritizing a human-centered design approach to achieve high rates of patient engagement and sustained behavior change. This will ideally happen in the context of broader efforts to use a health equity-centered approach to enhance the ways in which our food system and related policies support improvements in health.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "chronic disease", "diet, healthy", "food", "food supply", "health care costs", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "United States", "American Heart Association", "Diet", "Nutritional Status", "Risk Factors", "Health Care Costs"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kevin G", "Last Name": "Volpp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seth A", "Last Name": "Berkowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shreela V", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cheryl A M", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "LaPrincess C", "Last Name": "Brewer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher D", "Last Name": "Gardner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie E", "Last Name": "Gervis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Herrero", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alice H", "Last Name": "Lichtenstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "McClellan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jen", "Last Name": "Muse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christina A", "Last Name": "Roberto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Justin P V", "Last Name": "Zachariah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Heart Association", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation", "PubDate": "2023Oct31"}, {"PMID": "37757472", "Title": "Cancer and the risk of perioperative arterial ischaemic events.", "Abstract": "Most cancer patients require surgery for diagnosis and treatment.

LA\u03b5 and LASR were assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 824 participants from the community-based Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study. Positive longitudinal LA\u03b5 and LASR during ventricular systole, LASR during early ventricular diastole, and LASR during LA contraction were measured. Cause-specific hazards regression model\u00a0evaluated the association of LA\u03b5 and LASR with incident AF, adjusting for pertinent covariates. The mean age was 71.1 \u00b1 9.2 years (313 men, 511 women). During a mean follow-up of 10.9\u00a0years, new-onset AF occurred in 105 participants (12.7%). Lower LA\u03b5 and LASR at baseline were observed in patients with new-onset AF (all p <0.01). In multivariable analysis, positive longitudinal LA\u03b5 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per SD decrease 2.05, confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 3.36) and LASR during LA contraction (HR per SD increase 2.24, CI 1.37 to 3.65) remained associated with new-onset AF, independently of LA volumes and left ventricular function. Along with positive longitudinal LA\u03b5, reduced LASR during ventricular systole predicted AF in participants with LA volume below the median value (HR 2.54, CI 1.10 to 6.09), whereas reduced LASR during LA contraction predicted AF in participants with larger LA (HR 2.35, CI 1.31 to 4.23). In conclusion, reduced positive longitudinal LA\u03b5 and LASR predict new-onset AF in older adults regardless of LA size and may improve AF risk stratification.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "atrial myopathy", "cardiovascular prevention", "elderly", "left atrial strain", "speckle-tracking echocardiography"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Female", "Aged", "Middle Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Heart Atria", "Echocardiography", "Atrial Appendage", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Mannina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kazato", "Last Name": "Ito", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zhezhen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuriko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cesare", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Koki", "Last Name": "Nakanishi", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, New York, New York; Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Evelyn F.

The relationship between subclinical LV dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias in the general population is not established. Methods and Results Participants in the SAFARIS (Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation and Risk of Ischemic Stroke) study with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (n=503; mean age 77\u2009years, 63% women) underwent 14-day electrocardiographic monitoring and 2-dimensional echocardiography. Frequent PVCs were defined as PVCs >500 per 24\u2009hours and NSVT as \u22654 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats. Reduced LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was used as an indicator of subclinical LV dysfunction. Seventy-six participants (15.1%) had PVCs >500/d, 117 (23.3%) had NSVT episodes. LV GLS was significantly reduced in both frequent PVCs and NSVT groups (P<0.01). In multivariable analyses, lower LV GLS was associated with frequent PVCs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.09-1.30 per unit reduction]; P<0.001) and NSVT (aOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01-1.17]; P=0.036) independently of established risk factors and other echocardiographic parameters. Abnormal LV GLS (>-15.8%) carried a 2-fold increase in risk of ventricular arrhythmias (aOR, 2.18, P=0.029 for PVCs; aOR, 2.09, P=0.026 for NSVT).

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of executive function are sparse, particularly in populations underrepresented in medical research. We performed a GWAS on a composite measure of executive function that included measures of mental flexibility and reasoning using data from the Northern Manhattan Study, a racially and ethnically diverse cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a01077, 69% Hispanic, 17% non-Hispanic Black and 14% non-Hispanic White). Four SNPs located in the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1362 gene, LINC01362, on chromosome 1p31.1, were significantly associated with the composite measure of executive function in this cohort (top SNP rs2788328, \u00df\u00a0=\u00a00.22, p\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10). The associated SNPs have been shown to influence expression of the tubulin tyrosine ligase like 7 gene, TTLL7 and the protein kinase CAMP-activated catalytic subunit beta gene, PRKACB, in several regions of the brain involved in executive function.

We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals",

Yet the brain is susceptible to several vascular disorders that either are not found in other parts of the body or when found are much less likely to cause clinical syndromes in other organs. This specific vulnerability of the brain may be explained by structural and functional differences between the vessels of the brain and those of vessels in other parts of the body. In this review, we focus on how cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology may make the brain and its vessels more susceptible to unique vascular pathologies. To highlight these differences, we use our knowledge of five diseases and syndromes that most commonly manifest in the intracranial vasculature. For each, we identify characteristics of the intracranial arteries that make them susceptible to these diseases, while noting areas of uncertainty requiring further research.", "Keywords": ["Brain", "Cerebral arteries", "Ischemic stroke", "Pathology", "Vascular disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain", "Cerebral Arteries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Setareh", "Last Name": "Salehi Omran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay P", "Last Name": "Mohr", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "35652416", "Title": "Ischemic stroke with cancer: Hematologic and embolic biomarkers and clinical outcomes.", "Abstract": "Patients with cancer and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) face high rates of recurrent thromboembolism or death.", "Keywords": ["biomarkers", "neoplasms", "stroke", "thrombophilia", "thrombosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antithrombins", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Ischemic Stroke", "Neoplasms", "P-Selectin", "Thrombin", "Thromboembolism", "Thrombomodulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Babak B", "Last Name": "Navi", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cenai", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carla P", "Last Name": "Sherman", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Genova", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie M", "Last Name": "LeMoss", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hooman", "Last Name": "Kamel", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott T", "Last Name": "Tagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashish", "Last Name": "Saxena", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allyson J", "Last Name": "Ocean", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott E", "Last Name": "Kasner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Cushman", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellinor", "Last Name": "Peerschke", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "DeAngelis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH", "PubDate": "2022Sep"}, {"PMID": "35633588", "Title": "Internal Carotid Artery Angle Variations are Poorly Explained by Vascular Risk Factors: The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "The internal carotid artery (ICA) angle of origin may contribute to atherogenesis by altered hemodynamics.

C4R links this pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotyping to information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute and postacute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United States. C4R ascertains SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey conducted via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations and high-quality event surveillance. Extensive prepandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these data will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including postacute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic

We sought to explore the contribution of the modifiable and not-modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) to vulnerable plaque morphology measured by the low GSM index. A total of 1,030 stroke-free community dwelling individuals with carotid plaques present (mean age, 71.8 \u00b1 9.1; 58% women; 56% Hispanic, 20% Non-Hispanic Black, 22% Non-Hispanic White) were assessed for minimum GSM (min GSM) using high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between RFs and minGSM after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Within an individual, median plaque number was 2 (IQR: 1-3) and mean plaque number 2.3 (SD: 1.4). Mean minGSM was 78.4 \u00b1 28.7 (IQR: 56-96), 76.3 \u00b1 28.8 in men and 80 \u00b1 28.5 in women; 78.7 \u00b1 29.3 in Hispanics participants, 78.5 \u00b1 27.2 in Non-Hispanic Black participants, and 78.2 \u00b1 29 in Non-Hispanic white participants. In multivariable adjusted model, male sex (\u03b2 = -5.78, p = 0.007), obesity BMI (\u03b2 = -6.92, p = 0.01), and greater levels of fasting glucose (\u03b2 = -8.02, p = 0.02) and LDL dyslipidemia (\u03b2 = -6.64, p = 0.005) were positively associated with lower minGSM, while presence of glucose lowering medication resulted in a significant inverse association (\u03b2 = 7.68, p = 0.04). Interaction (with p for interaction <0.1) and stratification analyses showed that effect of age on minGSM was stronger in men (\u03b2 = -0.44, p = 0.03) than in women (\u03b2 = -0.20, p = 0.18), and in individuals not taking glucose lowering medication (\u03b2 = -0.33, p = 0.009). Our study has demonstrated an important contribution of glycemic and lipid metabolism to vulnerable, low density or echolucent plaque morphology, especially among men and suggested that use of glucose lowering medication was associated with more fibrose-stable plaque phenotype (greater GSM). Further research is needed to evaluate effects of medical therapies in individuals with vulnerable, low density, non-stenotic carotid plaques and how these effects translate to prevention of cerebrovascular disease.", "Keywords": ["atherosclerosis", "carotid artery", "glucose", "gray-scale median", "lipids", "plaque", "ultrasonology", "vascular risk factors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Della-Morte", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chuanhui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Milita", "Last Name": "Crisby", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Karolinska Institute, Care Sciences and Society, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Gardener", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Digna", "Last Name": "Cabral", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35105181", "Title": "Intracranial Large Artery Stenosis and Past Infectious Exposures: Results From the NOMAS Cohort.", "Abstract": "Intracranial large artery stenosis (ILAS) is an important contributor to ischemic stroke in the United States and worldwide.

This report from the AF-SCREEN International Collaboration summarizes the evidence linking AF to cognitive impairment and dementia. It provides guidance on the investigation and management of dementia in patients with AF on the basis of best available evidence. The document also addresses suspected pathophysiologic mechanisms and identifies knowledge gaps for future research. Whereas AF and dementia share numerous risk factors, the association appears to be independent of these variables. Nevertheless, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding a direct causal effect. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed, some of which are potentially amenable to early intervention, including cerebral microinfarction, AF-related cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, microhemorrhage, brain atrophy, and systemic atherosclerotic vascular disease. The mitigating role of oral anticoagulation in specific subgroups (eg, low stroke risk, short duration or silent AF, after successful AF ablation, or atrial cardiopathy) and the effect of rhythm versus rate control strategies remain unknown. Likewise, screening for AF (in cognitively normal or cognitively impaired patients) and screening for cognitive impairment in patients with AF are debated. The pathophysiology of dementia and therapeutic strategies to reduce cognitive impairment warrant further investigation in individuals with AF. Cognition should be evaluated in future AF studies and integrated with patient-specific outcome priorities and patient preferences. Further large-scale prospective studies and randomized trials are needed to establish whether AF is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, to investigate strategies to prevent dementia, and to determine whether screening for unknown AF followed by targeted therapy might prevent or reduce cognitive impairment and dementia.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "cognitive dysfunction", "dementia"], "MeSH terms": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Dementia", "Humans", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "L\u00e9na", "Last Name": "Rivard", "Affiliation": "Montreal Heart Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Canada (L.R., P.

This address interweaves personal reflections on a career in clinical neurology, stroke research, and public health with a discussion of the role of the AHA in improving cardiovascular health at multiple levels. Throughout its history, the AHA has had leaders representing many different areas of cardiovascular science and medicine, including stroke. More recently, its focus has expanded from a traditional emphasis on cardiovascular events illness and events, like heart disease and stroke, to an appreciation of the role of the vascular system in brain health, healthy aging, cognitive decline, and dementia. During the pandemic, as the bidirectional effects of the coronavirus on cardiovascular disease has been elucidated, the benefits of a broad and multidisciplinary approach to cardiovascular disease and public health have become more apparent than ever. In addition, with growing awareness of the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on communities of color in the United States and globally, the AHA has redoubled its focus on addressing the social determinants of health, including structural racism. Central to these efforts is the construction of bridges between the generation of scientific knowledge and action for the public good.

Few large U.S. population-based surveys included data on APOs. Methods: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study is a nationally representative survey of 45,971 U.S. respondents. Female respondents \u226550 years old who reported pregnancy history at the 2013-2014 baseline interview were included in this cross-sectional analysis (n\u2009=\u20093,175; weighted n\u2009=\u200935,783,619). The primary exposure was a history of \u22651 APO, including preterm delivery, low birth weight, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and stillbirth. The primary outcomes were (1) stroke before age 60 and (2) any stroke. We used weighted logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between APO and stroke, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parity, and vascular risk factors. Results: Among stroke-free respondents, 15% reported \u22651 APO. Among women who reported a stroke before age 60, 39% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009<\u20090.001); among women reporting stroke at any age, 25% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Controlling for covariates, women with APOs had increased odds of stroke before age 60 (adjusted OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.49, 4.75). The association of APOs with stroke at any age was not significant after controlling for covariates (adjusted OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93, 2.64). Conclusion: In this analysis of U.S. nationally representative survey data, APOs were independently associated with midlife stroke.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiovascular Science: Anticipating Problems and Potential Solutions: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had worldwide repercussions for health care and research. In spring 2020, most non-COVID-19 research was halted, hindering research across the spectrum from laboratory-based experimental science to clinical research. Through the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, biomedical research, including cardiovascular science, only gradually restarted, with many restrictions on onsite activities, limited clinical research participation, and the challenges associated with working from home and caregiver responsibilities. Compounding these impediments, much of the global biomedical research infrastructure was redirected toward vaccine testing and deployment. This redirection of supply chains, personnel, and equipment has additionally hampered restoration of normal research activity. Transition to virtual interactions offset some of these limitations but did not adequately replace the need for scientific exchange and collaboration. Here, we outline key steps to reinvigorate biomedical research, including a call for increased support from the National Institutes of Health. We also call on academic institutions, publishers, reviewers, and supervisors to consider the impact of COVID-19 when assessing productivity, recognizing that the pandemic did not affect all equally. We identify trainees and junior investigators, especially those with caregiving roles, as most at risk of being lost from the biomedical workforce and identify steps to reduce the loss of these key investigators.

Exposures were left atrial reservoir strain (primary), left ventricular longitudinal strain, left ventricular early diastolic strain rate, septal e' velocity, and lateral e' velocity. The primary outcome was incident ischemic stroke. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for demographics, image quality, and risk factors including left ventricular ejection fraction and incident atrial fibrillation. Among 4,000 participants in our analysis, lower (worse) left atrial reservoir strain was associated with incident ischemic stroke (HR per SD absolute decrease, 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-25). All secondary exposure variables were significantly associated with the outcome. Left atrial reservoir strain was associated with cardioembolic stroke (HR per SD absolute decrease, 1.42; 95% CI 1.21-1.67) and cardioembolic stroke related to incident atrial fibrillation (HR per SD absolute decrease, 1.60; 1.32-1.95).

This study presents novel metrics to examine the geographic alignment between COVID-19 hotspots and interventional clinical trial sites and evaluate trial access over time during the evolving pandemic. Using temporal COVID-19 case data from USAFacts.org and trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. counties were categorized based on their numbers of cases and trials. Our analysis suggests that alignment and access have worsened as the pandemic shifted over time. We recommend strategies and metrics to evaluate the alignment between cases and trials.

In this narrative review, we provide an overview of potential lacunar stroke mechanisms and discuss therapeutic implications based on the underlying mechanism. For this paper, we reviewed the literature from important studies (randomised trials, exploratory comparative studies and case series) on lacunar stroke patients with a focus on more recent studies highlighting mechanisms and stroke prevention strategies in patients with lacunar stroke. These studies suggest that lacunar stroke is a heterogeneous disease with various mechanisms, including most commonly lipohyalinosis and less commonly atheromatous disease and cardioembolism, highlighting the importance of a careful review of brain and neurovascular imaging, a cardiac and systemic evaluation. A better understanding of pathomechanisms of neurological deterioration may lead to investigating the utility of novel treatment strategies and optimisation of short-term antithrombotic treatment strategies to reduce the risk of neurological deterioration and prevent long-term disability in patients with lacunar stroke.", "Keywords": ["stroke"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name":

C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and broadly reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the US. C4R is ascertaining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations, and high-quality events surveillance. Extensive pre-pandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are being harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings.

is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in global healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4\u2009weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "COVID-19", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Patient Advocacy", "SARS-CoV-2", "Syndrome", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "Venous Thromboembolism"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ani", "Last Name": "Nalbandian", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kartik", "Last Name": "Sehgal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise.

one-third of ischemic strokes have no established mechanism after standard diagnostic evaluation and are classified as embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Failure of randomized trials to demonstrate a benefit of direct oral anticoagulants over aspirin for the treatment of ESUS as a single homogeneous entity has led to renewed interest by stroke experts to divide ESUS into subgroups. Emerging data suggest that active cancer, which is present in 5% to 10% of patients with ESUS, is a distinct and important subgroup of ESUS with unique clinical characteristics, underlying pathophysiologies, and treatment and prognostic considerations. Furthermore, the prevalence of cancer-related ESUS is expected to increase as patients with cancer, even those with distant metastases, survive longer due to improvements in cancer treatments. In this topical review, we examine the epidemiological link between ESUS and cancer, the clinical features and potential mechanistic underpinnings of ESUS with cancer (with a focus on novel biomarkers and their relationship to recurrent stroke and other thromboembolic events), and the potential treatment strategies for cancer-related ESUS. We include a critical appraisal of existing data and ongoing or planned clinical trials of different antithrombotic approaches. As cancer-related ESUS is a dynamic disease with variable course, we recommend close collaboration between neurologists and oncologists to develop individualized management plans.", "Keywords": ["anticoagulants", "biomarker", "cancer", "embolic stroke", "neoplasms", "prevalence", "prognosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Embolic Stroke", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Prevalence", "Prognosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Babak B", "Last Name": "Navi", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Unit, Brain and Mind Research Institute and Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY (B.B.N.)."}, {"First Name": "Scott E", "Last Name": "Kasner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia (S.E.K.)."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY (M.S.V.E.)."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Cushman", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington (M.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Oh Young", "Last Name": "Bang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea (O.Y.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "DeAngelis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY (B.B.N., L.M.D.)."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33501848", "Title": "Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2021 Update: A Report From the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health.

However, a notable number of additional individuals have AF that has not yet been clinically apparent or suspect-subclinical AF (SCAF). SCAF has been recognized during interrogation of pacemakers and defibrillators. More recently, SCAF has been demonstrated in prospective studies with long-term monitors-both external and implanted. The REVEAL AF trial enrolled a demographically \"enriched\" population that underwent monitoring for up to 3 years with an insertable cardiac monitor. SCAF was noted in 40% by 30 months. None of these patients had AF known before the study; however, some had nonspecific symptoms common to patients with known AF. The current study assessed whether patients with versus without such symptoms were more likely to have SCAF detected. We found that only palpitations had an association with AF detection when controlling for other baseline symptoms (hazard ratio 1.61 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.32; p\u202f=\u202f0.011). No other prescreening symptoms evaluated were associated with an increased likelihood of SCAF detection although patients without detected SCAF had an even higher frequency of symptoms than those with detected SCAF. Thus, REVEAL AF demonstrated that the presence of palpitations is associated with an increased likelihood of SCAF whereas other common symptoms are not; and, symptoms, per se, may more likely be consequent to associated disorders than they are a direct consequence of SCAF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Chest Pain", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Dizziness", "Dyspnea", "Exercise Tolerance", "Fatigue", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Pacemaker, Artificial", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Syncope", "Undiagnosed Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Reiffel", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy.

This increasingly persuasive evidence necessitates policies to reduce harmful exposures and the need to act even as the scientific evidence base continues to evolve. Policy options to mitigate the adverse health impacts of air pollutants must include the reduction of emissions through action on air quality, vehicle emissions, and renewable portfolio standards, taking into account racial, ethnic, and economic inequality in air pollutant exposure. Policy interventions to improve air quality can also be in alignment with policies that benefit community and transportation infrastructure, sustainable food systems, reduction in climate forcing agents, and reduction in wildfires. The health care sector has a leadership role in adopting policies to contribute to improved environmental air quality as well. There is also potentially significant private sector leadership and industry innovation occurring in the absence of and in addition to public policy action, demonstrating the important role of public-private partnerships.

Large health disparities exist, defined by many factors including race/ethnicity, sex, age, geography, and socioeconomic status. Studying disparities relies on measures of disease burden. Traditional measures, such as mortality, may be less applicable to neurological disorders, which often lead to substantial morbidity and lower quality of life, without necessarily causing death. Measures such as disability-adjusted life-years or healthy life expectancy may be more appropriate for assessing neurological disease and permit comparisons across diseases and communities. There are many approaches that can be used to study disparities. Analyses of population-based observational studies, patient registries, and administrative data all contribute to the understanding of disparities in humans. Animal and other experimental designs, including clinical trials, may be used to identify mechanisms and strategies to reduce disparities. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, understanding and mitigating disparities will require use of all of these methods. Crucially, a focus on not only improving outcomes among all individuals in society but minimizing or eliminating differences between those with better outcomes and those who have historically been disadvantaged should drive the ongoing investigations into disparities.

Methods and Results We used data from the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System to evaluate whether annual variability in influenza vaccination effectiveness (VE) would be associated with cardiovascular events. Daily and monthly counts of outpatient and inpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), stroke, and MI were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes; VE data for each year are publicly available. We identified pertinent lags between ILI, stroke, and MI using prewhitening cross-correlation functions and applied them to autoregressive integrated moving average time series regression models. Time series forecasting systems assessed correlations among ILI, stroke, and MI, and the effect of VE on these relationships. Cross-correlation functions indicated stroke events increased 1\u00a0month after increases in ILI rates; MIs increased immediately.

This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes. Finally, we will present a model to conceptualize the many relationships among chronic and acute infections and their short- and long-term neurological consequences. This model will suggest several directions for future research.", "Keywords": ["coronavirus", "dementia", "infection", "pneumonia", "risk factor", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Atherosclerosis", "Bacteremia", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Chronic Disease", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Endothelium", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunocompromised Host", "Infections", "Inflammation", "Influenza, Human", "Pandemics", "Platelet Activation", "Platelet Aggregation", "Pneumonia", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "SARS-CoV-2", "Stroke", "Thrombosis", "Varicella Zoster Virus Infection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY.

While age-adjusted stroke mortality was falling, it has leveled off in recent years due in part to advances in medical technology, health care options, and population health interventions. In addition to adverse trends in stroke-related morbidity and mortality across the broader population, there are sociodemographic inequities in stroke risk. These challenges can be addressed by focusing on predicting and preventing modifiable upstream risk factors associated with stroke, but there is a need to develop a practical framework that health care organizations can use to accomplish this task across diverse settings. Accordingly, this article describes the efforts and vision of the multi-stakeholder Predict & Prevent Learning Collaborative of the Value in Healthcare Initiative, a collaboration of the American Heart Association and the Robert J. Margolis, MD, Center for Health Policy at Duke University. This article presents a framework of a potential upstream stroke prevention program with evidence-based implementation strategies for predicting, preventing, and managing stroke risk factors. It is meant to complement existing primary stroke prevention guidelines by identifying frontier strategies that can address gaps in knowledge or implementation. After considering a variety of upstream medical or behavioral risk factors, the group identified 2 risk factors with substantial direct links to stroke for focusing the framework: hypertension and atrial fibrillation. This article also highlights barriers to implementing program components into clinical practice and presents implementation strategies to overcome those barriers. A particular focus was identifying those strategies that could be implemented across many settings, especially lower-resource practices and community-based enterprises representing broad social, economic, and geographic diversity. The practical framework is designed to provide clinicians and health systems with effective upstream stroke prevention strategies that encourage scalability while allowing customization for their local context.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "cardiovascular diseases", "cause of death", "hypertension", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Status Disparities", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Medication Adherence", "Patient Education as Topic", "Patient Participation", "Primary Prevention", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Social Determinants of Health", "Stroke", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vincent J", "Last Name": "Bufalino", "Affiliation": "AdvocateAuroraHealth, Naperville, IL (V.J.B.)."}, {"First Name": "William K", "Last Name": "Bleser", "Affiliation": "Robert J.

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

We sought to evaluate whether depressive symptoms are associated with active smoking among survivors of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). To do this, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2016). We included participants \u226520\u00a0years old with prior stroke or MI and any history of smoking. Symptoms of depression, at survey participation, were ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Active smoking was defined using self-report and, secondarily, with cotinine measures. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between depression and active smoking after adjusting for demographics, smoking-related medical conditions, and health-related behaviors. We found that, among stroke and MI survivors with any history of smoking, 37.9% (95% CI, 34.5-41.3%) reported active smoking and 43.8% (95% CI, 40.3-47.3%) had biochemical evidence of smoking. Rates of active smoking were similar for stroke and MI survivors. Twenty-one percent screened positive for depression. In adjusted models, depression was associated with active smoking in the combined group of stroke and MI survivors (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.24-4.20) and in stroke survivors (odds ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.20-7.38). Tests of heterogeneity by event type did not reveal an interaction. Findings were similar when using cotinine measures. We conclude that symptoms of depression were associated with active smoking among stroke and MI survivors.

We systematically reviewed data on this topic by searching Medline, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion in patients with stroke and TIA. We included studies that reported rates of smoking cessation, worsening or recurrent cerebrovascular disease, seizures, or neuropsychiatric events. We identified 2 RCTs and 6 observational studies; 3 included ischemic stroke and TIA, 2 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 3 did not specify. Four studies assessed efficacy; cessation rates ranged from 33% to 66% with pharmacological therapy combined with behavioral interventions versus 15% to 46% without, but no individual study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Safety data for varenicline and buopropion in ischemic stroke were scarce. Patients with SAH who received NRT had more seizures (9% vs 2%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and delirium (19% vs 7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) in one study, but less frequent vasospasm in 3 studies. In conclusion, combined with behavioral interventions, smoking-cessation therapies resulted in numerically higher cessation rates.

This study examines race/ethnic differences in stroke incidence in the multiethnic, largely Caribbean Hispanic, NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study), and whether disparities vary by age. Methods- The study population included participants in the prospective population-based NOMAS, followed for a mean of 14\u00b17 years. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and incident stroke of any subtype and ischemic stroke, stratified by age. Results- Among 3298 participants (mean baseline age 69\u00b110 years, 37% men, 24% black, 21% white, 52% Hispanic), 460 incident strokes accrued (400 ischemic, 43 intracerebral hemorrhage, 9 subarachnoid hemorrhage). The most common ischemic subtype was cardioembolic, followed by lacunar infarcts, then cryptogenic. The greatest incidence rate was observed in blacks (13/1000 person-years), followed by Hispanics (10/1000 person-years), and lowest in whites (9/1000 person-years), and this order was observed for crude incidence rates until age 75. By age 85, the greatest incidence rate was in Hispanics. Blacks had an increased risk of stroke versus whites overall in multivariable models that included sociodemographics (hazard ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.13-2.02]), and stratified analyses showed that this disparity was driven by women of age \u226570. The increased rate of stroke among Hispanics (age/sex-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.13-1.93]) was largely explained by education and insurance status (a proxy for socieoeconomic status; hazard ratio after further adjusting for these variables, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.85-1.62]) but remained significant for women age \u226570. Conclusions- This study provides novel data regarding the increased stroke risk among Caribbean Hispanics in this elderly population. Results highlight the need to create culturally tailored campaigns to reach black and Hispanic populations to reduce race/ethnic stroke disparities and support the important role of low socioeconomic status in driving an elevated risk among Caribbean Hispanics.", "Keywords": ["cardiovascular disease", "cohort studies", "incidence", "prevalence", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Black People", "Brain Ischemia", "Cohort Studies", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Healthcare Disparities", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "Prospective Studies", "Racial Groups", "Risk Factors", "Social Class", "Stroke", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Gardener", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL (H.G., R.L.S., T.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL (H.G., R.L.S., T.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL (H.G., R.L.S., T.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Battistella", "Affiliation": "Stroke Unit, Vila Nova de Gaia and Espinho Hospital Center, Portugal (V.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Ying Kuen", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman Public School of Health (Y.K.C.), Columbia University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons (M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "32045925", "Title": "Physical Activity, Hormone Therapy Use, and Stroke Risk among Women in the California Teachers Study Cohort.", "Abstract": "Postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of stroke.

Furthermore, associations with region-specific white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) are underexplored. Methods- Using data from the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study), a prospective cohort study of stroke risk and cognitive aging, we examined associations between systolic blood pressure and DBP, defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, with regional WMHV. We used a linear mixed model approach to account for the correlated nature of regional brain measures. Results- The analytic sample (N=1205; mean age 64\u00b18 years) consisted of 61% women and 66% Hispanics/Latinos. DBP levels were significantly related to WMHV differentially across regions (P for interaction<0.05). Relative to those with DBP 90+ mm\u2009Hg, participants with DBP <80 mm\u2009Hg had 13% lower WMHV in the frontal lobe (95% CI, -21% to -3%), 11% lower WMHV in the parietal lobe (95% CI, -19% to -1%), 22% lower WMHV in the anterior periventricular region (95% CI, -30% to -14%), and 16% lower WMHV in the posterior periventricular region (95% CI, -24% to -6%). Participants with DBP 80 to 89 mm\u2009Hg also exhibited about 12% (95% CI, -20% to -3%) lower WMHV in the anterior periventricular region and 9% (95% CI, -18% to -0.4%) lower WMHV in the posterior periventricular region, relative to participants with DBP 90\u2265 mm\u2009Hg. Post hoc pairwise t tests showed that estimates for periventricular WMHV were significantly different from estimates for temporal WMHV (Holms stepdown-adjusted P<0.05).

We sought to investigate whether subclinical liver disease, specifically liver fibrosis, is associated with clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods- We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Intracerebral Hemorrhage. We included adult patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset. We calculated 3 validated fibrosis indices-Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4 score, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score-and modeled them as continuous exposure variables. Primary outcomes were admission hematoma volume and hematoma expansion. Secondary outcomes were mortality, and the composite of major disability or death, at 90 days. We used linear and logistic regression models adjusted for previously established risk factors. Results- Among 432 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, the mean Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index, Fibrosis-4, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score values on admission reflected intermediate probabilities of fibrosis, whereas standard hepatic assays and coagulation parameters were largely normal. After adjusting for potential confounders, Aspartate Aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index was associated with hematoma volume (\u03b2, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.04-0.36]), hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.3]), and mortality (odds ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]). Fibrosis-4 was also associated with hematoma volume (\u03b2, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.07-0.47]), hematoma expansion (odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-3.0]), and mortality (odds ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1-3.6]). Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score was not associated with any outcome. Indices were not associated with the composite of major disability or death.

Subclinical Cerebrovascular Disease in Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Elevated blood pressure (BP) level is one of the most consistently identified risk factors for silent brain disease. BP values obtained at the proximal segment of the aorta (central BP) are more directly involved than brachial BP in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. However, the association between central BP and silent cerebrovascular disease has not been clearly established. Participants in the CABL (Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions) study (n=993; mean age, 71.7\u00b19.3 years; 37.9% men) underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography, arterial wave reflection analysis for determination of central BPs, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Central BPs were calculated from the radial pulse waveform. Subclinical silent cerebrovascular disease was defined as silent brain infarction and white matter hyperintensity volume. Both brachial (P=0.014) and central pulse pressure (P=0.026) were independently associated with silent brain infarctions after adjustment for clinical variables, but not adjusting for each other. None of the brachial BP values was associated with upper quartile of white matter hyperintensity volume in multivariable analysis.

We sought to assess the relationship between total serum cholesterol (TC) variability and cranial MRI findings of subclinical or covert vascular brain injury in a longitudinal, population-based cohort study of older adults. Methods- In the Cardiovascular Health Study, we assessed associations between intraindividual TC mean, trend, and variability over \u22485 years with covert brain infarction (CBI) and white matter grade (WMG) on cranial MRI. Mean TC was calculated for each study participant from 4 annual TC measurements between 2 MRI scans. TC trend was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of the TC measurements, and TC variability was calculated as the SD of the residuals from the linear regression. We evaluated the association of intraindividual TC variability with incident CBI and worsening WMG between 2 MRI scans in primary analyses and with prevalent CBI number and WMG on the follow-up MRI scan in secondary analyses. Results- Among participants who were eligible for the study and free of clinical stroke before the follow-up MRI, 17.9% of 1098 had incident CBI, and 27.8% of 1351 had worsening WMG on the follow-up MRI. Mean, trend, and variability of TC were not associated with these outcomes. TC variability, independent of mean and trend, was significantly associated with the number of CBI (\u03b2=0.009 [95% CI, 0.003-0.016] P=0.004; N=1604) and was associated with WMG (\u03b2, 0.009 [95% CI, -0.0002 to 0.019] P=0.055; N=1602) on the follow-up MRI.

Methods- We used brain magnetic resonance imaging from 1290 stroke-free participants in the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) to evaluate for CBI. We classified CBI as cardioembolic (ie, known atrial fibrillation), large artery atherosclerosis (extracranial and intracranial), penetrating artery disease, and cryptogenic (no apparent cause). CBI localized in the nonmotor areas of the right hemisphere were considered noneloquent. We then evaluated risk of events by CBI subtype with adjusted Cox proportional models. Results- At the time of magnetic resonance imaging, 236 participants (18%) had CBI (144 [61%] distal cryptogenic, 29 [12%] distal cardioembolic, 26 [11%] large artery atherosclerosis, and 37 [16%] penetrating artery disease). Smaller (per mm, odds ratio, 0.8 [0.8-0.9]) and nonbrain stem infarcts (odds ratio, 0.2 [0.1-0.6]) were more likely to be covert. During the follow-up period (10.4\u00b13.1 years), 398 (31%) died (162 [13%] of vascular death) and 117 (9%) had a stroke (99 [85%]) were ischemic. Risks of events varied by CBI subtype, with the highest risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 2.2 [1.3-3.7]) and vascular death (hazard ratio, 2.24 [1.29-3.88]) noted in participants with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis-related CBI. Conclusions- CBI can be classified into subtypes that have differential outcomes.

Methods- We evaluated 4 groups of 10 subjects prospectively enrolled at 3 centers from 2009 to 2018. This included the group of interest with active solid tumor cancer and AIS and 3 control groups with active cancer only, AIS only, or vascular risk factors only. Subjects in the AIS-only and cancer-only groups were matched to subjects in the cancer-stroke group by age, sex, and cancer type (if applicable). Subjects in the vascular risk factor group were matched to subjects in the cancer-stroke and stroke-only groups by age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Blood was drawn 72 to 120 hours after stroke. Total RNA was processed using 3' mRNA sequencing. ANOVA and Fisher least significant difference contrast methods were used to estimate differential gene expression between groups. Results- In the cancer-stroke group, 50% of strokes were cryptogenic. All groups had differentially expressed genes that could distinguish among them. Comparing the cancer-stroke group to the stroke-only group and after accounting for cancer-only genes, 438 genes were differentially expressed, including upregulation of multiple genes/pathways implicated in autophagy signaling, immunity/inflammation, and gene regulation, including IL (interleukin)-1, interferon, relaxin, mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, SQSTMI1 (sequestosome-1), and CREB1 (cAMP response element binding protein-1). Conclusions- This study provides evidence for a distinctive molecular signature in blood mRNA expression profiles of patients with cancer-related AIS. Future studies should evaluate whether blood mRNA can predict detection of occult cancer in patients with AIS. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

Infections have been identified as a trigger for strokes in young people and have been associated with strokes during delivery hospitalizations, but a temporal relationship has been difficult to establish. We hypothesized that infections diagnosed during a delivery admission would be associated with an increased risk of readmission for postpartum stroke. Methods- We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014. Using weighted survey design Poisson regression analysis, we calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CI for the association between infection during delivery admission and 30-day postpartum readmission for IS or HS. Results- Out of 17.2 million delivery admissions during the study period, 2128 were readmitted within 30 days for a stroke of any type. There were 1189 HS (intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage) and 720 IS, and the remainder unspecified pregnancy-related stroke. Adjusting for age and comorbidities, women with delivery infections were at higher risk of readmission for postpartum stroke of any type (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41). Women with infections had higher risk of readmission for postpartum IS (aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22), but not for postpartum HS (aRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75-1.23). The effect of infection on 30-day IS readmission was larger in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (aRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.55-2.69 in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy versus aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.9-2.38 in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, P value for interaction=0.09). Conclusions- Infection during delivery hospitalization was associated with increased risk of readmission for IS, but not HS, within 30 days postpartum, particularly in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

We aim to study the associations between left atrial volume index (LAVI) and embolic stroke subtypes and atrial fibrillation (AF) detection on cardiac event monitoring in patients with embolic stroke of unknown source. Methods- Data were collected from a prospective cohort of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke admitted to a comprehensive stroke center over 18 months. Stroke subtype was classified into cardioembolic stroke, noncardioembolic stroke of determined mechanism (NCE), or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Univariate and prespecified multivariable analyses were performed to assess associations between LAVI and stroke subtype and AF detection in patients with ESUS. Results- Of 1224 consecutive patients identified during the study period, 1020 (82.6%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography and had LAVI measurements. LAVI was greater in patients with cardioembolic stroke than NCE (41.4 mL/m2\u00b118.0 versus 28.6 mL/m2\u00b112.2; P<0.001) but not in ESUS versus NCE (28.9 mL/m2\u00b112.6 versus 28.6 mL/m2\u00b112.2; P=0.61). In multivariable logistic regression models, LAVI was greater in cardioembolic stroke versus NCE (adjusted odds ratio per mL/m2, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09; P<0.001) but not in ESUS versus NCE (adjusted odds ratio per mL/m2, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02; P=0.720).

Methods- Our decision analysis compared anticipated functional outcomes for patients within the IV-tPA (intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator) treatment window in the mothership and drip-and-ship frameworks. Key branches of the model included IV-tPA eligibility, presence of an LVO, and endovascular therapy eligibility. Our decision analysis evaluated 2 prehospital LVO screening approaches: (1) no formal screening and (2) the use of clinical LVO screening scales. An excellent outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale scores 0-1. Probabilities and workflow times were guideline-based or imputed from published studies. In sensitivity analyses, we individually and jointly varied transport time to the nearest primary stroke center, additional time required to transport directly to a comprehensive stroke center, and LVO screening scale predictive probabilities. We evaluated 2 separate scenarios: one in which ideal time metrics were achieved and one under current real-world metrics. Results- In the ideal metrics scenario, the drip-and-ship strategy was almost always favored in the absence of formal LVO screening. For patients screened positive for an LVO, mothership was favored if the additional transport time to the comprehensive stroke center was <3 to 23 minutes. Under real-world conditions, in which primary stroke center workflow is slower than ideal, the mothership strategy was favored in more scenarios, regardless of formal LVO screening. For example, mothership was favored with an additional transport time to the comprehensive stroke center of <32 to 99 minutes for patients screened positive for an LVO and <28 to 39 minutes in the absence of screening. Conclusions- Joint consideration of LVO probability, screening, workflow times, and transport times may improve prehospital stroke triage.

We sought to identify predictors of stroke after sepsis and bloodstream infections. Methods- The 2007-2009 California State Inpatient Database from the Health Care Utilization Project was used to identify patients over the age of 18 years and hospitalized with sepsis or bloodstream infection defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Patients who died during their sepsis hospitalization were excluded. The primary outcome was a primary diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke on a subsequent hospitalization within 1 year. Associations between risk factors, also defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, and stroke were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. A composite risk score was generated to predict stroke risk. Results- Of 121\u2009947 patients with sepsis, 0.5% (n=613) had a primary diagnosis of stroke within a year of their sepsis hospitalization. Significant predictors for stroke were identified. A score was generated from these risk factors with points assigned based on regression coefficients: valvular heart diseases (1 point), congestive heart failure (1), renal failure (1), lymphoma (2), peripheral vascular diseases (2), pulmonary circulation disorders (2), and coagulopathy (3). The C statistic for the receiver operating characteristic curve for the score was 0.68. The risk of stroke increased 43% (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.37-1.48) per-point increase in the score.

We describe a medically-refractory case of CVST in a 35-year-old woman later found to have JAK2 mutation and essential thrombocytosis. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Forty-hours of continuous-tPA in addition to systemic intravenous-heparin led to complete radiographic and clinical resolution of CVST. Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially. Our findings were speculative and hypothesis generating as to whether this explained medical treatment failure. If there are coagulopathy differences at local sites of injury not adequately captured by peripheral blood draws, further investigation is required to identify better approaches to avoid under-treatment of similar cases.", "Keywords": ["Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis", "anticoagulation", "intracranial coagulopathy", "rotational thromboelastometry"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Coagulation", "Cerebral Angiography", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Endovascular Procedures", "Female", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Humans", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Janus Kinase 2", "Mutation", "Phlebography", "Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial", "Thrombectomy", "Thrombelastography", "Thrombocythemia, Essential", "Thrombolytic Therapy", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "Treatment Failure"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York.

However, the validity of these symptoms in identifying flow compromise in patients has not been well established. We examined whether hypoperfusion symptoms correlated with quantitative measurements of flow compromise in the prospective, observational VERiTAS study (Vertebrobasilar Flow Evaluation and Risk of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke). Methods- VERiTAS enrolled patients with recent vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack or stroke and \u226550% atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion in vertebral or basilar arteries. Hemodynamic status using vertebrobasilar large vessel flow was measured using quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, and patients were designated as low, borderline, or normal flow based on distal territory regional flow, incorporating collateral capacity. The presence of qualifying event hypoperfusion symptoms was assessed relative to the quantitatively determined flow status (normal versus borderline/low) and also examined as a predictor of subsequent stroke risk. Results- Of the 72 enrolled subjects, 66 had data on hypoperfusion symptoms available. On initial quantitative magnetic resonance angiography designation, 43 subjects were designated as normal flow versus 23 subjects designated as low flow (n=16) or borderline flow (n=7). Of these, 5 (11.6%) normal flow and 3 (13.0%) low/borderline flow subjects reported at least one qualifying event hypoperfusion symptom ( P=0.99, Fisher exact test). Hypoperfusion symptoms had a positive predictive value of 37.5% and negative predictive value of 65.5% for low/borderline flow status. Compared with flow status, which strongly predicted subsequent stroke risk, hypoperfusion symptoms were not associated with stroke outcome ( P=0.87, log-rank test). Conclusions- These results suggest that hypoperfusion symptoms alone correlate poorly with actual hemodynamic compromise as assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance angiography and subsequent stroke risk in vertebrobasilar disease, and are not a reliable surrogate for flow measurement.

We hypothesized that common infections occurring during the stroke stay are associated with 30dRA. Methods- We conducted a weighted analysis of the federally managed 2013 National Readmission Database to assess the relationship between infection during a stroke hospitalization and 30dRA among ischemic stroke survivors. Ischemic stroke, common infections (defined as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection), and comorbidities were identified using International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision ( ICD-9) diagnosis codes, and intravenous tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) or intra-arterial therapy was identified using ICD-9 procedure codes. Survey design logistic regression models were fit to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI for the association between infections and 30dRA. Results- Among 319\u2009317 ischemic stroke patients, 12.1% were readmitted within 30 days, and 29% had an infection during their index hospitalization. Patients with infection during their stroke admission had a 21% higher odds of being readmitted than patients without any type of infection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.26). The association between infection and unplanned readmission was similar with an increased odds of unplanned readmission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.18-1.29). When assessing specific types of infections, only urinary tract infections were associated with 30dRA in adjusted models (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.16).

This metric has been used to define optimal brain health, but data relative to subclinical imaging biomarkers of brain aging are lacking. This study examines the association between Life's Simple 7 with white matter hyperintensity volume, silent brain infarcts, and cerebral volume. Methods and Results A subsample of stroke-free participants from the population-based Northern Manhattan Study underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging an average of 7\u00a0years after baseline. Linear and logistic regression models were constructed to estimate associations between the number of ideal CVH metrics achieved with imaging biomarkers of brain aging, adjusting for sociodemographics. Among 1031 participants (mean age at magnetic resonance imaging=72\u00b18, 40% men, 19% black, 16% white, and 65% Hispanic), no one had ideal status in all 7 factors, 1% had ideal status in 6 factors, 18% in 4 to 5 factors, 30% in 3 factors, 33% in 2 factors, and 18% in 0 to 1 factors. The number of ideal CVH factors achieved was inversely associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (beta per factor=-0.047; P=0.04) and silent brain infarct (odds ratio per factor=0.84; 95% confidence interval=0.72-0.97) and positively associated with cerebral volume (beta per factor=0.300; P=0.002). Conclusions An increasing ideal CVH score was associated with less white matter hyperintensity volume and silent brain infarcts and greater cerebral volumes, supporting the Life's Simple 7 metric as a useful measure to quantify optimal brain health.

We developed a novel severity scoring system designed to quantify FCA progression and correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods- The VIPS study (Vascular Effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke) prospectively enrolled 355 children with arterial ischemic stroke (2010-2014), including 41 with centrally confirmed FCA. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed FCA cerebrovascular imaging, assigning a graded severity score of zero (no involvement) to 4 (occlusion) to individual arterial segments. The FCA severity score (FCASS) was the unweighted sum. In an iterative process, we modeled scores derived from different combinations of arterial segments to identify the model that optimized correlation with clinical outcome, simplicity, and reliability. Results- The optimal FCASS summed scores from 5 arterial segments: supraclinoid internal carotid artery, A1, A2, M1, and M2. The median (interquartile range) baseline FCASS was 4 (2-6). Of 33 children with follow-up imaging, the maximum FCASS (at any time point) was 7 (5-9). Twenty-four (73%) had FCA progression on follow-up with their maximum FCASS at a median of 8 (5-35.5) days poststroke; their median FCASS increase was 4 (2.5-6). FCASS did not correlate with recurrent arterial ischemic stroke. Maximum (but not baseline) FCASS correlated with 1-year pediatric stroke outcome measures ( P=0.037).

In this study, we aim to investigate the yield of TTE in patients with ischemic stroke and known subtype and whether the admission troponin level improves the yield of TTE. Methods- Data were abstracted from a single-center prospective ischemic stroke database for 18 months and included all patients with ischemic stroke whose etiologic subtype could be obtained without the need of TTE. Unadjusted and adjusted regression models were built to determine whether positive cardiac troponin levels (\u22650.1 ng/mL) improve the yield of TTE, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results- We identified 578 patients who met the inclusion criteria. TTE changed clinical management in 64 patients (11.1%), but intracardiac thrombus was detected in only 4 patients (0.7%).

Currently, no risk stratification model exists to predict RTE in this population. We tested the hypothesis that the Khorana score, a validated risk model for predicting venous thromboembolism in cancer patients, can effectively classify RTE risk in cancer patients with AIS. We retrospectively identified adults with active solid or hematological cancer diagnosed with AIS at a tertiary-care cancer center from 2005 to 2010. The Khorana score at the time of index stroke was calculated. The primary outcome was arterial or venous RTE. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of the Khorana score and its individual components with RTE. Harrell's c-statistic was used to calculate the score's discriminatory ability. Among 263 AIS patients, median survival was 84\u202fdays (IQR 24-149\u202fdays) and 90 (34%) had RTE. The median Khorana score was 2 (IQR 1-2, range 0-5). Cumulative rate of RTE was 28% among patients who scored 0, 36% with scores of 1-2, and 32% with scores of 3-6. The overall Khorana score was marginally associated with RTE (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.28). Of its individual components, only leukocytosis was associated with RTE (HR adjusted for other components, 1.45; 95% CI 1.11-1.90). The score's c-statistic for predicting RTE was 0.57. In this study, the Khorana score had poor discriminatory ability for predicting RTE in cancer patients with AIS.

Periodic visits may also monitor a secondary irreversible event influencing the event of primary interest, and a significant proportion of subjects develop the secondary event over the period of follow-up. The status of the secondary event serves as a time-varying covariate, but is recorded only at the times of the scheduled visits, generating incomplete time-varying covariates. While information on a typical time-varying covariate is missing for entire follow-up period except the visiting times, the status of the secondary event are unavailable only between visits where the status has changed, thus interval-censored. One may view interval-censored covariate of the secondary event status as missing time-varying covariates, yet missingness is partial since partial information is provided throughout the follow-up period. Current practice of using the latest observed status produces biased estimators, and the existing missing covariate techniques cannot accommodate the special feature of missingness due to interval censoring. To handle interval-censored covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model, we propose an available-data estimator, a doubly robust-type estimator as well as the maximum likelihood estimator via EM algorithm and present their asymptotic properties.

Our study investigated the relationship between adventitial and intimal CD3+ T cells and brain arterial remodeling that potentially contributes to HIV-related vasculopathy and stroke. Large brain arteries from 84 HIV+ cases and 78 HIV- cases were analyzed to determine interadventitial and luminal diameters, intimal and wall thickness, percent stenosis, and the presence of atherosclerosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect and visually score CD3, a pan-T-cell marker, in the intima and adventitia. Our study showed that numbers of adventitial CD3+ T cells are lower among persons with HIV than among those without HIV, especially if CD4 counts are <200, though intimal CD3+ T cell numbers did not differ by HIV status. Among those with HIV but CD4 counts of <200 at the time of death, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic outward remodeling, while among those with HIV and CD4 of >200 or HIV- controls, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic inward remodeling. We conclude that intimal lymphocytic inflammation is involved in brain arterial remodeling that may contribute to HIV-related cerebrovascular pathology.IMPORTANCE Although mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has decreased with the use of combination antiretroviral therapies, there is now an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease associated with HIV. Thus, there is a need to understand the pathogenesis of stroke in HIV infection. Our study examines how lymphocytic inflammation in brain arteries may contribute to increased cerebral vasculopathy. With this understanding, our study can potentially help direct future therapies to target and prevent brain arterial remodeling processes associated with HIV.", "Keywords": ["T lymphocytes", "brain arterial remodeling", "human immunodeficiency virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "CD3 Complex", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Arteries", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "T-Lymphocytes", "Vascular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adele", "Last Name": "Shenoy", "Affiliation": "New York Medical College, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology and Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Randolph", "Last Name": "Marshall", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Morgello", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York jg3233@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2018Jun15"}, {"PMID": "29558467", "Title": "Cerebral white matter disease and functional decline in older adults from the Northern Manhattan Study: A longitudinal cohort study.", "Abstract": "Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI are common and associated with vascular and functional outcomes.

In this study we aim to look at the association between impaired perfusion and early stroke recurrence in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease or total cervical carotid occlusion. Methods This is a retrospective study from a comprehensive stroke center where we included consecutive patients 18 years or older with intracranial atherosclerotic disease or total cervical carotid occlusion admitted with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke within 24\u2009h from symptom onset with National Institute Health Stroke Scale\u2009<\u200915, between 1 December 2016 and 30 June 2017. Patients with (1) evidence of\u2009\u2265\u200950% stenosis of a large intracranial artery or total carotid artery occlusion, (2) symptoms referable to the territory of the affected artery, and (3) perfusion imaging data using the RAPID processing software were included. The primary predictor was unfavorable perfusion imaging defined as Tmax\u2009>\u20096\u2009s mismatch volume (penumbra volume-infarct volume) of 15\u2009ml or more. The outcome was recurrent cerebrovascular events at 90 days defined as worsening or new neurological symptoms in the absence of a nonvascular cause attributable to the decline, or new infarct or infarct extension in the territory of the affected artery. We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between impaired perfusion and recurrent cerebrovascular events. Results Sixty-two patients met our inclusion criteria; mean age 66.4\u2009\u00b1\u200913.1 years, 64.5% male (40/62) and 50.0% (31/62) with intracranial atherosclerotic disease. When compared to patients with favorable perfusion pattern, patients with unfavorable perfusion pattern were more likely to have recurrent cerebrovascular events (55.6% (10/18) versus 9.1% (4/44), p\u2009<\u20090.001). This association persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted hazard ratio 10.44, 95% confidence interval 2.30-47.42, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Conclusion Perfusion mismatch predicts recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease or total cervical carotid occlusion.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and BP values obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as compared to office BP measurements, and the effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on the relationship. The study population consisted of 813 subjects participating in the cardiovascular abnormalities and brain lesions (CABL) study who underwent 24-h ABPM. Office BP (mean of two measurements) was found to be associated with increasing BMI, for both SBP (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) and DBP (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). In contrast, there was no association seen of increasing BMI with ABPM parameters in the overall cohort, even after adjusting for age and gender. However, among subjects not on anti-hypertensive treatment, office SBP and DBP measurements were significantly correlated with increasing BMI (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) as were daytime SBP and 24-h SBP, although with a smaller spread across BMI subgroups compared with office readings. In treated hypertensives, there was only a trend toward increasing office DBP and increasing DBP variability with higher BMI. Our results suggest that body mass may have a less significant influence on BP values in the elderly when ABPM rather than office measurements are considered, particularly in patients receiving anti-hypertensive treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Body Mass Index", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stacy W", "Last Name": "Baird", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhezhen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kazue", "Last Name": "Okajima", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cesare", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Epidemiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shunichi", "Last Name": "Homma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Human Genetics, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marco R", "Last Name": "Di Tullio", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. md42@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of human hypertension", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29167390", "Title": "Early Elevated Troponin Levels After Ischemic Stroke Suggests a Cardioembolic Source.", "Abstract": "Elevated cardiac troponin is a marker of cardiac disease and has been recently shown to be associated with embolic stroke risk.

We hypothesized that greater left-right white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) asymmetry was associated with functional trajectories. Methods: In the Northern Manhattan Study, participants underwent brain MRI with axial T1, T2, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences, with baseline interview and examination. Volumetric WMHV distribution across 14 brain regions was determined separately by combining bimodal image intensity distribution and atlas based methods. Participants had annual functional assessments with the Barthel index (BI, range 0-100) over a mean of 7.3 years. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models estimated associations of regional WMHV and regional left-right asymmetry with baseline BI and change over time, adjusted for baseline medical risk factors, sociodemographics, and cognition, and stroke and myocardial infarction during follow-up. Results: Among 1,195 participants, greater WMHV asymmetry in the parietal lobes (-8.46 BI points per unit greater WMHV on the right compared to left, 95% CI -3.07, -13.86) and temporal lobes (-2.48 BI points, 95% CI -1.04, -3.93) was associated with lower overall function. Greater WMHV asymmetry in the parietal lobes (-1.09 additional BI points per year per unit greater WMHV on the left compared to right, 95% CI -1.89, -0.28) was independently associated with accelerated functional decline. Conclusions: In this large population-based study with long-term repeated measures of function, greater regional WMHV asymmetry was associated with lower function and functional decline.

We sought to examine the interrelationship of these imaging biomarkers and the influence of hypertension in older individuals. We used a multivariate spatial covariance neuroimaging technique to localize the effects of white matter lesion load on regional gray matter volume and assessed the role of blood pressure control, age and education on this relationship. Using a case-control design matching for age, gender, and educational attainment we selected 64 participants with normal blood pressure, controlled hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension from the Northern Manhattan Study cohort. We applied gray matter voxel-based morphometry with the scaled subprofile model to (1) identify regional covariance patterns of gray matter volume differences associated with white matter lesion load, (2) compare this relationship across blood pressure groups, and (3) relate it to cognitive performance. In this group of participants aged 60-86 years, we identified a pattern of reduced gray matter volume associated with white matter lesion load in bilateral temporal-parietal regions with relative preservation of volume in the basal forebrain, thalami and cingulate cortex. This pattern was expressed most in the uncontrolled hypertension group and least in the normotensives, but was also more evident in older and more educated individuals. Expression of this pattern was associated with worse performance in executive function and memory. In summary, white matter lesions from small-vessel disease are associated with a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy that is mitigated by blood pressure control, exacerbated by aging, and associated with cognitive performance.", "Keywords": ["aging", "brain atrophy", "cerebrovascular disease", "cognition", "hypertension", "scaled subprofile model", "voxel-based morphometry", "white matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyle C", "Last Name": "Kern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Evelyn F.

Assessment of baseline demographic factors, risk factors, and laboratory studies included measurement of TNFR1 (n\u00a0=\u00a01,863). Generalized estimating equations models were used to estimate standardized associations between TNFR1 and 1) baseline functional status and 2) change in function over time, adjusting for demographic factors, vascular risk factors, social variables, cognition, and depression, as well as stroke and MI occurrence during follow-up. The mean age of participants was 70 (standard deviation (SD), 10) years; 66% were women, and 55% were Hispanic. The mean TNFR1 level was 2.57 mg/L.

Risk factors for stroke can be categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity are nonmodifiable risk factors for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, while hypertension, smoking, diet, and physical inactivity are among some of the more commonly reported modifiable risk factors. More recently described risk factors and triggers of stroke include inflammatory disorders, infection, pollution, and cardiac atrial disorders independent of atrial fibrillation. Single-gene disorders may cause rare, hereditary disorders for which stroke is a primary manifestation. Recent research also suggests that common and rare genetic polymorphisms can influence risk of more common causes of stroke, due to both other risk factors and specific stroke mechanisms, such as atrial fibrillation. Genetic factors, particularly those with environmental interactions, may be more modifiable than previously recognized. Stroke prevention has generally focused on modifiable risk factors. Lifestyle and behavioral modification, such as dietary changes or smoking cessation, not only reduces stroke risk, but also reduces the risk of other cardiovascular diseases. Other prevention strategies include identifying and treating medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, that increase stroke risk. Recent research into risk factors and genetics of stroke has not only identified those at risk for stroke but also identified ways to target at-risk populations for stroke prevention.", "Keywords": ["cerebrovascular disorders", "epidemiology", "risk factors", "stroke", "transient ischemic attack"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Diet", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Life Style", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amelia K", "Last Name": "Boehme", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health (A.K.B., M.S.V.E.) and Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons (A.K.B., C.E., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Esenwa", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health (A.K.B., M.S.V.E.) and Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons (A.K.B., C.E., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health (A.K.B., M.S.V.E.) and Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons (A.K.B., C.E., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY. mse13@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Circulation research", "PubDate": "2017Feb03"}, {"PMID": "28130470", "Title": "Predictors of incident epilepsy in older adults: The Cardiovascular Health Study.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence, incidence, and predictors of epilepsy among older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Medicare", "Multivariate Analysis", "Prevalence", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Racial Groups", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Stroke", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hyunmi", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA. hc323@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Pack", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA."}, {"First Name": "W T", "Last Name": "Longstreth", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA."}, {"First Name": "Thanh G N", "Last Name": "Ton", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA."}, {"First Name": "Frankline", "Last Name": "Onchiri", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (H.C., A.P., M.S.V.E.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Departments of Neurology (W.T.L.) and Epidemiology (W.T.L., F.O.), University of Washington, Seattle; Precision Health Economics (T.G.N.T.), Oakland, CA; and Seattle Children's Research Institute (F.O.), WA."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2017Feb28"}, {"PMID": "28123058", "Title": "Procalcitonin and Midregional Proatrial Natriuretic Peptide as Biomarkers of Subclinical Cerebrovascular Damage: The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "Chronic infections and cardiac dysfunction are risk factors for stroke.

Risk factor management is complicated by polypharmacy-related adverse events. Aims To characterize the impact of physical inactivity for stroke by age in a multi-ethnic prospective cohort study (NOMAS, n\u2009=\u20093298). Methods Leisure time physical activity was assessed by a validated questionnaire and our primary exposure was physical inactivity (PI). Participants were followed annually for incident stroke. We fit Cox-proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (HR 95% CI) for the association of PI and other risk factors with risk of stroke including two-way interaction terms between the primary exposures and age (<80 vs.\u2009\u226580). Results The mean age was 69\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 years and 562 (17%) were\u2009\u226580 at enrolment. PI was common in the cohort (40.8%). Over a median of 14 years, we found 391 strokes. We found a significant interaction of age\u2009\u226580 on the risk of stroke with PI ( p\u2009=\u20090.03). In stratified models, PI versus any activity (adjusted HR 1.60, 95%CI 1.05-2.42) was associated with an increased risk of stroke among those\u2009\u226580.

This study investigated the relationship between CKD and left atrial (LA) volume and function in a sample of the general population without overt cardiac disease. Design and methods We examined 358 participants from the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study. The LA minimum volume index (LAVImin), LA maximum volume index (LAVImax), and LA emptying fraction (LAEF) were assessed by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography. Based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the participants were divided into a CKD group (eGFR <60\u2009ml/min/1.73\u2009m2) and a non-CKD group (eGFR \u226560\u2009ml/min/1.73\u2009m2). Results Of the 358 participants, 69 (19%) were classified as having CKD and 289 (81%) as non-CKD. Participants with CKD were older, had a greater prevalence of hypertension and use of antihypertensive drugs, a larger left ventricular (LV) mass index, and a higher prevalence of diastolic dysfunction than those without CKD (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). There was no significant difference in LAVImax between the CKD and non-CKD groups (23.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1 vs. 22.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u2009ml/m2, p\u2009=\u20090.47), whereas significant differences were observed for LAVImin (13.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5 vs. 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6\u2009ml/m2, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and LAEF (42.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 vs. 47.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the eGFR was significantly associated with LAEF independent of age, LV mass index, and diastolic dysfunction (all p\u2009<\u20090.05).

The risk of stroke is increased by both the acute and chronic phases of a wide spectrum of proinflammatory conditions, suggesting that the association is related to activation of the inflammatory response rather than the condition itself. Different inflammatory mechanisms probably influence the risk of different stroke subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by observations that high levels of various immune system markers and acute phase reactants in otherwise healthy individuals have also been associated with ischaemic stroke subtypes. C-reactive protein, IL-6 and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 are some of the inflammatory markers that have been associated with stroke risk and prognosis. Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated that these markers are associated with the risk of stroke, but the value of these markers in a clinical setting has not yet been proven. Further research is needed to determine whether immune system modulators can lower the risk of stroke in individuals with elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers. Here, we review the association between infection, systemic inflammation, and ischaemic stroke, and discuss the currently recommended preventive methods to decrease the risk of stroke associated with systemic inflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase", "Biomarkers", "Brain Ischemia", "C-Reactive Protein", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "Esenwa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, Neurological Institute, 710 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, Neurological Institute, 710 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

The evidence from cohort studies supporting this change was sparse, particularly among US minority populations. In the Northern Manhattan Study, 1750 participants aged \u226560 years and free of stroke, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease had SBP measured at baseline and were annually followed up for incident stroke. Mean age at baseline was 72\u00b18 years, 63% were women, 48% Hispanic, 25% non-Hispanic white, and 25% non-Hispanic black. Among all participants, 40% were on antihypertensive medications; 43% had SBP <140 mm\u2009Hg, 20% had 140 to 149 mm\u2009Hg, and 37% had \u2265150 mm\u2009Hg. Over a median follow-up of 13 years, 182 participants developed stroke. The crude stroke incidence was greater among individuals with SBP\u2265150 mm\u2009Hg (10.8 per 1000 person-years) and SBP 140 to 149 (12.3) than among those with SBP<140 (6.2). After adjusting for demographics, vascular risk factors, diastolic BP, and medication use, participants with SBP 140 to 149 mm\u2009Hg had an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.6) compared with those with SBP <140 mm\u2009Hg. The increased stroke risk was most notable among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Raising the SBP threshold from 140 to 150 mm\u2009Hg as a new target for hypertension treatment in older individuals without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease could have a detrimental effect on stroke risk reduction, especially among minority US populations.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "cardiovascular diseases", "continental population groups", "epidemiology", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chuanhui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (C.D., D.D.-M., T.R., C.B.W., R.L.S.), Department of Public Health Sciences (T.R., C.B.W., R.L.S.), and John T.
