[{"PMID": "38830454", "Title": "Mercury, natural fertility and outcomes of assisted reproduction: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The primary route of mercury exposure for the general population is through consumption of contaminated seafood. There is a biological basis for an adverse effect of mercury exposure on human fertility. The goal of this review was to evaluate the existing literature on the association between mercury and pregnancy, among men and women attempting to conceive with and without assisted reproductive technology (ART). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science for papers published up to March 2023 with no early date restriction, only including studies with a biomarker measurement of mercury exposure. We identified 11 studies examining mercury and natural fertility and 12 studies examining mercury and outcomes of assisted reproduction (implantation or clinical pregnancy). The accumulated evidence provides some support for a null association between bodily mercury concentrations and natural fertility among women, however, a large proportion of studies did not report adjusted estimates or were extremely imprecise. The majority of studies of natural fertility were also cross-sectional in nature. There was no evidence for an inverse or null association between mercury and natural fertility among men, or mercury and ART outcomes among men or women. In spite of biological plausibility, the existing evidence includes studies that are imprecise and often conflicting and does not allow us to make definitive conclusions on the associations of mercury exposure with successful pregnancy. Additional, larger studies are warranted, especially among individuals with high concentrations of mercury exposure as these individuals may be underrepresented in the current literature.", "Keywords": ["Assisted reproductive technology", "Fertility", "Mercury"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Angley", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States."}, {"First Name": "Liping", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Health Science, College of Health, Ball State University,\u00a0Muncie,\u00a0IN,\u00a0United States."}, {"First Name": "Yijia", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States."}, {"First Name": "Penelope P", "Last Name": "Howards", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health,\u00a0Emory University,\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0GA,\u00a0United States."}, {"First Name": "Ka", "Last Name": "Kahe", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DM, owing to its promotion of oxidative stress, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance. HHcy can result from low status of one-carbon metabolism (OCM) nutrients (e.g., folate, choline, betaine, vitamin B6, B12), which work together to degrade homocysteine by methylation. The etiology of HHcy may also involve genetic variation encoding key enzymes in OCM. This review aimed to provide an overview of the existing literature assessing the link between OCM nutrients status, related genetic factors, and incident DM. We also discussed possible mechanisms underlying the role of OCM in DM development and provided recommendations for future research and practice. Even though the available evidence remains inconsistent, some studies support the potential beneficial effects of intakes or blood levels of OCM nutrients on DM development. Moreover, certain variants in OCM-related genes may influence metabolic handling of methyl-donors and presumably incidental DM. Future studies are warranted to establish the causal inference between OCM and DM and examine the interaction of OCM nutrients and genetic factors with DM development, which will inform the personalized recommendations for OCM nutrients intakes on DM prevention.", "Keywords": ["Betaine", "Choline", "Diabetes mellitus", "Folic acid", "Genes", "Homocysteine", "Riboflavin"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Folic Acid", "Nutrients", "Hyperhomocysteinemia", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Carbon", "Genetic Variation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Nutrition and Foods Program, School of Family and Consumer Sciences, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gunjana", "Last Name": "Saikia", "Affiliation": "Nutrition and Foods Program, School of Family and Consumer Sciences, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaotao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Translational Epidemiology & Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxi", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ka", "Last Name": "Kahe", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vagelos College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Diabetes & metabolism journal", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "38354711", "Title": "The association between lead exposure and dental caries \u2500 a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Dental caries has declined over the years, but it remains a major public health issue.

Because the adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with combustible cigarette smoking are well-recognized, many pregnant women switch to e-cigarettes believing that this alternative is low in toxic chemicals. However, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which can easily pass through the placenta and accumulate to a high concentration in fetal blood circulation. Studies have also detected toxic metals (eg, lead, cadmium, and nickel) in e-cigarettes, and carbonyl compounds and flavorings, which are suggested to be irritative and even carcinogenic. There are questions that need to be answered about the risks of e-cigarette exposure during pregnancy. Unfortunately, research evaluating the association between maternal e-cigarette exposure and offspring health is scarce, especially with regard to human studies. Some evidence from laboratory and animal studies, although inconsistent, showed that maternal exposure to e-cigarette vapor may lead to restricted growth of offspring. E-cigarette exposure may also have an impact on the metabolic health of offspring, manifested as distorted glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. In addition, in utero exposure may lead to defects in respiratory, vascular, and neurologic system development. For humans, investigations mostly focused on immediate birth outcomes such as small-for-gestational-age neonates, low birthweight, and preterm birth; however, the results were inconclusive.

In the systematic review, nine eligible studies were summarized. Six occupational studies indicated inconsistent associations between cumulative radon exposure and CeVD mortality among mine workers. With available data from four updated occupational studies (99,730 mine workers and 2745 deaths), the pooled RR of radon exposure with CeVD mortality showed a non-significant association (1.10, 95% CI 0.92, 1.31).

While ionizing radiation has been suggested as a risk factor of dementia for decades, studies exploring the possible role of radon exposure in the development of Alzheimer's Diseases (AD) and other dementias are sparse.

Although magnesium intake has been related to mood and cardio-metabolic disease, its relation with hostility remains unclear. We hypothesize that high total magnesium intake is associated with lower levels of hostility because of its putative antidepressant mechanisms. To test the hypothesis, we prospectively analyzed data in 4,716 young adults aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-1986) from four U.S. cities over five years of follow-up using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)\u00a0study. Magnesium intake was estimated from a dietary history questionnaire plus supplements at baseline. Levels of hostility were assessed using the Cook-Medley scale at baseline and year 5 (1990-1991). Generalized estimating equations were applied to estimate the association of magnesium intake with hostility as repeated measures at the two time-points (baseline and year 5). General linear model was used to determine the association between magnesium intake and change in hostility over 5 years. After adjustment for socio-demographic and major lifestyle factors, a significant inverse association was observed between magnesium intake and hostility level over 5 years of follow-up. Beta coefficients (95% CI) across higher quintiles of magnesium intake were 0 (reference), -1.28 (-1.92, -0.65), -1.45 (-2.09, -0.81), -1.41 (-2.08, -0.75) and -2.16 (-2.85, -1.47), respectively (Plinear-trend<.01). The inverse association was independent of socio-demographic and major lifestyle factors, supplement use, and depression status at year 5.
