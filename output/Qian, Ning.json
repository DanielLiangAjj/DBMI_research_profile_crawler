Nevertheless, the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy remains limited in most clinical settings due to the lack of a preexisting antitumor T-cell response in tumors. Therefore, the clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapy must be improved crucially. With increased awareness of the importance of the innate immune response in the recruitment of T cells, as well as the onset and maintenance of the T cell response, great interest has been shown in activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to awaken the innate immune response, thereby orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses to induce tumor clearance. However, tumor cells have evolved to overexpress ectonucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), which degrades the immunotransmitter 2',3'-cGAMP and promotes the production of immune-suppressing adenosine, resulting in inhibition of the anticancer immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Clinically, ENPP1 overexpression is closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Conversely, depleting or inhibiting ENPP1 has been verified to elevate extracellular 2',3'-cGAMP levels and inhibit the generation of adenosine, thereby reinvigorating the anticancer immune response for tumor elimination. A variety of ENPP1 inhibitors have recently been developed and have demonstrated significant promise for cancer immunotherapy.

Using next-generation sequencing technology, we examined the genomic alterations of diploid S. cerevisiae isolates that were subcultured on a medium containing 1.2 g/L 5-HMF. We found that in 5-HMF-treated cells, the rates of chromosome aneuploidy, large deletions/duplications, and loss of heterozygosity were elevated compared with that in untreated cells. 5-HMF exposure had a mild impact on the rate of point mutations but altered the mutation spectrum. Contrary to what was observed in untreated cells, more monosomy than trisomy occurred in 5-HMF-treated cells. The aneuploidy mutant with monosomic chromosome IX was more resistant to 5-HMF than the diploid parent strain because of the enhanced activity of alcohol dehydrogenase. Finally, we found that overexpression of ADH6 and ZWF1 effectively stabilized the yeast genome under 5-HMF stress.

Furthermore, the coupling coordination degree between new urbanization and ecological efficiency is discussed with the coupling degree model, Markov chain, and spatial correlation methods, and its influencing factors are explored by the geographic detector. The results show that: (1) The development trends of new urbanization and ecological efficiency in Zhejiang Province counties both present a \"U\" shape. Their inflection points appeared in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The gap between counties is gradually narrowing. (2) The coupling coordination degree between new urbanization and ecological efficiency in Zhejiang Province counties also develops in a \"U\" shape with the minimum value appearing in 2006. Its temporal evolution is dominated by advancement towards a higher level and maintenance of the original type, with most countries advancing from General Disorder to Preliminary Coordination. There is a good positive correlation in the spatial distribution, showing significant High-High and Low-Low agglomeration. (3) In detecting the driving factors, the explanatory power of economic development, natural conditions and social conditions diminishes sequentially. The interaction groups mostly are nonlinear enhancements, and the rest are all two-factor enhancements. Social factors are the main interaction objects. (4) The empirical analysis verified the efficacy of the \"Two Mountains\" theory and the importance of government investment in the regional coordinated development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Urbanization", "China", "Environment", "Economic Development", "Entropy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lindong", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "School of Management, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310023, China."}, {"First Name": "Weixiang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Management, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanxiao", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Xingzhi College, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, 321100, China."}, {"First Name": "Shouchao", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Wenzhou University of Technology, Wenzhou, 325027, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenjun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Zhijiang College, Zhejiang University of Technology, Shaoxing, 312030, China."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ning", "Affiliation": "College of Humanities, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, 321000, China."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37573519", "Title": "Distributions of Visual Receptive Fields from Retinotopic to Craniotopic Coordinates in the Lateral Intraparietal Area and Frontal Eye Fields of the Macaque.", "Abstract": "Even though retinal images of objects change their locations following each eye movement, we perceive a stable and continuous world. One possible mechanism by which the brain achieves such visual stability is to construct a craniotopic coordinate by integrating retinal and extraretinal information. There have been several proposals on how this may be done, including eye-position modulation (gain fields) of retinotopic receptive fields (RFs) and craniotopic RFs. In the present study, we investigated coordinate systems used by RFs in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) cortex and frontal eye fields (FEF) and compared the two areas. We mapped the two-dimensional RFs of neurons in detail under two eye fixations and analyzed how the RF of a given neuron changes with eye position to determine its coordinate representation. The same recording and analysis procedures were applied to the two brain areas. We found that, in both areas, RFs were distributed from retinotopic to craniotopic representations. There was no significant difference between the distributions in the LIP and FEF. Only a small fraction of neurons was fully craniotopic, whereas most neurons were between the retinotopic and craniotopic representations. The distributions were strongly biased toward the retinotopic side but with significant craniotopic shifts. These results suggest that there is only weak evidence for craniotopic RFs in the LIP and FEF, and that transformation from retinotopic to craniotopic coordinates in these areas must rely on other factors such as gain fields.", "Keywords": ["Eye-centered", "Head-centered", "Reference frames", "Visual stability"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Macaca", "Visual Fields", "Frontal Lobe", "Eye Movements", "Brain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Division of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Division of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China."}, {"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neuroscience, Key Laboratory of Primate Neurobiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mingsha", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Division of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China. mingsha.zhang@bnu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Neuroscience bulletin", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "37569188", "Title": "Use of Tandem Mass Spectrometry Quantitative Proteomics to Identify Potential Biomarkers to Follow the Effects of Cold and Frozen Storage of Muscle Tissue of Litopenaeus vannamei.", "Abstract": "L. vannamei has become one of the most productive species.

This study investigates the relationship between changes in the proteome of Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) muscle and quality characteristics during low-temperature storage using the tandem mass spectrometry technology of quantitative proteomics strategy. The differential expression of proteins under cold storage (4 \u00b0C, CS), partial slight freezing (-3 \u00b0C, PFS), and frozen storage (-18 \u00b0C, FS) conditions was compared with the fresh group (CK), resulting in 1572 proteins identified as differentially expressed. The purpose of this research is to identify potential biochemical markers by analyzing quality changes and relative differential proteins through searches in the UniProt database, Gene Ontology database, and Genome Encyclopedia. Correlation analysis revealed that seven DEPs were significantly related to physical and chemical indicators. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that most DEPs are involved in binding proteins, metabolic enzymes, and protein turnover. Additionally, some DEPs were identified as potential biomarkers for muscle decline.

A total of 17 healthy adults (11 women and 6 men, mean age: 21.59 \u00b1 2.12) underwent two nights of polysomnogram recordings in the sleep laboratory. We analyzed sleep structure and central and autonomic nervous system activity during stage N2 and applied the electroencephalographic (EEG) activation index (beta/delta power ratio) and heart rate variability to reflect changes in central and autonomic nervous system activity caused by the FNE. Correlation analyses were performed between EEG activation and heart rate variability. The results showed that EEG activation and high-frequency heart rate variability increased on the adaptation night (Night 1). Importantly, EEG activation was significantly associated with the percentage of stage N1, and the correlation between EEG activation and high-frequency heart rate variability decreased due to the FNE.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to fill this gap in image denoising application by connecting model-guided design (MoD) with NAS (MoD-NAS). Specifically, we propose to construct a new search space under a model-guided framework and develop more stable and efficient differential search strategies. MoD-NAS employs a highly reusable width search strategy and a densely connected search block to automatically select the operations of each layer as well as network width and depth via gradient descent. During the search process, the proposed MoD-NAS remains stable because of the smoother search space designed under the model-guided framework.

Although tuning curves and the corresponding population responses contain the same information, they can have different properties. These differences are known to be important because the perception of a stimulus should be decoded from its population response, not from any single tuning curve. The differences are less studied in the spatial domain where a cell's spatial tuning curve is simply its receptive field (RF) profile. Here, we focus on evaluating the common belief that perrisaccadic forward and convergent RF shifts lead to forward (translational) and convergent (compressive) perceptual mislocalization, respectively, and investigate the effects of three related factors: decoders' awareness of RF shifts, changes of cells' covering density near attentional locus (the saccade target), and attentional response modulation. We find that RF shifts alone produce either no shift or an opposite shift of the population responses depending on whether or not decoders are aware of the RF shifts. Thus, forward RF shifts do not predict forward mislocalization. However, convergent RF shifts change cells' covering density for aware decoders (but not for unaware decoders) which may predict convergent mislocalization.

Given the essential role of innate immunity in cancer immune surveillance, tremendous effort has been focused on the innate immune pathways that can be pharmacologically modulated to improve the clinical outcome of checkpoint inhibitors. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway plays essential roles in host defense against cancers. Activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway induces the expression of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in promotion of a robust adaptive antitumor immunity. As part of this innate immune signaling pathway, STING is ubiquitously expressed in immune and nonimmune cells. STING activation has been demonstrated to propagate the cancer immunity cycle, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and ultimately eliminate tumor cells. The immunomodulatory roles of STING enable it to be an appealing target for cancer immunotherapy. As such, STING agonists that are capable of triggering antitumor immune responses have been developed in recent years, and several of them have advanced into clinical trials. In this review, we first give an overview on the STING signaling pathway, then dissect the roles of STING activation in different steps of the cancer immunity cycle and finally discuss the development of STING agonists as well as challenges with STING activation, with the potential to make cancer immunotherapy with STING agonists more effective.", "Keywords": ["Cancer immunity cycle", "Cancer immunotherapy", "STING agonists"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors", "Membrane Proteins", "Immunotherapy", "Nucleotidyltransferases", "Neoplasms", "Immunity, Innate", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruilei", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ning", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China; College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Jihui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuhong", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}, {"First Name": "Luting", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}, {"First Name": "Shengsong", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory for Antibody-Based Drug and Intelligent Delivery System, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China; College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China; Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Drug Research, and Institute of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China.

In March 2018, field investigations showed that a leaf spot disease occurred on T. repens in three fields with 50% to 80% incidence (50 plants in each field were investigated) in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province of China. Infected leaves showed symptoms of irregular dark brown spots in the center of leaves or at the leaf margins. Symptomatic leaves were surface sterilized with 3% NaClO for 3 min followed by 75% ethanol for 30 s and then rinsed in sterile water three times. Thereafter, tissue samples from margins of individual lesions were placed on potato dextrose agar and incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark. Four pure cultures (Y3-1; Y3-2; Y3-3; Y3-4) were obtained by single spore isolation. On oatmeal agar medium, a colony reached 57 mm diameter after 9 d in alternating light and dark at 25\u2103. Fimbriate aerial hypha were flat and compact with pale brown to dark brown color. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth, ampulliform to doliiform (n = 30), ranging from 4.1 to 10.5 \u03bcm long (6.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5m) \u00d7 2.2 to 5.7 \u03bcm wide (4.1 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5m). Conidia were ellipsoidal to cylindrical, hyaline, thin walled, smooth, aseptate, with 2 to 4 polar guttules (n = 50), ranging from 3.2 to 11.3 \u03bcm long (6.3 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5m) \u00d7 2.1 to 4.1 \u03bcm wide (2.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m).

Sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers: ON705759 to ON705766, ON734043 to ON734046 and ON841585 to ON841592. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with combined sequences of the five loci using the maximum likelihood (ML) and the maximum parsimony (MP) methods. The four isolates and the extype strain of B. linicola (CBS 116.76) clustered together with high bootstrap support (BS) values (MLBS = 100; MPBS = 98).

Based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic results, our isolates were identified as B. linicola, although the morphological characteristics of CBS 116.76 had not been characterized. To assess pathogenicity, a conidial suspension (approximately 105 CFU/mL) of isolate Y3-1 was sprayed on 1-month-old healthy plants in a greenhouse at 22\u2103 to 28\u2103. Plants sprayed with sterilized water were used as negative controls. The test was conducted three times, each with 3 plants. After 10 days, the leaves of the plants showed irregular brown lesions that were similar to the symptoms observed in the field, control plants remained healthy. The pathogen was reisolated and confirmed to be B. linicola, thus completing the verification of Koch's Postulates.

The infected leaves were collected and disinfected with 75% alcohol for 30 sec and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, followed by three rinses in sterilized ddH2O, dried on sterilized filter paper, and incubated on water agar for 48 h under continuous fluorescent light at 26\u2103. Then, typical pyriform and 2-septate conidia (23.97 - 30.37 \u00d7 7.42 - 9.98 \u03bcm, N = 30) appeared at the lesions (Fig. 1B). Four single-spore were captured, and then grew on oatmeal tomato agar for seven days under continuous fluorescent light at 26\u2103 to obtain four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b and -9c) and produce conidia for inoculation tests. The colony morphology of LY-ZY-7b on OTA was gray and floccose, and the growth rate was 6.15 - 6.31 mm/d at 26 \u00b0C (Fig. 1C). Spores of LY-ZY-7b were washed off with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 to make spore suspensions. For scratch inoculation, 10 \u03bcL spore suspension (1 \u00d7 105 spores/mL) was inoculated on the wound scratched with a sterilized pin along the vein (3 mm \u00d7 3 mm) on palm grass middle leaf of 4-week-old seedlings. The inoculated leaves were sealed in a 15-cm Petri dish. For spray inoculation, 20 mL spore suspension (5 \u00d7 104 spores/mL) was made and sprayed on ten healthy palm grasses of 4-week-old seedlings. Plants used as negative controls were sprayed with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 (Liu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2014). After inoculation, all plants were put into transparent boxes to maintain > 95% humidity and covered with black plastic bags for one day. Then, the boxes containing the plants were placed in a growth chamber at 26\u00b0C (12 h light / 12 h darkness photoperiod). After six days, typical blast-type lesions with brown-yellow edges were visible on the leaves. Control plants did not show symptoms (Fig. 1D, 1E). Microscopical examination showed that the conidia and conidiophore recovered from the lesion of the inoculated plants have the same morphology as those recovered from natural infected tissues (Fig. 1F, 1G). The colony morphology of the pathogen isolated from the artificially inoculated tissue was consistent with that of isolate LY-ZY-7b (Fig. 1C). The spore suspension (5 \u00d7 104 spores/mL) of isolate LY-ZY-7b and one rice-infecting strain P131 (Yang et al., 2010) was made and sprayed onto 4-week-old seedlings of three rice cultivars. But unfortunately, isolate LY-ZY-7b could not cause any disease lesions on the tested rice cultivars, whereas strain P131 produced many typical blast lesions on rice leaves (Fig. 1H). Then, the fungal genetic identity of four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) was confirmed by comparison of the sequence obtained from partial DNA of Actin (ACT), ITS, and RPB1 loci from our isolates and those previously published by Klaubauf et al. 2014. The nucleotide sequences of ACT, ITS, and RPB1 were submitted to GenBank ON228695-ON228697 (ACT), ON210978-ON210980 (ITS), ON228698-ON228701 (RPB1). A phylogenetic tree deduced from a maximum likelihood analysis based on combined ACT-ITS-RPB1 sequence data of Pyricularia showed that these four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) clustered together on Pyricularia oryzae, with a high bootstrap support value (Fig. 2). Based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogeny, these four isolates were identified as P. oryzae (Klaubauf et al. 2014; Qi et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of blast disease on palm grass caused by P. oryzae in China, which will help develop disease management strategies against palm grass blast. Moreover, as a host of P. oryzae, palm grass might contribute as an inoculum source for blast diseases on cereal crops (such as rice, wheat, and barley) caused by P. oryzae in the field.", "Keywords": ["Koch\u2019s postulate", "Setaria palmifolia", "molecular phylogeny", "morphological characteristics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jintao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University, 34752, College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, 2 West Yuanmingyuan Road, Beijing, Beijing, China, 100193; liujt0801@qq.com."}, {"First Name": "Rufeng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University College of Plant Protection, 539443, Department of Plant Biosecurity, Beijing, China; ameng_wang@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "2 West Yuanmingyuan Roadbeijing, beijing , China, 100193; SY20183192472@cau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jialing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University College of Plant Protection, 539443, Beijing, China; 1094146428@qq.com."}, {"First Name": "Wensheng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University College of Plant Protection, 539443, Department of Plant Biosecurity, Beijing, China; mppzhaws@cau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Junjie", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, 538741, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Changsha, Hunan, China; xingjunjie@hhrrc.ac.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University, 34752, Plant Pathology, No 2 Yuanmingyuan W Rd, Haidian Dist, Beijing, China, 100193; yangj@cau.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Plant disease", "PubDate": "2022Jul11"}, {"PMID": "35504059", "Title": "T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain in cancer immunotherapy: A focus on tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells.", "Abstract": "T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a novel type of immune checkpoint.

MicroRNA-10b-5p (miR-10b-5p) has been extensively studied in different fields. This study set out to probe into the effect of miR-10b-5p in cyclic mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis in HASMCs. The results showed that after 15 % deformation, 0.5 s stretching and 0.5 s cyclic mechanical stretching relaxation (0.5 Hz) occurred to HASMCs, miR-10b-5p showed up-regulation without inducing significant apoptosis. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of FLT1 were reduced. Then, dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that FLT1 was targeted by miR-10b-5p, and miR-10b-5p silencing increased FLT1 expression, leading to a prolonged arrest of stretch-treated HASMCs at the G1/S stage, and increased cell apoptosis compared with control group. Furthermore, the activity of Caspase-3 was reinforced, and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was markedly reduced after miR-10b-5p silencing. The current study proved that expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt in stretch-treated HASMCs of the inhibition group were significantly inhibited in comparison to those of the controls. The effects of miR-10b-5p overexpression are opposite to that of inhibition of miR-10b-5p in stretched HASMCs. In conclusion, this study showed that miR-10b-5p silencing could weaken the hypertrophy of HASMCs.

In breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the derived stromal components have been recognized as comprising the majority of the pathological structure of the TME. In this study, we show that metformin (Met), a diabetes drug, transforms CAFs in the TME. Met disrupts tumor-stromal cross talk by preventing breast cancer cell transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling and the production of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by CAFs. The suppression of bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and CAFs by Met is attributed to increased phospho-AMP kinase (p-AMPK) levels. By upregulating p-AMPK in CAFs, Met induces prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), leading to the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in CAFs. Moreover, interruption of HIF-1\u03b1-driven SDF-1 signaling in CAFs by Met leads to decreased breast cancer cell invasion.

MicroRNA-182-5p (miR-182-5p) has been reported as a key miRNA in regulating the proliferation and migration of various cell types, and its dysfunction contributes is implicated in a wide range of pathological processes. Yet, it remains unknown whether miR-182-5p modulates the proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells during asthma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the potential role of miR-182-5p in regulating the proliferation and migration of ASM cells induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in vitro. We found that TNF-\u03b1 stimulation markedly reduced miR-182-5p expression in ASM cells. Gain-of-function experiments showed that miR-182-5p upregulation suppressed the proliferation and migration of ASM cells induced by TNF-\u03b1. By contrast, miR-182-5p inhibition had the opposite effect. Notably, tripartite motif 8 (TRIM8) was identified as a target gene of miR-182-5p. TRIM8 expression was induced by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, and TRIM8 knockdown markedly impeded TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, miR-182-5p overexpression or TRIM8 knockdown significantly downregulated the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) induced by TNF-\u03b1. However, TRIM8 restoration partially reversed the miR-182-5p-mediated inhibitory effect on TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, our study indicates that miR-182-5p restricts TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration through downregulation of NF-\u03baB activation via targeting TRIM8.

Clinically, PDK2 expression was up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma and was correlated to the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. Mechanically, PDK2 promoted cell growth and Cisplatin-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma via transcriptional regulation of cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 3 (CNNM3), indicating that PDK2-CNNM3 signalling axis could be a potential therapeutic target for Cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma.", "Keywords": ["CNNM3", "Lung adenocarcinoma", "PDK2", "cisplatin-resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cisplatin", "Cyclins", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase", "Up-Regulation", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tinghua", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "b Department of General Surgery , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ning", "Affiliation": "a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "c Department of Oncology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shannxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "c Department of Oncology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shannxi , China."}, {"First Name": "Manxiang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "a Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi , China."}], "Journal": "Journal of drug targeting", "PubDate": "2019Apr"}, {"PMID": "30160218", "Title": "Loss of Beclin1 Expression and Nrf2 Overexpression are Associated with Poor Survival of Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.", "Abstract": "Nrf2 pathway and autophagy are abnormally activated in response to cellular stress in various types of human cancers.

The debate is particularly relevant for tasks involving target perturbation, which can alter movement kinematics. To simulate such tasks, finite-horizon models require two preset movement durations to compute two control policies before and after the perturbation. Another model employs infinite- and finite-horizon formulations to determine, respectively, movement durations and control policies, which are updated every time step. We adopted an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model that, unlike previous approaches, does not preset movement durations or use multiple control policies. It contains both control-dependent and independent noises in system dynamics, state-dependent and independent noises in sensory feedbacks, and different delays and noise levels for visual and proprioceptive feedbacks. We analytically derived an optimal solution that can be applied continuously to move an effector toward a target regardless of whether, when, or where the target jumps. This single policy produces different numbers of peaks and \"submovements\" in velocity profiles for different conditions and trials. Movements that are slower or perturbed later appear to have more submovements. The model is also consistent with the observation that subjects can perform the perturbation task even without detecting the target jump or seeing their hands during reaching. Finally, because the model incorporates Weber's law via a state representation relative to the target, it explains why initial and terminal visual feedback are, respectively, less and more effective in improving end-point accuracy. Our work suggests that the number of peaks or submovements in a velocity profile does not necessarily reflect the number of motor impulses and that the difference between initial and terminal feedback does not necessarily imply a transition between open- and closed-loop strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center for Brain-Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China lizhe07@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Mazzoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, U.S.A. mazzonip@wustl.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sen", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Engineering and Center for Brain-Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China songsen@tsinghua.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, U.S.A. nq6@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29141874", "Title": "S100A4 amplifies TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a pleural mesothelial cell line.", "Abstract": "Pleural fibrosis can dramatically lower the quality of life. Numerous studies have reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is involved in fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism is inadequately understood. Fibroblast-specific protein-1 (S100A4) is a target of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. In our previous study, we have reported that S100A4 is highly expressed in pleural fibrosis. Thus, we suggest that S100A4 took part in the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in pleural fibrosis. In this study, we determined the expression of S100A4 and EMT-related markers in Met-5A cells (pleural mesothelial cells) treated with TGF-\u03b2 or TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor by real-time PCR and western blot. In order to explore the role of S100A4, we used siRNA to knock down the expression of S100A4 in cell model. We found that the expression of epithelial cell marker was decreased and the mesenchymal cell marker increased with S100A4 upregulation after treatment with TGF-\u03b2. Moreover, the changes of EMT-related event were restricted when the expression of S100A4 was knocked down. Conversely, S100A4 can partially rescue the EMT-related expression changes induced by TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor. These findings suggest that S100A4 expression is induced by the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and silencing S100A4 expression can inhibit the process of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT.", "Keywords": ["Phenotype", "chronic disease", "fibroblast growth factors", "transforming growth factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Epithelium", "Humans", "Pleura", "Pyrazoles", "Quinolines", "S100 Calcium-Binding Protein A4", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Ning", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Feiyan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Tinghua", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhongmin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiration and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29073108", "Title": "Visual perception as retrospective Bayesian decoding from high- to low-level features.", "Abstract": "When a stimulus is presented, its encoding is known to progress from low- to high-level features. How these features are decoded to produce perception is less clear, and most models assume that decoding follows the same low- to high-level hierarchy of encoding. There are also theories arguing for global precedence, reversed hierarchy, or bidirectional processing, but they are descriptive without quantitative comparison with human perception. Moreover, observers often inspect different parts of a scene sequentially to form overall perception, suggesting that perceptual decoding requires working memory, yet few models consider how working-memory properties may affect decoding hierarchy. We probed decoding hierarchy by comparing absolute judgments of single orientations and relative/ordinal judgments between two sequentially presented orientations. We found that lower-level, absolute judgments failed to account for higher-level, relative/ordinal judgments. However, when ordinal judgment was used to retrospectively decode memory representations of absolute orientations, striking aspects of absolute judgments, including the correlation and forward/backward aftereffects between two reported orientations in a trial, were explained. We propose that the brain prioritizes decoding of higher-level features because they are more behaviorally relevant, and more invariant and categorical, and thus easier to specify and maintain in noisy working memory, and that more reliable higher-level decoding constrains less reliable lower-level decoding.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian prior", "adaptation theory", "bidirectional tilt aftereffect", "efficient coding", "interreport correlation"], "MeSH terms": ["Bayes Theorem", "Humans", "Memory, Short-Term", "Models, Neurological", "Nontherapeutic Human Experimentation", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Columbia College, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Cueva", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Covert attention to a peripheral site appears to define a similar reference center but previous studies did not control for confounding spatiotemporal factors or investigate the relationship between overt- and covert-attention-defined centers.

The two SRC effects jointly determined the overall motor reaction time. Since trials with different cue locations were randomly interleaved, the integration of the two reference centers must be updated online.

Pectin-doxorubicin conjugates (PDC), a macromolecular pro-drug, were prepared via an amide condensation reaction, and a novel amphiphilic core-shell micell based on a PDC macromolecular pro-drug (PDC-M) was self-assembled in situ, with pectin as the hydrophilic shell and doxorubicin (DOX) as the hydrophobic core. Then the chemical structure of the PDC macromolecular pro-drug was identified by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR), and proved that doxorubicin combined well with the pectin and formed macromolecular pro-drug. The PDC-M were observed to have an unregularly spherical shape and were uniform in size by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average particle size of PDC-M, further measured by a Zetasizer nanoparticle analyzer (Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments), was about 140 nm. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were 57.82% \u00b1 3.7% (n = 3) and 23.852% \u00b12.3% (n = 3), respectively. The in vitro drug release behaviors of the resulting PDC-M were studied in a simulated tumor environment (pH 5.0), blood (pH 7.4) and a lysosome media (pH 6.8), and showed a prolonged slow release profile. Assays for antiproliferative effects and flow cytometry of the resulting PDC-M in HepG2 cell lines demonstrated greater properties of delayed and slow release as compared to free DOX. A cell viability study against endothelial cells further revealed that the resulting PDC-M possesses excellent cell compatibilities and low cytotoxicities in comparison with that of the free DOX. Hemolysis activity was investigated in rabbits, and the results also demonstrated that the PDC-M has greater compatibility in comparison with free DOX. This shows that the resulting PDC-M can ameliorate the hydrophobicity of free DOX.

It seems necessary to combine information across scales. A coarse-to-fine disparity energy model, with both position- and phase-shift receptive fields, has already been proposed. However, because each scale decodes only one disparity for each location and uses the decoded disparity to select cells at the next scale, this model cannot represent overlapping surfaces at different depths. We have extended the model to solve stereo transparency. First, we introduce multiplicative connections from cells at one scale to the next to implement coarse-to-fine computation. The connection is the strongest when the presynaptic cell's preferred disparity matches the postsynaptic cell's position-shift parameter, encouraging the next scale to encode residual disparities with the more reliable phase-shift mechanism. This modification not only eliminates the artificial decoding and selection steps of the original model but also enables maintenance of complete population responses throughout the coarse-to-fine process. Second, because of this modification, explicit decoding is no longer necessary but rather is for visualization only. We use a simple threshold criterion to decode multiple disparities from population energy responses instead of a single disparity in the original model. We demonstrate our model using simulations on a variety of transparent and nontransparent stereograms. The model also reproduces psychophysically observed disparity interactions (averaging, thickening, attraction, and repulsion) as the depth separation between two overlapping planes varies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Computer Simulation", "Form Perception", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Psychological", "Neurons", "Vision Disparity", "Vision, Binocular", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China lizhe07@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2015May"}, {"PMID": "25544568", "Title": "Notch1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the cancer stem cell phenotype in breast cancer cells and STAT3 plays a key role.", "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women.

Aberrant methylation and hypernomic histone deacetylation have been implicated in the silencing of ARHI. To investigate the mechanism of ARHI induction, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were either transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI, or were simultaneously treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, [trichostatin A, (TSA)] and the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). The latter treatment group also included the targeting of ARHI by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to further examine interactions between ARHI and the drugs applied. Levels of ARHI were detected by western blotting, MTT assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation, and both cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry. Both the transfection of pcDNA3.1(+)\u2011ARHI and the application of TSA+DAC induced the expression of ARHI. Furthermore, reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis were observed for both groups compared to controls. However, a G1/S cell cycle arrest was observed for the pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI group, while a G2 cell cycle arrest was observed for the TSA+DAC group. The latter effect was reversed with the introduction of ARHI-targeted siRNA in combination with TSA+DAC treatment. To further clarify these observations, expression levels of several key cell cycle regulators were analyzed by western blotting. The pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI group exhibited higher expression levels of p53, p21 and p27, and lower levels of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 when compared to the control group (P<0.05). For the TSA+DAC group, higher levels of p53, p21, cyclin B1 and Chk1 were detected, concomitant with lower levels of CDK1, when compared to the control group.

It was suggested that TNBC exhibited a worse 7-year survival compared with that in non-TNBC patients, most likely due to its more aggressive behavior and insensitivity to specific therapy.", "Keywords": ["clinicopathological characteristics", "prognostic analysis", "survival analysis", "triple-negative breast cancer"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

Shikonin is an anti-inflammatory phytocompound obtained from Lithospermum erythrorhizon whose potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of endometriosis remain unclear. The working hypothesis of the present study was that shikonin is capable of inhibiting the development of endometriosis by inhibiting the chemotactic effect. In a murine model of endometriosis, shikonin significantly inhibited the growth of human endometrial tissue implanted into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (P<0.05) and no adverse effects were observed. Mouse regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (mRANTES) levels in the peritoneal fluid of the animal endometriosis model were higher than those in normal SCID mice (P<0.05) and decreased significantly following shikonin treatment in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Peritoneal fluid from SCID mice treated with shikonin inhibited the chemotaxis of monocytes; this inhibitory effect was eradicated by mRANTES antibody. In vitro, shikonin significantly inhibited RANTES expression in U937 cells that were cultured alone or co-cultured with human mesothelial and endometrial stromal cells. In addition, shikonin inhibited the RANTES-induced chemotaxis of U937 cells (P<0.05). The results indicate that shikonin inhibits the development of endometriosis by various mechanisms, including the inhibition of RANTES expression and the reduction of mononuclear cell migration to lesions. Therefore, shikonin may be a novel, useful and safe agent for treating endometriosis.", "Keywords": ["RANTES", "chemotaxis", "endometriosis", "shikonin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dong-Ping", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Gynecology, Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210004, P.R.

Previous studies have made great strides in the design and discovery of monophosphorylated nucleoside analogues as potential kinase-independent antiretrovirals. In this work, a series of nucleoside phosphoramidates modified by distamycin analogues was synthesized and evaluated as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-1-infected MT-4 and CEM cells, including variations in nucleoside, alkyl moiety, and the structure of distamycin analogues. These compounds exhibited modest potency with the EC50 value in the range of 1.3- to 6.5-fold lower than their corresponding parent drugs in MT-4 cells, which may be attributed to increasing intracellular availability due to the existence of distamycin analogue with favorable hydrophilic-lipophilic equilibrium. Meanwhile, the length of distamycin analogue was considered and assessed as an important factor that could affect antiviral activity and cytotoxicity. Enzymatic and metabolic stability studies have been performed in order to better understand the antiviral behavior of these compounds. The present work revealed the compounds to have a favorable and selective anti-HIV-1 activity in MT-4 and CEM cells, and helped to develop strategies for design and synthesis of effective monophosphorylated nucleoside analogues, which may be applied to antiretroviral research as NRTIs.", "Keywords": ["Anti-HIV", "Antiretrovirals", "Distamycin", "Nucleoside analogue", "ProTide"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Cell Line", "Distamycins", "HIV Reverse Transcriptase", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Nucleosides", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, PR China.

While VEGFR-1 expression is associated with poor prognosis of women with breast cancer, it is not clear whether it is involved in the aggressiveness of breast cancer. Thus, the present study examined whether VEGFR-1 activation is associated with the invasiveness of breast cancer. We reported that VEGFR-1 was detected in 60.6% of invasive breast carcinoma tissue sections. In addition, VEGFR-1 expression positively correlated with lymph node-positive tumor status, low expression level of membranous E-cadherin, and high expression levels of N-cadherin and Snail. We found that PlGF-mediated VEGFR-1 activation promoted migration and invasion in MCF-7 (luminal) cells and led to morphologic and molecular changes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This was blocked by the down-regulation of VEGFR-1. Conversely, down-regulation of VEGFR-1 in MDA-MB-231 (post-EMT) cells resulted in morphologic and molecular changes similar to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and exogenous PlGF could not reverse these changes. Moreover, VEGFR-1 activation led to an increase in nuclear translocation of Snail. Finally, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA against VEGFR-1 significantly decreased the tumor growth and metastasis capacity in a xenograft model. Histological examination of VEGFR-1/shRNA-expressing tumor xenografts showed up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of N-cadherin and Snail.

This is physiologically and psychologically troubling, since many cells show similar tuning to both classes of stimuli, and since adapting to first-order stimuli leads to aftereffects that do generalize to second-order stimuli. Focusing on high-level visual stimuli, we recently proposed the novel explanation that the lack of transfer arises partially from the characteristically different backgrounds of the two stimulus classes. Here, we consider the effect of stimulus backgrounds in the far more prevalent, lower-level, case of the orientation tilt aftereffect. Using a variety of first- and second-order oriented stimuli, we show that we could increase or decrease both within- and cross-class adaptation aftereffects by increasing or decreasing the similarity of the otherwise apparently uninteresting or irrelevant backgrounds of adapting and test patterns. Our results suggest that similarity between background statistics of the adapting and test stimuli contributes to low-level visual adaptation, and that these backgrounds are thus not discarded by visual processing but provide contextual modulation of adaptation. Null cross-adaptation aftereffects must also be interpreted cautiously. These findings reduce the apparent inconsistency between psychophysical and neurophysiological data about first- and second-order stimuli.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Figural Aftereffect", "Humans", "Illusions", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. nq6@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Dayan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Vision research", "PubDate": "2013Jul19"}, {"PMID": "23326440", "Title": "Antitumor activity of antimicrobial peptides containing CisoDGRC in CD13 negative breast cancer cells.", "Abstract": "isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) is a derivative of the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif, which is used as a targeted delivery tool to aminopeptidase N (CD13) positive cells.

However, most such models use a finite-horizon formulation, which requires a prefixed movement duration to define a cost function and solve the optimization problem. To predict movement duration, these models have to be run multiple times with different prefixed durations until an appropriate duration is found by trial and error. The constrained minimum time model directly predicts movement duration; however, it does not consider sensory feedback and is thus applicable only to open-loop movements. To address these problems, we analyzed and simulated an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model, with linear plants, that contains both control-dependent and control-independent noise and optimizes steady-state accuracy and energetic costs per unit time. The model applies the steady-state estimator and controller continuously to guide an effector to, and keep it at, target position. As such, it integrates movement control and posture maintenance without artificially dividing them with a precise, prefixed time boundary. Movement pace is determined by the model parameters, and the duration is an emergent property with trial-to-trial variability. By considering the mean duration, we derived both the log and power forms of Fitts's law as different approximations of the model. Moreover, the model reproduces typically observed velocity profiles and occasional transient overshoots. For unbiased sensory feedback, the effector reaches the target without bias, in contrast to finite-horizon models that systematically undershoot target when energetic cost is considered. Finally, the model does not involve backward and forward sweeps in time, its stability is easily checked, and the same solution applies to movements of different initial conditions and distances. We argue that biological systems could use steady-state solutions as default control mechanisms and might seek additional optimization of transient costs when justified or demanded by task or context.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Theoretical", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, and Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. nq6@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhong-Ping", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Mazzoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}]
