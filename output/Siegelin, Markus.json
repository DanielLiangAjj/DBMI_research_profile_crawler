[{"PMID": "38920655", "Title": "DPEP Inhibits Cancer Cell Glucose Uptake, Glycolysis and Survival by Upregulating Tumor Suppressor TXNIP.", "Abstract": "We have designed cell-penetrating peptides that target the leucine zipper transcription factors ATF5, CEBPB and CEBPD and that promote apoptotic death of a wide range of cancer cell types, but not normal cells, in vitro and in vivo. Though such peptides have the potential for clinical application, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Here, we show that one such peptide, Dpep, compromises glucose uptake and glycolysis in a cell context-dependent manner (in about two-thirds of cancer lines assessed). These actions are dependent on induction of tumor suppressor TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) mRNA and protein. Knockdown studies show that TXNIP significantly contributes to apoptotic death in those cancer cells in which it is induced by Dpep. The metabolic actions of Dpep on glycolysis led us to explore combinations of Dpep with clinically approved drugs metformin and atovaquone that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and that are in trials for cancer treatment. Dpep showed additive to synergistic activities in all lines tested. In summary, we find that Dpep induces TXNIP in a cell context-dependent manner that in turn suppresses glucose uptake and glycolysis and contributes to apoptotic death of a range of cancer cells.", "Keywords": ["ATF5", "CEBPB", "CEBPD", "TXNIP", "apoptosis", "apoptotic death", "cell-penetrating", "glucose uptake", "glycolysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Glycolysis", "Carrier Proteins", "Glucose", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Up-Regulation", "Apoptosis", "Neoplasms", "Peptides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang Thi Thu", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2024Jun12"}, {"PMID": "38918213", "Title": "Xenografted human iPSC-derived neurons with the familial Alzheimer's disease APPV717I mutation reveal dysregulated transcriptome signatures linked to synaptic function and implicate LINGO2 as a disease signaling mediator.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and disease mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence. These results provide important insights into transcriptional dysregulation in xenografted APPV717I neurons linked to synaptic function, and they indicate that LINGO2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Disease modeling", "Grafts", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "Transplantation", "iPSCs", "snRNA-seq"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "Animals", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Mutation", "Membrane Proteins", "Synapses", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Mares", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed A", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. vm2545@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38626772", "Title": "Osteopontin drives neuroinflammation and cell loss in MAPT-N279K frontotemporal dementia patient neurons.", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains.

In this review, the authors shed light on the diverse nature of cell-to-cell connections in brain tumours and propose an innovative treatment approach to address the detrimental connectivity of these networks. The proposed therapeutic outlook revolves around three main strategies: (a) supramarginal resection removing a substantial portion of the communicating tumour cell front far beyond the gadolinium-enhancing tumour mass, (b) morphological isolation at the single cell level disrupting structural cell-to-cell contacts facilitated by elongated cellular membrane protrusions known as tumour microtubes (TMs), and (c) functional isolation at the single cell level blocking TM-mediated intercellular cytosolic exchange and inhibiting neuronal excitatory input into the malignant network. We draw an analogy between the proposed therapeutic outlook and the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, where inmates faced an impassable sea barrier and experienced both spatial and functional isolation within individual cells.

However, past and recent evidence highlight that this approach may be limited in scope because GBM cells possess metabolic plasticity that allows them to harness other substrates, which include but are not limited to, fatty acids, amino acids, lactate, and acetate. Here, we review recent key findings in the literature that highlight that GBM cells substantially reprogram their metabolism upon therapy. These studies suggest that blocking glycolysis will yield a concomitant reactivation of oxidative energy pathways and most dominantly beta-oxidation of fatty acids.", "Keywords": ["TCA cycle", "glioblastoma", "glycolysis", "metabolism", "oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Fatty Acids", "Glioblastoma", "Glucose", "Humans", "Lactic Acid", "Oxidative Phosphorylation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Trang T T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Enyuan", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Bronx Community College, City University of New York, Bronx, NY 10453, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, 89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2022Sep22"}, {"PMID": "35997138", "Title": "Unblinding the watchmaker: cancer treatment and drug design in the face of evolutionary pressure.", "Abstract": "Death due to cancer is mostly associated with therapy ineffectiveness, i.e. tumor cells no longer responding to treatment.

In the last decade, a variety of novel molecular characteristics of GBMs were unraveled. The identification of the mutation in the IDH1 and less commonly IDH2 gene was surprising and ever since has nurtured research in the field of GBM metabolism. While initially thought that mutated IDH1 were to act as a loss of function mutation it became clear that it conferred the production of an oncometabolite that in turn substantially reprograms GBM metabolism. While mutated IDH1 represents truly the tip of the iceberg, there are numerous other related observations in GBM that are of significant interest to the field, including the notion that oxidative metabolism appears to play a more critical role than believed earlier. Metabolic zoning is another important hallmark of GBM since it was found that the infiltrative margin that drives GBM progression reveals enrichment of fatty acid derivatives. Consistently, fatty acid metabolism appears to be a novel therapeutic target for GBM. How metabolism in GBM intersects is another pivotal issue that appears to be important for its progression and response and resistance to therapies. In this review, we will summarize some of the most relevant findings related to GBM metabolism and cell death and how these observations are influencing the field.

Transcriptome analysis showed that RAB38 silencing leads to changes in genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and intrinsic apoptosis (e.g., Bcl-xL). Consistently, rescue experiments demonstrated that loss of RAB38 causes a reduction in glioblastoma viability through downregulation of Bcl-xL. Moreover, RAB38 knockdown inhibited both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Interference with RAB38 enhanced cell death induced by BH3-mimetics. RAB38 antagonists are under development, but not yet clinically available.

Although most cases of DCM are classified as sporadic, 20-30% of cases show a heritable pattern. Familial forms of DCM are genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in several genes have been identified that most commonly play a role in cytoskeleton and sarcomere-associated processes. Still, a large number of familial cases remain unsolved. Here, we report five individuals from three independent families who presented with severe dilated cardiomyopathy during the neonatal period. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified causative, compound heterozygous missense variants in RPL3L (ribosomal protein L3-like) in all the affected individuals. The identified variants co-segregated with the disease in each of the three families and were absent or very rare in the human population, in line with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. They are located within the conserved RPL3 domain of the protein and were classified as deleterious by several in silico prediction software applications. RPL3L is one of the four non-canonical riboprotein genes and it encodes the 60S ribosomal protein L3-like protein that is highly expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Three-dimensional homology modeling and in silico analysis of the affected residues in RPL3L indicate that the identified changes specifically alter the interaction of RPL3L with the RNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit and thus destabilize its binding to the 60S subunit. In conclusion, we report that bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RPL3L are causative of an early-onset, severe neonatal form of dilated cardiomyopathy, and we show for the first time that cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic cardiomyopathies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Exome", "Female", "Heart", "Humans",

Nevertheless, it is unclear exactly how IDH mutations drive glioma initiation and progression, and it is also not clear why tumors with this mutation generally have a better prognosis than IDH wild-type tumors. Recognition of the high frequency of IDH mutations in glioma [and also in other malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cholangiocarcinoma] have led to the development of a number of targeted agents that can inhibit these enzymes. Enasidenib and ivosidenib have both gained regulatory approval for IDH mutant AML.

However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor metabolism involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1\u03b1 in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacologic (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-glucose, U-13C-glutamine, and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative metabolism, which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive oxygen species. Genetic interference with PGC1\u03b1 rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that cAMP response elements binding protein regulates the expression of PGC1\u03b1 in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the antitumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity.

The depletion of survivin protein appears to be driven at least in part by enhanced proteasomal turnover and depletion of the deubiquitinase USP9X.

Several key aspects make GB a difficult to treat disease, primarily including the high resistance of tumor cells to cell death-inducing substances or radiation and the combination of the highly invasive nature of the malignancy, i.e., treatment must affect the whole brain, and the protection from drugs of the tumor bulk-or at least of the invading cells-by the blood brain barrier (BBB). TMZ crosses the BBB, but-unlike classic chemotherapeutics-does not induce DNA damage or misalignment of segregating chromosomes directly. It has been described as a DNA alkylating agent, which leads to base mismatches that initiate futile DNA repair cycles; eventually, DNA strand breaks, which in turn induces cell death.

In this case, we provide a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth by simultaneous activation of liver-X-receptors and interference with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Protein 1 (TRAP1). Informed by a transcriptomic and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis, we demonstrate that inhibition of TRAP1 results in suppression of the cholesterol synthesis pathway in stem-like and established glioblastoma (GBM) cells by destabilizing the transcription factor SREBP2. Notably, TRAP1 inhibition induced cell death, which was rescued by cholesterol and mevalonate. Activation of liver X receptor (LXR) by a clinically validated LXR agonist, LXR623, along with the TRAP1 inhibitor, gamitrinib (GTPP), results in synergistic reduction of tumor growth and cell death induction in a broad range of solid tumors, which is rescued by exogenous cholesterol. The LXR agonist and TRAP1 inhibitor mediated cell death is regulated at the level of Bcl-2 family proteins with an elevation of pro-apoptotic Noxa. Silencing of Noxa and its effector BAK attenuates cell death mediated by the combination treatment of LXR agonists and TRAP1 inhibition.

However, given that tumors become commonly resistant to single treatments, the identification of combination therapies is critical. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and XPO1 are synthetically lethal. To this purpose, two clinically validated drug compounds, the BH3-mimetic, ABT263, and the XPO1 inhibitor, Selinexor, were used in preclinical GBM model systems. Our results show that inhibition of XPO1 reduces cellular viability in glioblastoma cell cultures. Moreover, addition of ABT263 significantly enhances the efficacy of XPO1 inhibition on the reduction of cellular viability, which occurs in a synergistic manner. While selinexor inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, the combination treatment of ABT263 and selinexor results in substantial induction of cell death, which is accompanied by activation of effector- initiator caspases and cleavage of PARP. Mechanistically we find that XPO1 inhibition results in down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and attenuates ABT263 driven Mcl-1 up-regulation. Consistently, siRNA mediated silencing of Mcl-1 sensitizes for ABT263 mediated cell death and partially for the combination treatment. By using a human patient-derived xenograft model of glioblastoma in mice, we demonstrate that the combination treatment of ABT263 and Selinexor reduces tumor growth significantly more than each compound alone.

It is highly refractory to therapeutic intervention, as highlighted by the mean patient survival of only 15 months, despite an aggressive treatment approach, consisting of maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy, in particular, can have effects on the surviving fractions of tumour cells, which are considered adverse to the desired clinical outcome: It can induce increased cellular proliferation, as well as enhanced invasion. In this study, we established that differentiated glioblastoma cells alter their DNA repair response following repeated exposure to radiation and, therefore, high single-dose irradiation\u00a0(SD-IR) is not a good surrogate marker for fractionated dose irradiation\u00a0(FD-IR), as used in clinical practice. Integrating irradiation into a combination therapy approach, we then investigated whether the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling, the most abundantly activated survival cascade in glioblastoma, enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy. Of note, treatment with GDC-0941, which blocks PI3K-mediated signalling, did not enhance cell death upon irradiation, but both treatment modalities functioned synergistically to reduce the total cell number. Furthermore, GDC-0941 not only prevented the radiation-induced increase in the motility of the differentiated cells, but further reduced their speed below that of untreated cells. Therefore, combining radiotherapy with the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling is a potentially promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma, as it can reduce the unwanted effects on the surviving fraction of tumour cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA Damage", "Dose Fractionation, Radiation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Indazoles", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction", "Sulfonamides", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Hasslacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lukas", "Last Name": "Schneele", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastien", "Last Name": "Stroh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Langhans", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Zeiler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Kattner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Shaoxia", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Grunert", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, German Armed Forces Hospital of Ulm, D-89081 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Marc-Eric", "Last Name": "Halatsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Nonnenmacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Klaus-Michael", "Last Name": "Debatin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, D-89075 Ulm, Germany."}], "Journal": "International journal of oncology", "PubDate": "2018Nov"}, {"PMID": "30037819", "Title": "Metabolic Reprogramming by Dual AKT/ERK Inhibition through Imipridones Elicits Unique Vulnerabilities in Glioblastoma.", "Abstract": "Purpose: The goal of this study is to enhance the efficacy of imipridones, a novel class of AKT/ERK inhibitors that displayed limited therapeutic efficacy against glioblastoma (GBM).Experimental Design: Gene set enrichment, LC/MS, and extracellular flux analyses were used to determine the mechanism of action of novel imipridone compounds, ONC206 and ONC212. Orthotopic patient-derived xenografts were utilized to evaluate therapeutic potency.Results: Imipridones reduce the proliferation of patient-derived xenograft and stem-like glioblastoma cell cultures in vitro and in multiple xenograft models in vivo ONC212 displayed the highest potency. High levels of c-myc predict susceptibility to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by imipridones and increased host survival in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts. As early as 1 hour, imipridones elicit on-target inhibition, followed by dephosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at serine 9. GSK3\u03b2 promotes phosphorylation of c-myc at threonine 58 and enhances its proteasomal degradation. Moreover, inhibition of c-myc by BRD4 antagonists sensitizes for imipridone-induced apoptosis in stem-like GBM cells in vitro and in vivo Imipridones affect energy metabolism by suppressing both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which is accompanied by a compensatory activation of the serine-one carbon-glycine (SOG) pathway, involving the transcription factor ATF4. Interference with the SOG pathway through novel inhibitors of PHGDH results in synergistic cell death induction in vitro and in vivo Conclusions: These results suggest that c-myc expression predicts therapeutic responses to imipridones and that imipridones lead to suppression of tumor cell energy metabolism, eliciting unique metabolic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for clinical relevant drug combination therapies.

Transcriptome-based GSEA analysis suggests that metabolic reprogramming is involved with synergistic reduction of oxidative and glycolytic pathways in the combination treatment. Extracellular flux analysis confirms that combined HDAC inhibition and BRD inhibition blunts oxidative and glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells, leading to a depletion of intracellular ATP production and total ATP levels. In turn, energy deprivation drives an integrated stress response, originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in an increase in proapoptotic Noxa. Aside from Noxa, we encounter a compensatory increase of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Pharmacologic, utilizing the FDA-approved drug sorafenib, and genetic inhibition of Mcl-1 enhanced the effects of the combination therapy. Finally, we show in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts of GBM, that the combination treatment reduces tumor growth, and that triple therapy involving the clinically validated compounds panobinostat, OTX015, and sorafenib further enhances these effects, culminating in a significant regression of tumors in vivoConclusions: Overall, these results warrant clinical testing of this novel, efficacious combination therapy.

Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of Disulfiram and Carbenoxolone, that inhibit two distinct interactions between GB and the brain tissue microenvironment: stress-induced cell-matrix adhesion and gap junction mediated cell-cell communication, respectively. Increase in cell numbers of tumour-initiating cells, which are cultured in suspension as cell clusters, and adherent differentiated cells can be blocked to a similar extent by Carbenoxolone, as both cell populations form gap junctions, but the adherent differentiated cells are much more sensitive to Disulfiram treatment, which - via modulation of NF-\u03baB signalling - interferes with cell-substrate adhesion. Interestingly, inducing adhesion in tumour-initiating cells without differentiating them does not sensitize for Disulfiram.

Despite intensive research, modulation of this signalling cascade has so far yielded little therapeutic benefit, suggesting that the role of the PI3K network as a pro-survival factor in glioblastoma and therefore a potential target in combination therapy should be re-evaluated. Therefore, we used two distinct pharmacological inhibitors that block signalling at different points of the cascade, namely, GDC-0941 (Pictilisib), a direct inhibitor of the near apical PI3K, and Rapamycin which blocks the side arm of the network that is regulated by mTOR complex 1. While both substances, at concentrations where they inhibit their primary target, have similar effects on proliferation and sensitisation for temozolomide-induced apoptosis, GDC-0941 appears to have a stronger effect on cellular motility than Rapamycin. In vivo GDC-0941 effectively retards growth of orthotopic transplanted human tumours in murine brains and significantly prolongs mouse survival. However, when looking at genetically identical cell populations that are in alternative states of differentiation, i.e. stem cell-like cells and their differentiated progeny, a more complex picture regarding the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway emerges. The pathway is differently regulated in the alternative cell populations and, while it contributes to the increased chemo-resistance of stem cell-like cells compared to differentiated cells, it only contributes to the motility of the latter. Our findings are the first to suggest that within a glioblastoma tumour the PI3K network can have distinct, cell-specific functions.

Our analyses focused on BH3 mimetics that are broad acting (ABT263 and obatoclax) or selective (ABT199, WEHI-539, and A1210477), along with the established mitochondrial matrix chaperone inhibitor gamitrinib-TPP. Drug combinations were tested in various therapy-resistant tumors in vitro and in vivo in murine model systems of melanoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDX) of human glioblastoma. We found that combining BH3 mimetics and gamitrinib-TPP blunted cellular proliferation in a synergistic manner by massive activation of intrinsic apoptosis. In like manner, suppressing either Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 recapitulated the effects of BH3 mimetics and enhanced the effects of gamitrinib-TPP. Mechanistic investigations revealed that gamitrinib-TPP activated a PERK-dependent integrated stress response, which activated the proapoptotic BH3 protein Noxa and its downstream targets Usp9X and Mcl-1. Notably, in the PDX glioblastoma and BRAFi-resistant melanoma models, this drug combination safely and significantly extended host survival.

Current therapeutic strategies often focus on directly killing the dominant subclone within the population of mutated cancer cells while ignoring the subclonal complexity within the ecosystem tumor, the complexity of the direct tumor/ microenvironment interaction and the contribution of the ecosystem human - that is, the global environment which provides the tumor with both support and challenges. The Darwinian view opens new possible therapeutic interventions, such as the disruption of the microenvironment by targeting nonmutated cells within the tumor or the interaction points of mutant tumor cells with their environment, and it forces us to reevaluate therapeutic endpoints. It is our belief that a central future challenge of apoptosis-inducing therapies will be to understand better under which preconditions which treatment strategy and which therapeutic endpoint will lead to the highest quality and quantity of a patient's life.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Humans", "Mutation Accumulation", "Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Nonnenmacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Hasslacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Zimmermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, U.S.A.; Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "La Ferla-Br\u00fchl", "Affiliation": "Laboratorio Analisi Sicilia Catania, Lentini; SR, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sara E", "Last Name": "Barry", "Affiliation": "Retired, formerly: School of Built and Natural Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, Scotland."}, {"First Name": "Timo", "Last Name": "Burster", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Br\u00fchl", "Affiliation": "Laboratorio Analisi Sicilia Catania, Lentini; SR, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marc-Eric", "Last Name": "Halatsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Klaus-Michael", "Last Name": "Debatin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}], "Journal": "Critical reviews in oncogenesis", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27687793", "Title": "Bcl-xL inhibition - a novel strategy for glioma therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["ABT263", "L-asparaginase", "Usp9X", "apoptosis", "glioblastoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Aniline Compounds", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Glioma", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Signal Transduction", "Sulfonamides", "bcl-X Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Aging", "PubDate": "2016Sep28"}, {"PMID": "27172899", "Title": "Metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma cells by L-asparaginase sensitizes for apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.", "Abstract": "Cancer cells display a variety of global metabolic changes, which aside from the glycolytic pathway largely involve amino acid metabolism. To ensure aggressive growth, tumor cells highly depend on amino acids, most notably due to their pivotal need of protein synthesis. In this study, we assessed the overall hypothesis that depletion of asparagine by E. coli-derived L-asparaginase might be a novel means for the therapy of one of the most recalcitrant neoplasms and for which no efficient treatment currently exists - glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Our results suggest that certain glioma cell cultures are particularly susceptible to inhibition of proliferation by L-asparaginase, while others display a more resistant phenotype. In sensitive cells, L-asparaginase induces apoptosis with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of effector caspases. L-asparaginase-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Noxa, Mcl-1 and the deubiquitinase Usp9X. Given the impact of L-asparaginase on these molecules, we found that L-asparaginase potently overcomes resistance to both intrinsic apoptosis induced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT263, and extrinsic apoptosis mediated by TRAIL even in glioma cells that are resistant towards L-asparaginase single treatment. RNA interference studies showed that Usp9X, Mcl-1, Noxa and Bax/Bak are involved in ABT263/L-asparaginase-mediated cell death. In vivo, combined treatment with ABT263 and L-asparaginase led to an enhanced reduction of tumor growth when compared to each reagent alone without induction of toxicity.

Here, we target deubiquitinases for glioblastoma therapy by utilizing the small-molecule inhibitor WP1130 which has been characterized as a deubiquitinase inhibitor that interferes with the function of Usp9X. Expression analysis data confirm that Usp9X expression is increased in glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissue indicating its potential as a therapeutic. Consistently, increasing concentrations of WP1130 decrease the cellular viability of established, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and stem cell-like glioblastoma cells. Specific down-regulation of Usp9X reduces viability in glioblastoma cells mimicking the effects of WP1130. Mechanistically, WP1130 elicits apoptosis and increases activation of caspases. Moreover, WP1130 and siRNAs targeting Usp9X reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins, XIAP and Survivin. Pharmacological and genetic interference with Usp9X efficiently sensitized glioblastoma cells to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. In addition, single treatment with WP1130 elicited anti-glioma activity in an orthotopic proneural murine model of glioblastoma. Finally, the combination treatment of WP1130 and ABT263 inhibited tumor growth more efficiently than each reagent by its own in vivo without detectable side effects or organ toxicity.

Many targeted therapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a few disease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistant immortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are not reliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, an international task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity \"broad-spectrum\" therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspects of relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed for known effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procarcinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixed evidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of the relationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. This novel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks.

differentiated cells are believed to make up the rapidly growing tumour bulk. It is therefore important to understand the characteristics of those two distinct cell populations in order to devise treatment strategies which effectively target both cohorts, in particular with respect to cancers, such as glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumour in adults, with a mean patient survival of 12-15 months. Importantly, therapeutic improvements have not been forthcoming in the last decade. In this study we compare key features of three pairs of glioblastoma cell populations, each pair consisting of stem cell-like and differentiated cells derived from an individual patient. Our data suggest that while growth rates and expression of key survival- and apoptosis-mediating proteins are more similar according to differentiation status than genetic similarity, we found no intrinsic differences in response to standard therapeutic interventions, namely exposure to radiation or the alkylating agent temozolomide. Interestingly, we could demonstrate that both stem cell-like and differentiated cells possess the ability to form stem cell-containing tumours in immunocompromised mice and that differentiated cells could potentially be dedifferentiated to potential stem cells. Taken together our data suggest that the differences between tumour stem cell and differentiated cell are particular fluent in glioblastoma.", "Keywords": ["brain tumour", "cancer stem cell", "glioblastoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA Fragmentation", "Glioblastoma", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Mice", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Str\u00f6bele", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Nonnenmacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Tepper", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastien", "Last Name": "Stroh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Hasslacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie", "Last Name": "Enzenm\u00fcller", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gudrun", "Last Name": "Strauss", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bernd", "Last Name": "Baumann", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Klaus-Michael", "Last Name": "Debatin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Marc-Eric", "Last Name": "Halatsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany."}], "Journal": "International journal of cancer", "PubDate": "2016Apr01"}, {"PMID": "26474387", "Title": "TIC10/ONC201 synergizes with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition in glioblastoma by suppression of Mcl-1 and its binding partners in vitro and in vivo.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Current therapeutic options are sparse and the prognosis of patients suffering from this disease is grim. Abundance in intratumoral heterogeneity among different deregulated signaling pathways is a hallmark of glioblastoma and likely accounts for its recurrence and resistance to treatment. Glioblastomas harbor a plethora of deregulated pathways driving tumor formation and growth. In this study, we show that TIC10/ONC201, a promising compound that is currently in planned clinical development, along with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition by ABT263 yields a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect on pediatric, adult, proneural glioblastoma and glioma stem-like cells. On the molecular level, treatment with TIC10/ONC201 results in a posttranslational decrease of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), through modulation of the chaperone Bag3 and the deubiquitinase Usp9X. Consistently, the combination treatment of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 required the presence of functional BAX and BAK to drive intrinsic apoptosis, but is surprisingly independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the expression of Noxa protein was required for efficient apoptosis induction by TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263. Importantly, the drug combination of TIC10/ONC201 and the BH3-mimetic, ABT263, led to a regression of tumors in vivo, without any notable toxicity and side effects.

However, while in vitro data focusing mainly on established cell lines has appeared rather promising, this has not translated well to a clinical setting. In this study, we analyze the effects of the dual kinase inhibitor PI-103, which blocks PI3K and mTOR activity, on three matched pairs of GBM stem cells/differentiated cells. While blocking PI3K-mediated signaling has a profound effect on cellular proliferation, in contrast to data presented on two GBM cell lines (A172 and U87) PI-103 actually counteracts the effect of chemotherapy. While we found no indications for a potential role of the PI3K signaling cascade in differentiation, we saw a clear and strong contribution to cellular motility and, by extension, invasion.

Moreover, knock-down of Usp9X or Bag3 depleted endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels and in turn enhanced apoptosis induced through Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition. In conclusion, combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 results in a significantly enhanced anti-cancer activity in vitro as well as in vivo in the setting of glioblastoma. Both drugs, ABT263 and GX15-070 have been evaluated in clinical studies which facilitates the translational aspect of taking this combinatorial approach to the clinical setting. Furthermore we present a novel mechanism by which GX15-070 counteracts Mcl-1 expression which may lay a foundation for a novel target in cancer therapy.", "Keywords": ["ABT263", "BH3-mimetic", "GX15-070", "apoptotic resistance", "glioblastoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Brain Neoplasms", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Endopeptidases", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Molecular Structure", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Transfection", "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "bcl-X Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lily", "Last Name": "Chau", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matei", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc-Eric", "Last Name": "Halatsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yulian", "Last Name": "Ramirez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alonzo H", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2015Jun10"}, {"PMID": "25936818", "Title": "Broad targeting of resistance to apoptosis in cancer.", "Abstract": "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is natural way of removing aged cells from the body. Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However, in cancer, de-regulated apoptotic signaling, particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems, allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival, therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented.

Our initial hypothesis that olanzapine may enhance temozolomide's anti-tumor activity could be confirmed in U87MG and A172 glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover, treatment with olanzapine alone resulted in a marked anti-proliferative effect on U87MG, A172 and two glioma stem-like cells with IC50 values ranging from 25 to 79.9 \u00b5M. In U87MG cells, anchorage-independent growth was dose-dependently inhibited. In A172 cells, migration was also shown to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, olanzapine was shown to exert a cell line-dependent pleomorphism with respect to the induction of apoptosis, necrosis and/or cytostasis. Our data show that the neuroleptic olanzapine enhances the anti-tumor activity of temozolomide against glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover, this is the first study to show that olanzapine provides on its own anti-cancer activity in glioblastoma and thus may have potential for repurposing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Benzodiazepines", "Blotting, Western", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Dacarbazine", "Drug Synergism", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Olanzapine", "Phosphoproteins", "Protein Array Analysis", "Temozolomide", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081, Ulm, Germany, georg.karpel@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Richard Eric", "Last Name": "Kast", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Annika", "Last Name": "Dwucet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Welscher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Nonnenmacher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michal", "Last Name": "Hlavac", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Markus David", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian Rainer", "Last Name": "Wirtz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Klaus-Michael", "Last Name": "Debatin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marc-Eric", "Last Name": "Halatsch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "PubDate": "2015Mar"}, {"PMID": "24757258", "Title": "PI3K and Bcl-2 inhibition primes glioblastoma cells to apoptosis through downregulation of Mcl-1 and Phospho-BAD.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant human brain neoplasm with limited therapeutic options. GBMs display a deregulated apoptotic pathway with high levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and overt activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Therefore, combined interference of the PI3K pathway and the Bcl-2 family of proteins is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally available small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, and GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, were used to treat established glioblastoma and glioblastoma neurosphere cells, alone or in combination. Although GDC-0941 alone had a modest effect on cell viability, treatment with ABT-263 displayed a marked reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, combinatorial therapy using ABT-263 and GDC-0941 showed an enhanced effect, with a further decrease in cellular viability. Furthermore, combination treatment abrogated the ability of stem cell-like glioma cells to form neurospheres. ABT-263 and GDC-0941, in combination, resulted in a consistent and significant increase of Annexin V positive cells and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with either monotherapy. The combination treatment led to enhanced cleavage of both initiator and effector caspases. Mechanistically, GDC-0941 depleted pAKT (Serine 473) levels and suppressed Mcl-1 protein levels, lowering the threshold for the cytotoxic actions of ABT-263. GDC-0941 decreased Mcl-1 in a posttranslational manner and significantly decreased the half-life of Mcl-1 protein. Ectopic expression of human Mcl-1 mitigated apoptotic cell death induced by the drug combination. Furthermore, GDC-0941 modulated the phosphorylation status of BAD, thereby further enhancing ABT-263-mediated cell death.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aniline Compounds", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Down-Regulation", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Indazoles", "Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Signal Transduction", "Sulfonamides", "Transfection", "bcl-Associated Death Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fresia", "Last Name": "Pareja", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Macleod", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Crary", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Alonzo H", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and ms4169@columbia.edu ms4169@cumc.columbia.edu msiegelin@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "26056598", "Title": "A critical evaluation of PI3K inhibition in Glioblastoma and Neuroblastoma therapy.", "Abstract": "Members of the PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling cascade are among the most frequently altered proteins in cancer, yet the therapeutic application of pharmacological inhibitors of this signaling network, either as monotherapy or in combination therapy (CT) has so far not been particularly successful. In this review we will focus on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR in two distinct tumors, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an adult brain tumor which frequently exhibits PTEN inactivation, and Neuroblastoma (NB), a childhood malignancy that affects the central nervous system and does not harbor any classic alterations in PI3K/Akt signaling. We will argue that inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling can be components for potentially promising new CTs in both tumor entities, but further understanding of the signal cascade's complexity is essential for successful implementation of these CTs.

In this review, we will provide an overview of the EGFR pathway, review the significant somatic EGFR alterations in lung adenocarcinoma and highlight their implications for treatment. In addition, we will examine pathways by which tumors resist EGFR TK therapy, both as primary nonresponders and by acquired resistance.

Heat-shock-proteins have evolved as \"central regulators\" and are implicated in the modulation of these pathways and in organelle-specific signaling. In this instance, heat-shock-proteins (Hsps) assist cancer cells in the maturation of proteins. Hsp90 is of particular interest because its enzymatic ATPase activity is elevated in malignant cells as compared to non-neoplastic counterparts. Consistent with its high-activity in cancer cells, Hsp90 stabilizes a considerable number of proteins being instrumental in carcinogenesis and the maintenance and growth of highly malignant cancers. Among its distribution Hsp90 is also localized within mitochondria of neoplastic cells of various origin, interacting with another chaperone, TRAP1 (Tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor-associated protein or Heat-shock-protein 75) to antagonize the cell death promoting properties of the matrix protein, Cyclophilin-D. Several preclinical studies, including in vivo studies in both orthotopic and genetic animal models, have confirmed that targeting mitochondrial Hsp90 may be a novel efficient treatment method for highly recalcitrant tumors.
