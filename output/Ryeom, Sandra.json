[{"PMID": "38861385", "Title": "Defining the cellular origin of seminoma by transcriptional and epigenetic mapping to the normal human germline.", "Abstract": "Aberrant male germline development can lead to the formation of seminoma, a testicular germ cell tumor. Seminomas are biologically similar to primordial germ cells (PGCs) and many bear an isochromosome 12p [i(12p)] with two additional copies of the short arm of chromosome 12. By mapping seminoma transcriptomes and open chromatin landscape onto a normal human male germline trajectory, we find that seminoma resembles premigratory/migratory PGCs; however, it exhibits enhanced germline and pluripotency programs and upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, and MAPK/ERK pathways. Using pluripotent stem cell-derived PGCs from Pallister-Killian syndrome patients mosaic for i(12p), we model seminoma and identify gene dosage effects that may contribute to transformation. As murine seminoma models do not exist, our analyses provide critical insights into genetic, cellular, and signaling programs driving seminoma transformation, and the in\u00a0vitro platform developed herein permits evaluation of additional signals required for seminoma tumorigenesis.", "Keywords": ["CP: Cancer", "CP: Developmental biology", "Pallister-Killian syndrome", "human germ cell development", "human induced pluripotent stem cells", "human male germ cells", "isochromosome 12p", "primordial germ cells", "prospermatogonia", "seminoma", "testicular germ cell tumor"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Seminoma", "Male", "Germ Cells", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Testicular Neoplasms", "Transcription, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Keren", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yasunari", "Last Name": "Seita", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eoin C", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryo", "Last Name": "Yokomizo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young Sun", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonia", "Last Name": "Rotolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ian D", "Last Name": "Krantz", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, The Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3500 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jill P", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3500 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas F", "Last Name": "Kolon", "Affiliation": "Division of Urology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3500 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priti", "Last Name": "Lal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xunda", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Presbyterian Medical Center, 51 North 39th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip M", "Last Name": "Pierorazio", "Affiliation": "Division of Urology, University of Pennsylvania Presbyterian Medical Center, 3737 Market St. 4th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca L", "Last Name": "Linn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Pathology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Ryeom", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, P&S 17-409, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kotaro", "Last Name": "Sasaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, 3800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

We examined whether the stool proteome of mouse models of GC or individuals with hereditary diffuse GC (HDGC) have utility as biomarkers for early detection. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool from a genetically engineered mouse model driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 and Cdh1 in gastric parietal cells (known as TCON mice) identified differentially abundant proteins compared to littermate controls. Immunoblot assays validated a panel of proteins including actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) as enriched in TCON stool compared to littermate control stool. Immunofluorescence analysis of these proteins in TCON stomach sections revealed increased protein expression as compared to littermate controls. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool obtained from HDGC patients with CDH1 mutations identified increased expression of ASAH2, DPP4, VCP, lactotransferrin (LTF), and tropomyosin-2 (TPM2) relative to stool from healthy sex and age-matched donors. Chemical inhibition of ASAH2 using C6-urea ceramide was toxic to GC cell lines and patient derived-GC organoids. This toxicity was reversed by adding downstream products of the S1P synthesis pathway, suggesting a dependency on ASAH2 activity in GC.

In multiple GC mouse models, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids through synapse-like structures. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumor growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumor membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in nodose ganglia and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell-peptidergic neuronal circuit.

Gastric Body and Antral Epithelium.", "Abstract": "Gastric patient-derived organoids (PDOs) offer a unique tool for studying gastric biology and pathology. Consequently, these PDOs find increasing use in a wide array of research applications. However, a shortage of published approaches exists for producing gastric PDOs from single-cell digests while maintaining a standardized initial cell seeding density. In this protocol, the emphasis is on the initiation of gastric organoids from isolated single cells and the provision of a method for passaging organoids through fragmentation. Importantly, the protocol demonstrates that a standardized approach to the initial cell seeding density consistently yields gastric organoids from benign biopsy tissue and allows for standardized quantification of organoid growth. Finally, evidence supports the novel observation that gastric PDOs display varying rates of formation and growth based on whether the organoids originate from biopsies of the body or antral regions of the stomach. Specifically, it is revealed that the use of antral biopsy tissue for organoid initiation results in a greater number of organoids formed and more rapid organoid growth over a 20-day period when compared to organoids generated from biopsies of the gastric body. The protocol described herein offers investigators a timely and reproducible method for successfully generating and working with gastric PDOs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Epithelium", "Stomach", "Biopsy", "Cell Proliferation", "Organoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kole H", "Last Name": "Buckley", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Keely A", "Last Name": "Beyries", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Ryeom", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Sam S", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Bryson W", "Last Name": "Katona", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine; Bryson.Katona@pennmedicine.upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2024Jan26"}, {"PMID": "37627142", "Title": "The Present and Future of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer.", "Abstract": "Gastric cancer is a highly prevalent and lethal disease worldwide.

LAGC is typically treated with surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy. The treatment of LAGC remains a challenge, given the heterogeneity of this disease, and the optimal multimodal treatment regimen may be different for different LAGC subtypes. However, many promising treatments are on the horizon based on knowledge of molecular subtypes and key biomarkers of LAGC, such as microsatellite instability, HER2, Claudin 18.2, FGFR2, and PD-L1.

In a genetically engineered mouse model, gastric tumorigenesis was markedly attenuated when both KRAS and VEGF-A signaling were blocked. In orthotropic implant and experimental metastasis models, silencing of KRAS and VEGF-A using shRNA in gastric CSCs abrogated primary tumor formation, lymph node metastasis, and lung metastasis far greater than individual silencing of KRAS or VEGF-A. Analysis of gastric cancer patient samples using RNA sequencing revealed a clear association between high expression of the gastric CSC marker CD44 and expression of both KRAS and VEGF-A, and high CD44 and VEGF-A expression predicted worse overall survival.

The most overexpressed survival signaling-related gene in spheroids was phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3), a regulatory subunit of PI3K, which functions in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In a human sarcoma microarray, PIK3R3 was also overexpressed by 4.1-fold compared with normal tissues. PIK3R3 inhibition using shRNA in the HT1080, SK-LMS-1, and DDLS8817 dedifferentiated liposarcoma in spheroids and in CD133+ cells (a CSC marker) reduced expression of CD133 and the stem cell factor Nanog and blocked spheroid formation by 61-71%. Mechanistic studies showed that in spheroid cells, PIK3R3 activated AKT and ERK signaling. Inhibition of PIK3R3, AKT, or ERK using shRNA or inhibitors decreased expression of Nanog, spheroid formation by 68-73%, and anchorage-independent growth by 76-91%. PIK3R3 or ERK1/2 inhibition similarly blocked sarcoma spheroid cell migration, invasion, secretion of MMP-2, xenograft invasion into adjacent normal tissue, and chemotherapy resistance.

Activation of p38\u03b1 led to inactivation of type I interferon signaling and stimulation of expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP). FAP played a key role in remodeling of the extracellular matrix as well as inducing the expression of chemokines that enable lung infiltration by neutrophils. Increased activity of p38 in normal cells was associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis in human melanoma patients whereas inactivation of p38 suppressed lung metastases.

Stable expression of DSCR-1 inhibits pathological angiogenesis and septic inflammation. DSCR-1 also plays a critical role in vascular wall remodeling associated with aneurysm development that occurs primarily in smooth muscle cells. Besides, Dscr-1 deficiency promotes the M1-to M2-like phenotypic switch in macrophages, which correlates to the reduction of denatured cholesterol uptakes. However, the distinct roles of DSCR-1 in cholesterol and lipid metabolism are not well understood. Here, we show that loss of apolipoprotein (Apo) E in mice with chronic hypercholesterolemia induced Dscr-1 expression in the liver and aortic atheroma. In Dscr-1-null mice fed a high-fat diet, oxidative- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was induced, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2 production in hepatocytes was stimulated. This exaggerated ApoE-/--mediated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subsequent hypercholesterolemia. Genome-wide screening revealed that loss of both ApoE and Dscr-1 resulted in the induction of immune- and leukocyte activation-related genes in the liver compared with ApoE deficiency alone. However, expressions of inflammation-activated markers and levels of monocyte adhesion were suspended upon induction of the Dscr-1 null background in the aortic endothelium. Collectively, our study shows that the combined loss of Dscr-1 and ApoE causes metabolic dysfunction in the liver but reduces atherosclerotic plaques, thereby leading to a dramatic increase in serum cholesterol and the formation of sporadic vasculopathy.", "Keywords": ["Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)-1", "apolipoprotein (Apo)E", "hypercholesterolemia", "low-density lipoprotein (LDL)", "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)", "nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT)", "proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK)9", "regulator of calcineurin (RCAN)1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apolipoproteins E", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Cholesterol", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hepatocytes", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Mice", "Muscle Proteins", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Muramatsu", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular and Vascular Biology, IRDA, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tsuyoshi", "Last Name": "Osawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Integrative Nutriomics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuri", "Last Name": "Miyamura", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular and Vascular Biology, IRDA, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Suguru", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Genome Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Toshiya", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Biology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tatsuhiko", "Last Name": "Kodama", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Biology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroyuki", "Last Name": "Aburatani", "Affiliation": "Division of Genome Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Juro", "Last Name": "Sakai", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolic Medicine, RCAST, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Molecular Physiology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Ryeom", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Minami", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular and Vascular Biology, IRDA, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.

Toward novel therapeutic strategies that target or evade these phenomena, we evaluated the function of the transcriptional regulator transducin (\u03b2)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) in GC cells, including stem-like cells. In this study, the correlation of expression of TBL1XR1 and clinical features and GC patients' outcomes was evaluated. Knockdown or exogenous expression of TBL1XR1 was combined with in vitro (2D and 3D cultures) and in vivo (mouse lung and lymphatic metastasis models) assays to evaluate the function of TBL1XR1. TBL1XR1's downstream signaling was delineated by phospho-kinase array and knockdown of candidate mediators. Analysis of clinical data showed that TBL1XR1 overexpression was correlated with worse prognosis. Functional assays showed that TBL1XR1 promoted stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and lung and lymphatic metastasis in GC cells. TBL1XR1 activated ERK1/2-Sox2 signaling and was dependent on signaling via PI3K/AKT, in GC stem-like cells distinguished by CD44 expression.

A role for DSCR-1 in different organ microenvironment such as the cornea and its role in ocular diseases is not well understood. Corneal changes can be indicators of various disease states and are easily detected through ocular examinations. Approach and Results: The presentation of a corneal arcus or a corneal opacity due to lipid deposition in the cornea often indicates hyperlipidemia and in most cases, hypercholesterolemia. Although the loss of Apo (apolipoprotein) E has been well characterized and is known to lead to elevated serum cholesterol levels, there are few corneal changes observed in ApoE-/- mice. In this study, we show that the combined loss of ApoE and DSCR-1 leads to a dramatic increase in serum cholesterol levels and severe corneal opacity with complete penetrance. The cornea is normally maintained in an avascular state; however, loss of Dscr-1 is sufficient to induce hyper-inflammatory and -oxidative condition, increased corneal neovascularization, and lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, immunohistological analysis and genome-wide screening revealed that loss of Dscr-1 in mice triggers increased immune cell infiltration and upregulation of SDF (stromal derived factor)-1 and its receptor, CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand receptor-4), potentiating this signaling axis in the cornea, thereby contributing to pathological corneal angiogenesis and opacity.", "Keywords":

Kras (a.k.a. Tcon mice) accelerates tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we sought to examine KRAS activation in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and generation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Transduction of nontransformed HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells with oncogenic KRASG12V significantly decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the EMT transcription factor Slug, and increased migration and invasion by 15- to 17-fold. KRASG12V also increased expression of self-renewal proteins such as Sox2 and increased spheroid formation by 2.6-fold. In tumor-derived organoids from Tcon mice, Kras knockdown decreased spheroid formation, expression of EMT-related proteins, migration, and invasion; similar effects, as well as reversal of chemoresistance, were observed following KRAS knockdown or MEK inhibition in patient tumor-derived gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines (AGS and KATOIII). KRAS inhibition in gastric adenocarcinoma spheroid cells led to reduced AGS flank xenograft growth, loss of the infiltrative tumor border, fewer lung metastases, and increased survival. In a tissue microarray of human gastric adenocarcinomas from 115 patients, high tumor levels of CD44 (a marker of CSCs) and KRAS activation were independent predictors of worse overall survival. In conclusion, KRAS activation in gastric adenocarcinoma cells stimulates EMT and transition to CSCs, thus promoting metastasis.

Activated fibroblasts remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) in primary tumor and metastatic microenvironments, exerting both pro- and antitumorigenic effects. However, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate the activation of fibroblasts are not well-defined. The signaling axis comprising the calcium-activated Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CN), and its downstream target nuclear factor of activated T cells, has been implicated in endothelial (EC) and immune cell activation, but its role in fibroblasts is not known. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of CN in fibroblasts in vitro altered fibroblast morphology and function consistent with an activated phenotype relative to wild-type fibroblasts. CN-null fibroblasts had a greater migratory capacity, increased collagen secretion and remodeling, and promoted more robust EC activation in vitro. ECM generated by CN-null fibroblasts contained more collagen with greater alignment of fibrillar collagen compared with wild-type fibroblast-derived matrix. These differences in matrix composition and organization imposed distinct changes in morphology and cytoskeletal architecture of both fibroblasts and tumor cells. Consistent with this in vitro phenotype, mice with stromal CN deletion had a greater incidence and larger lung metastases. Our data suggest that CN signaling contributes to the maintenance of fibroblast homeostasis and that loss of CN is sufficient to promote fibroblast activation.

Here we report the development of a genetically engineered mouse model of gastric adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis based on KrasG12D expression plus inactivation of E-cadherin (Cdh1) and p53 in the gastric parietal cell lineage. Intestinal and diffuse gastric tumors arise rapidly in this model that displays a median survival of 76 days. Tumors occur throughout the stomach, with metastases documented in lymph nodes, lung, and liver. Mice otherwise identical but retaining one wild-type Cdh1 allele exhibited longer survival with only 20% penetrance of invasive tumors and no apparent lung or liver metastases.

Therefore, Rac1 activity and inhibition were examined in gastric adenocarcinoma cells and mouse xenograft models for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSC phenotypes. Rac1 activity was significantly higher in spheroid-forming or CD44+ gastric adenocarcinoma CSCs compared with unselected cells. Rac1 inhibition using Rac1 shRNA or a Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) decreased expression of the self-renewal transcription factor, Sox-2, decreased spheroid formation by 78%-81%, and prevented tumor initiation in immunodeficient mice. Gastric adenocarcinoma CSCs had increased expression of the EMT transcription factor Slug, 4.4- to 8.3-fold greater migration, and 4.2- to 12.6-fold greater invasion than unselected cells, and these increases could be blocked completely with Rac1 inhibition. Gastric adenocarcinoma spheroid cells were resistant to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin chemotherapy, and this chemotherapy resistance could be reversed with Rac1 shRNA or NSC23766. The PI3K/Akt pathway may be upstream of Rac1, and JNK may be downstream of Rac1. In the MKN-45 xenograft model, cisplatin inhibited tumor growth by 50%, Rac1 inhibition by 35%, and the combination by 77%. Higher Rac1 activity, in clinical specimens from gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent potentially curative surgery, correlated with significantly worse survival (P = 0.017). In conclusion, Rac1 promotes the EMT program in gastric adenocarcinoma and the acquisition of a CSC state. Rac1 inhibition in gastric adenocarcinoma cells blocks EMT and CSC phenotypes, and thus may prevent metastasis and augment chemotherapy.Implications: In gastric adenocarcinoma, therapeutic targeting of the Rac1 pathway may prevent or reverse EMT and CSC phenotypes that drive tumor progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance.

OIS has been suggested to function as a cancer cell intrinsic mechanism to restrain tumor growth and has been implicated as a key mechanism preventing the progression of certain premalignant lesions in genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. The senescent phenotype can be defined by two criteria that include cell cycle arrest and resistance to mitogens and oncogenic transformation. While the phenotype and properties of senescent cells in vitro are well described, the morphological characteristics defining senescence in vivo have been controversial with no specific marker that definitively proves a senescent state. Indeed, many of the published in vivo markers to identify and characterize senescence in an organism are unreliable and often times have been found to be nonspecific. However, the use of multiple markers is accepted as confirmation of senescence in vivo. Here, we describe protocols for some of the most commonly used indicators of senescence in oncogenic Kras-induced lung adenomas including the detection of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, expression of the tumor suppressor p19ARF, the presence of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, and in vivo BrdU uptake to confirm cell cycle arrest.", "Keywords": ["Adenomas", "BrdU", "Oncogene-induced senescence", "Ras", "SA-beta galactosidase", "Senescence", "Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci", "p19ARF"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cellular Senescence", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16", "Disease Progression", "Heterochromatin", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Oncogene Protein p21(ras)", "Oncogenes", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "beta-Galactosidase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kwan-Hyuck", "Last Name": "Baek", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Gyeonggi, 440-746, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Ryeom", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Room 752 BRB II/III, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. sryeom@upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27589843", "Title": "Tumor vessel normalization after aerobic exercise enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy.", "Abstract": "Targeted therapies aimed at tumor vasculature are utilized in combination with chemotherapy to improve drug delivery and efficacy after tumor vascular normalization. Tumor vessels are highly disorganized with disrupted blood flow impeding drug delivery to cancer cells. Although pharmacologic anti-angiogenic therapy can remodel and normalize tumor vessels, there is a limited window of efficacy and these drugs are associated with severe side effects necessitating alternatives for vascular normalization. Recently, moderate aerobic exercise has been shown to induce vascular normalization in mouse models. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the tumor vascular normalization induced by exercise. Shear stress, the mechanical stimuli exerted on endothelial cells by blood flow, modulates vascular integrity. Increasing vascular shear stress through aerobic exercise can alter and remodel blood vessels in normal tissues. Our data in mouse models indicate that activation of calcineurin-NFAT-TSP1 signaling in endothelial cells plays a critical role in exercise-induced shear stress mediated tumor vessel remodeling.

Activation of the GCN2 arm of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in response to amino acid deprivation is one mechanism by which tumor cells cope with nutrient stress. GCN2 phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, leading to global downregulation of translation to conserve amino acids and initiation of a transcriptional program through ATF4 to promote recovery from nutrient deprivation. Loss of GCN2 results in decreased tumor cell survival in vitro under amino acid deprivation and attenuated tumor growth in xenograft tumor models. However, it is not known what effects GCN2 loss has on the growth of autochthonous tumors that arise in their native microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate in a genetically engineered mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma that loss of GCN2 has no effect on tumor growth or animal survival. The sarcomas displayed compensatory activation of PERK or phospho-eIF2\u03b1 independent upregulation of ATF4 in order to maintain ISR signaling, indicating that this pathway is critical for tumorigenesis.

To explore the hypothesis that low-dose exposures to mixtures of chemicals in the environment may be combining to contribute to environmental carcinogenesis, we reviewed 11 hallmark phenotypes of cancer, multiple priority target sites for disruption in each area and prototypical chemical disruptors for all targets, this included dose-response characterizations, evidence of low-dose effects and cross-hallmark effects for all targets and chemicals. In total, 85 examples of chemicals were reviewed for actions on key pathways/mechanisms related to carcinogenesis. Only 15% (13/85) were found to have evidence of a dose-response threshold, whereas 59% (50/85) exerted low-dose effects. No dose-response information was found for the remaining 26% (22/85). Our analysis suggests that the cumulative effects of individual (non-carcinogenic) chemicals acting on different pathways, and a variety of related systems, organs, tissues and cells could plausibly conspire to produce carcinogenic synergies. Additional basic research on carcinogenesis and research focused on low-dose effects of chemical mixtures needs to be rigorously pursued before the merits of this hypothesis can be further advanced.

To study possible carcinogens, the fields of endocrinology, genetics, epigenetics, medicine, environmental health, toxicology, pharmacology and oncology must be considered. Disruptive chemicals may also contribute to multiple stages of tumor development through effects on the tumor microenvironment. In turn, the tumor microenvironment consists of a complex interaction among blood vessels that feed the tumor, the extracellular matrix that provides structural and biochemical support, signaling molecules that send messages and soluble factors such as cytokines. The tumor microenvironment also consists of many host cellular effectors including multipotent stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cell precursors, antigen-presenting cells, lymphocytes and innate immune cells. Carcinogens can influence the tumor microenvironment through effects on epithelial cells, the most common origin of cancer, as well as on stromal cells, extracellular matrix components and immune cells. Here, we review how environmental exposures can perturb the tumor microenvironment. We suggest a role for disrupting chemicals such as nickel chloride, Bisphenol A, butyltins, methylmercury and paraquat as well as more traditional carcinogens, such as radiation, and pharmaceuticals, such as diabetes medications, in the disruption of the tumor microenvironment. Further studies interrogating the role of chemicals and their mixtures in dose-dependent effects on the tumor microenvironment could have important general mechanistic implications for the etiology and prevention of tumorigenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Environmental Exposure", "Hazardous Substances", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"],

These transcripts produce identical proteins but differ in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although several stresses that induce p21 have been characterized, the mechanisms regulating the individual transcript variants and their functional significance are unknown. Here we demonstrate through (35)S labeling, luciferase reporter assays, and polysome transcript profiling that activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) kinase GCN2 selectively upregulates the translation of a p21 transcript variant containing 5' upstream open reading frames (uORFs) through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. Mutational analysis reveals that the uORFs suppress translation under basal conditions, but promote translation under stress. Functionally, ablation of p21 ameliorates G1/S arrest and reduces cell survival in response to GCN2 activation. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of p21 post-transcriptional regulation, offer functional significance for the existence of multiple p21 transcripts, and support a key role for GCN2 in regulating the cell cycle under stress.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21", "Food", "Humans", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Stress, Physiological", "Up-Regulation", "eIF-2 Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stacey L", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "George J", "Last Name": "Cerniglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gregg J", "Last Name": "Johannes", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jiangbin", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Ryeom", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Constantinos", "Last Name": "Koumenis", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25009293", "Title": "Cyclosporin A promotes tumor angiogenesis in a calcineurin-independent manner by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.", "Abstract": "The widely used immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, significantly increases the incidence of cancer in organ transplant patients. Calcineurin signaling is an important mediator of VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. Negative regulation of calcineurin by its endogenous inhibitor, Down Syndrome Candidate Region-1 (DSCR1), suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis, in contrast to the effect observed after long-term cyclosporin A treatment. Despite the significance of calcineurin signaling in endothelial cells, the consequences of cyclosporin A on tumor angiogenesis have not been investigated. Using an in vivo model of skin carcinogenesis, prolonged treatment with cyclosporin A promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis. The addition of cyclosporin A to endothelial cells in vitro increased proliferation and migration in a calcineurin-independent manner and is associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Co-treatment with antioxidants significantly abrogated cyclosporin A-induced endothelial cell activation. Furthermore, mice treated with antioxidants were protected against cyclosporin A-mediated tumor progression. Taken together, these findings suggest that cyclosporin A affects endothelial cells in a calcineurin-independent manner to potentiate tumor growth by promoting tumor angiogenesis through increasing mitochondrial ROS production.

DOX-treated animals had less gain in body weight, reduced heart weights (HW), smaller HW-to-body weight ratios, and shorter tibial lengths by the end of the protocol; and exercise did not reverse the cardiotoxic effects of DOX. Despite decreased left ventricular (LV) mass with DOX, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain gene expression, and whole heart systolic (fractional shortening) and diastolic (E/A ratio) function were similar among groups. DOX also resulted in increased LV fibrosis with lower LV end diastolic volume and stroke volume.
