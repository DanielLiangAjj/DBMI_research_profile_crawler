Suicidal behavior has a complex etiology and pathogenesis. Moderate heritability suggests genetic causes. Associations between childhood and recent life adversity indicate contributions from epigenetic factors. Genomic contributions to suicide pathogenesis remain largely unknown. This paper is based on a workshop held to design strategies to identify molecular drivers of suicide neurobiology that would be putative new treatment targets. The panel determined that, while bulk tissue studies provide comprehensive information, single-nucleus approaches identifying cell-type specific changes are needed. While single nuclei techniques lack information on cytoplasm, processes, spines, and synapses, spatial multiomic technologies on intact tissue detect cell alterations specific to brain tissue layers and subregions. Because suicide has genetic and environmental drivers, multiomic approaches combining cell-type specific epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome provide a more complete picture of pathogenesis. To determine the direction of effect of suicide risk gene variants on RNA and protein expression, and how these interact with epigenetic marks, single nuclei and spatial multiomics quantitative trait loci maps should be integrated with whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association databases. The workshop concluded with the recommendation for the formation of an international suicide biology consortium that will bring together brain banks and investigators with expertise in cutting-edge omics technologies to delineate the biology of suicide and identify novel potential treatment targets to be tested in cellular and animal models for drug and biomarkers discovery, to guide suicide prevention.", "Keywords": ["Multiomics", "human brain", "postmortem", "suicide"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY; Division of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY.

Although the ability of thousands of SNPs (especially rare ones) to identify individuals has been repeatedly shown, the availability of small sets of noisy genotypes, from environmental DNA samples or functional genomics data, motivated us to quantify their informativeness. We present a computational tool suite, termed Privacy Leakage by Inference across Genotypic HMM Trajectories (PLIGHT), using population-genetics-based hidden Markov models (HMMs) of recombination and mutation to find piecewise alignment of small, noisy SNP sets to reference haplotype databases. We explore cases in which query individuals are either known to be in the database, or not, and consider several genotype queries, including those from environmental sample swabs from known individuals and from simulated \"mosaics\" (two-individual composites). Using PLIGHT on a database with \u223c5000 haplotypes, we find for common, noise-free SNPs that only ten are sufficient to identify individuals, \u223c20 can identify both components in two-individual mosaics, and 20-30 can identify first-order relatives. Using noisy environmental-sample-derived SNPs, PLIGHT identifies individuals in a database using \u223c30 SNPs. Even when the individuals are not in the database, local genotype matches allow for some phenotypic information leakage based on coarse-grained SNP imputation. Finally, by quantifying privacy leakage from sparse SNP sets, PLIGHT helps determine the value of selectively sanitizing released SNPs without explicit assumptions about population membership or allele frequency. To make this practical, we provide a sanitization tool to remove the most identifying SNPs from genomic data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prashant S", "Last Name": "Emani", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maya N", "Last Name": "Geradi", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gamze", "Last Name": "G\u00fcrsoy", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monica R", "Last Name": "Grasty", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Miranker", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark B", "Last Name": "Gerstein", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA; mark@gersteinlab.org."}], "Journal": "Genome research", "PubDate": "2023Dec14"}, {"PMID": "37001506", "Title": "The EN-TEx resource of multi-tissue personal epigenomes\u00a0& variant-impact models.", "Abstract": "Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid reference genome.

However, analysis and maintenance of high volume of genetic mutation data to build a machine learning (ML) model to predict the cancer type is a computationally expensive task and is often outsourced to powerful cloud servers, raising critical privacy concerns for patients' data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data, thus, providing cryptographic guarantees to protect privacy. But restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this work, we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer type prediction using a dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic mutations from 2713 patients for several cancer types by building a highly accurate ML model and then implementing its privacy preserving version in HE. Our solution for cancer type inference encodes somatic mutations based on their impact on the cancer genomes into the feature space and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. We propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for HE-based model. Our final model achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve improving accuracy from 70.08 to 83.61% , being 550 times faster than the standard matrix multiplication-based privacy-preserving models.

However, repeat expansions are often not explored beyond neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In some cancers, mutations accumulate in short tracts of TRs, a phenomenon termed microsatellite instability; however, larger repeat expansions have not been systematically analysed in cancer3-8. Here we identified TR expansions in 2,622 cancer genomes spanning 29 cancer types. In seven cancer types, we found 160 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs), most of which (155/160) were subtype specific. We found that rREs were non-uniformly distributed in the genome with enrichment near candidate cis-regulatory elements, suggesting a potential role in gene regulation. One rRE, a GAAA-repeat expansion, located near a regulatory element in the first intron of UGT2B7 was detected in 34% of renal cell carcinoma samples and was validated by long-read DNA sequencing. Moreover, in preliminary experiments, treating cells that harbour this rRE with a GAAA-targeting molecule led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. Overall, our results suggest that rREs may be an important but unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancer, and we provide a comprehensive catalogue for further study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Base Sequence", "DNA Repeat Expansion", "Genome, Human", "Neoplasms", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Introns", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Cell Proliferation", "Reproducibility of Results"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Graham S", "Last Name": "Erwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. gerwin@stanford.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gamze", "Last Name": "G\u00fcrsoy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rashid", "Last Name": "Al-Abri", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashwini", "Last Name": "Suriyaprakash", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Egor", "Last Name": "Dolzhenko", "Affiliation": "Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian R", "Last Name": "Hoerner", "Affiliation": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shannon M", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucia", "Last Name": "Ramirez", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ananya", "Last Name": "Vadlakonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alekhya", "Last Name": "Vadlakonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Konor", "Last Name": "von Kraut", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charlotte M", "Last Name": "Brannon", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Sumano", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raushun A", "Last Name": "Kirtikar", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alicia A", "Last Name": "Erwin", "Affiliation": "Data Science Program, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Metzner", "Affiliation": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan K C", "Last Name": "Yuen", "Affiliation": "Genetics and Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Alice C", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John T", "Last Name": "Leppert", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Eberle", "Affiliation": "Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Gerstein", "Affiliation": "Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. mark@gersteinlab.org."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Snyder", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. mpsnyder@stanford.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2023Jan"}, {"PMID": "36086138", "Title": "Privacy-preserving Model Training for Disease Prediction Using Federated Learning with Differential Privacy.", "Abstract": "Machine learning is playing an increasingly critical role in health science with its capability of inferring valuable information from high-dimensional data.

diseases. However, genotyping whole genomes from a large cohort of individuals is still cost prohibitive. Imputation methods to predict genotypes of missing genetic variants are widely used, especially for genome-wide association studies. Accurate genotype imputation requires complex statistical methods. Due to the data and computing-intensive nature of the problem, imputation is increasingly outsourced, raising serious privacy concerns. In this work, we investigate solutions for fast, scalable, and accurate privacy-preserving genotype imputation using Machine Learning (ML) and a standardized homomorphic encryption scheme, Paillier cryptosystem. ML-based privacy-preserving inference has been largely optimized for computation-heavy non-linear functions in a single-output multi-class classification setting. However, having a large number of multi-class outputs per genome per individual calls for further optimizations and/or approximations specific to this application. Here we explore the effectiveness of linear models for genotype imputation to convert them to privacy-preserving equivalents using standardized homomorphic encryption schemes. Our results show that performance of our privacy-preserving genotype imputation method is equivalent to the state-of-the-art plaintext solutions, achieving up to 99% micro area under curve score, even on real-world large-scale datasets up to 80,000 targets.", "Keywords": ["Genotype imputation", "machine learning", "privacy-preserving computation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Esha", "Last Name": "Sarkar", "Affiliation": "Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, New York, NY 11201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eduardo", "Last Name": "Chielle", "Affiliation": "New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."}, {"First Name": "Gamze", "Last Name": "G\u00fcrsoy", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oleg", "Last Name": "Mazonka", "Affiliation": "New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Gerstein", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michail", "Last Name": "Maniatakos", "Affiliation": "Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, New York, NY 11201, USA."}], "Journal": "IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34468950", "Title": "Establishing a Global Standard for Wearable Devices in Sport and Exercise Medicine: Perspectives from Academic and Industry Stakeholders.", "Abstract": "Millions of consumer sport and fitness wearables (CSFWs) are used worldwide, and millions of datapoints are generated by each device.

To address this growing need, we convened a virtual panel of industry and academic stakeholders, and this manuscript summarizes the outcomes of the discussion. Our objectives were to identify (1) key facilitators of and barriers to participation by CSFW manufacturers in guiding standards and (2) stakeholder priorities. The venues were the Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science Digital Health Monthly Seminar Series (62 participants) and the New England Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting (59 participants). In the discussion, stakeholders outlined both facilitators of (e.g., commercial return on investment in device quality, lucrative research partnerships, and transparent and multilevel evaluation of device quality) and barriers (e.g., competitive advantage conflict, lack of flexibility in previously developed devices) to participation in guiding standards. There was general agreement to adopt Keadle et al.'s standard pathway for testing devices (i.e., benchtop, laboratory, field-based, implementation) without consensus on the prioritization of these steps. Overall, there was enthusiasm not to add prescriptive or regulatory steps, but instead create a networking hub that connects companies to consumers and researchers for flexible guidance navigating the

Our protocol works with traditional Illumina-based assays and newer technologies such as 10x single-cell RNA sequencing. It involves quantifying the privacy leakage in reads by statistically linking study participants to known individuals.

However, for particular applications, it may be advantageous to use a customized annotation. Here, we develop such a custom annotation by leveraging advanced assays, such as eCLIP, Hi-C, and whole-genome STARR-seq on a number of data-rich ENCODE cell types. A key aspect of this annotation is comprehensive and experimentally derived networks of both transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins (TFs and RBPs). Cancer, a disease of system-wide dysregulation, is an ideal application for such a network-based annotation. Specifically, for cancer-associated cell types, we put regulators into hierarchies and measure their network change (rewiring) during oncogenesis. We also extensively survey TF-RBP crosstalk, highlighting how SUB1, a previously uncharacterized RBP, drives aberrant tumor expression and amplifies the effect of MYC, a well-known oncogenic TF. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows us to place oncogenic transformations in the context of a broad cell space; here, many normal-to-tumor transitions move towards a stem-like state, while oncogene knockdowns show an opposing trend. Finally, we organize the resource into a coherent workflow to prioritize key elements and variants, in addition to regulators. We showcase the application of this prioritization to somatic burdening, cancer differential expression and GWAS. Targeted validations of the prioritized regulators, elements and variants using siRNA knockdowns, CRISPR-based editing, and luciferase assays demonstrate the value of the ENCODE resource.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Databases, Genetic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Genomics", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donghoon", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Program in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vineet", "Last Name": "Dhiman", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard T.H.

The interaction pattern of budding yeast as measured from genome-wide 3C studies are largely recapitulated by model polymer genomes subject to landmark constraints. However, the origin of inter-chromosomal interactions, specific roles of individual landmarks, and the roles of biochemical factors in yeast genome organization remain unclear. Here we describe a multi-chromosome constrained self-avoiding chromatin model (mC-SAC) to gain understanding of the budding yeast genome organization. With significantly improved sampling of genome structures, both intra- and inter-chromosomal interaction patterns from genome-wide 3C studies are accurately captured in our model at higher resolution than previous studies. We show that nuclear confinement is a key determinant of the intra-chromosomal interactions, and centromere tethering is responsible for the inter-chromosomal interactions. In addition, important genomic elements such as fragile sites and tRNA genes are found to be clustered spatially, largely due to centromere tethering. We uncovered previously unknown interactions that were not captured by genome-wide 3C studies, which are found to be enriched with tRNA genes, RNAPIII and TFIIS binding. Moreover, we identified specific high-frequency genome-wide 3C interactions that are unaccounted for by polymer effects under landmark constraints.

Studies based on Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) has shown that a basic reaction system can display stochastic focusing (SF) by increasing the sensitivity of the network as a result of the signal noise. Although SSA has been widely used to study stochastic networks, it is ineffective in examining rare events and this becomes a significant issue when the tails of probability distributions are relevant as is the case of SF. Here we use the ACME method to solve the exact solution of the discrete Chemical Master Equations and to study a network where SF was reported. We showed that the level of SF depends on the degree of the fluctuations of signal molecule. We discovered that signaling noise under certain conditions in the same reaction network can lead to a decrease in the system sensitivities, thus the network can experience stochastic defocusing. These results highlight the fundamental role of stochasticity in biological reaction networks and the need for exact computation of probability landscape of the molecules in the system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Computer Simulation", "Models, Biological", "Probability", "Stochastic Processes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gamze", "Last Name": "Gursoy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Terebus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Youfang Cao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Jie Liang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Although VILI severity is attenuated by reduced NAMPT/PBEF bioavailability, the precise contribution of NAMPT/PBEF and excessive mechanical stress to VILI pathobiology is unknown. We now report that NAMPT/PBEF induces lung NF\u03baB transcriptional activities and inflammatory injury via direct ligation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Computational analysis demonstrated that NAMPT/PBEF and MD-2, a TLR4-binding protein essential for LPS-induced TLR4 activation, share ~30% sequence identity and exhibit striking structural similarity in loop regions critical for MD-2-TLR4 binding. Unlike MD-2, whose TLR4 binding alone is insufficient to initiate TLR4 signaling, NAMPT/PBEF alone produces robust TLR4 activation, likely via a protruding region of NAMPT/PBEF (S402-N412) with structural similarity to LPS. The identification of this unique mode of TLR4 activation by NAMPT/PBEF advances the understanding of innate immunity responses as well as the untoward events associated with mechanical stress-induced lung inflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Chemical", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "NF-kappa B", "Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase", "Pneumonia", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Toll-Like Receptor 4", "Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sara M", "Last Name": "Camp", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Ermelinda", "Last Name": "Ceco", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Evenoski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Sergei M", "Last Name": "Danilov", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Eddie T", "Last Name": "Chiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Liliana", "Last Name": "Moreno-Vinasco", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Mapes", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Jieling", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Gamze", "Last Name": "Gursoy", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Djanybek M", "Last Name": "Adyshev", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Shahid S", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Hector", "Last Name": "Quijada", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Saad", "Last Name": "Sammani", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Eleftheria", "Last Name": "Letsiou", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Laleh", "Last Name": "Saadat", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Respiratory Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "Yousef", "Affiliation": "Life Science Group, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc."}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Joe G N", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Arizona Respiratory Center, The University of Arizona."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2015Aug14"}, {"PMID": "25570855", "Title": "Computational predictions of structures of multichromosomes of budding yeast.", "Abstract": "Knowledge of the global architecture of the cell nucleus and the spatial organization of genome is critical for understanding gene expression and nuclear function.

There is a multitude of mechanisms controlling cellular epigenetic states and that dictate the behavior of cells. Among these, networks of interacting molecules, often under stochastic control, depending on the specific wirings of molecular components and the physiological conditions, can have a different landscape of cellular states. In addition, chromosome folding in three-dimensional space provides another important control mechanism for selective activation and repression of gene expression. Fully differentiated cells with different properties grow, divide, and interact through mechanical forces and communicate through signal transduction, resulting in the formation of complex tissue patterns.

We studied large ensembles of model chromatin chains with appropriate fiber diameter, persistence length and excluded volume under spatial confinement. We show that the equilibrium ensemble of randomly folded chromosomes in the confined nuclear volume gives rise to the experimentally observed higher-order architecture of human chromosomes, including average scaling properties of mean-square spatial distance, end-to-end distance, contact probability and their chromosome-to-chromosome variabilities.
