In addition, they provide the proliferative burst of effector CD8 T cells after programmed death protein 1 (PD-1)-directed immunotherapy. However, it is not known whether checkpoint blockade diminishes the number of these stem-like progenitor cells as effector cell differentiation increases. To investigate this, we used the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Treatment of chronically infected mice with either \u03b1PD-1 or \u03b1PD-L1 antibody not only increased effector cell differentiation from the virus-specific stem-like CD8 T cells but also increased their proliferation so their numbers were maintained. The increased self-renewal of LCMV-specific stem-like CD8 T cells was mTOR dependent. We used microscopy to understand the division of these progenitor cells and found that after PD-1 blockade, an individual dividing cell could give rise to a differentiated TCF-1- daughter cell alongside a self-renewing TCF-1+ sister cell. This asymmetric division helped to preserve the number of stem-like cells. Moreover, we found that the PD-1+TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells retained their transcriptional program and their in vivo functionality in terms of responding to viral infection and to repeat PD-1 blockade.

We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells.

Mice challenged with syngeneic tumors were treated with anti-PD-1 and/or a reversible inhibitor of PI3K \u03b4, designed to promote T cell self-renewal.

Higher proportions of TCF1+ T cells in tumor and blood correlated with better control of tumor growth. Combining anti-PD-1 and inhibitor of PI3K \u03b4 conferred superior protection compared with either monotherapy and was associated with higher frequency of TCF1+ T cells in tumor and blood compared with anti-PD-1 alone.

These cells were a quantitatively minor subpopulation of the TCF-1+ pool and exhibited self-renewal, heightened DNA damage surveillance activity, and preferential long-term recall capacity. Despite features of memory and somewhat restrained proliferation during the expansion phase, this subset displayed evidence of stronger TCR signaling than other responding CD8+ T cells, coupled with elevated expression of multiple inhibitory receptors including programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), CD5, and CD160.

Compared with efflux(-) TRMs, efflux(+) TRMs showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling in response to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, upon activation, efflux(+) TRMs secreted lower levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 and underwent reduced degranulation. Interestingly, analysis of TRM subsets following activation revealed that both efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRMs undergo extensive transcriptional changes following TCR ligation but retain core TRM transcriptional properties including retention markers, suggesting that TRMs carry out effector function in situ.

Dual costimulation with anti-CD134 plus anti-CD137 is particularly potent because it programs cytotoxic potential in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Cytotoxicity in dual-costimulated CD4 T cells depends on the T-box transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes), which we report is induced via a mechanism that does not rely on IL-2, in contrast to CD8+ CTL, but rather depends on the CD8 T cell lineage commitment transcription factor Runx3, which supports Eomes expression in mature CD8+ CTLs. Further, Eomes and Runx3 were indispensable for dual-costimulated CD4 T cells to mediate antitumor activity in an aggressive melanoma model. Runx3 is also known to be expressed in standard CD4 Th1 cells where it fosters IFN-\u03b3 expression; however, the CD4 T cell lineage commitment factor ThPOK represses transcription of Eomes and other CD8 lineage genes, such as Cd8a Hence, CD4 T cells can differentiate into Eomes+ cytotoxic CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells by terminating ThPOK expression. In contrast, dual-costimulated CD4 T cells express Eomes, despite the continued expression of ThPOK and the absence of CD8\u03b1, indicating that Eomes is selectively released from ThPOK repression. Finally, although Eomes was induced by CD137 agonist, but not CD134 agonist, administered individually, CD137 agonist failed to induce CD134-/- CD4 T cells to express Eomes or Runx3, indicating that both costimulatory pathways are required for cytotoxic Th1 programming, even when only CD137 is intentionally engaged with a therapeutic agonist.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit", "Immunotherapy", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Receptors, OX40", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Payal", "Last Name": "Mittal", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Abblett", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Adam T", "Last Name": "Hagymasi", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Archibald", "Last Name": "Agyekum-Yamoah", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Svedova", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Reiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; and."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Clare", "Last Name": "St Rose", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "Hanley", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Anthony T", "Last Name": "Vella", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Adler", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT 06030; aadler@uchc.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2018Feb15"}, {"PMID": "31022688", "Title": "Correction: IRF4 Couples Anabolic Metabolism to Th1 Cell Fate Determination.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Radomir", "Last Name": "Kratchmarov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone A", "Last Name": "Nish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wen-Hsuan W", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William C", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yen-Hua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Yen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nyanza J", "Last Name": "Rothman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ulf", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Reiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ImmunoHorizons", "PubDate": "2018Jan02"}, {"PMID": "28944344", "Title": "IRF4 Couples Anabolic Metabolism to Th1 Cell Fate Determination.", "Abstract": "Anabolic metabolism in lymphocytes promotes plasmablast and cytotoxic T cell differentiation at the expense of self-renewal.

Constitutively active FLT3-ITD promotes the expansion of transformed progenitors, but also has pleiotropic effects on hematopoiesis. We analyzed the effect of FLT3-ITD on dendritic cells (DCs), which express FLT3 and can be expanded by FLT3L administration. Pre-leukemic mice with the Flt3(ITD) knock-in allele manifested an expansion of classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs. The expansion originated in DC progenitors, was cell intrinsic, and was further enhanced in Flt3(ITD/ITD) mice. The mutation caused the down-regulation of Flt3 on the surface of DCs and reduced their responsiveness to Flt3L. Both canonical Batf3-dependent CD8(+) cDCs and noncanonical CD8(+) cDCs were expanded and showed specific alterations in their expression profiles. Flt3(ITD) mice showed enhanced capacity to support T cell proliferation, including a cell-extrinsic expansion of regulatory T (T reg) cells. Accordingly, these mice restricted alloreactive T cell responses during graft-versus-host reaction, but failed to control autoimmunity without T reg cells. Thus, the FLT3-ITD mutation directly affects DC development, indirectly modulating T cell homeostasis and supporting T reg cell expansion.

In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autistic Disorder", "Body Patterning", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Pathways", "Neurons", "PAX6 Transcription Factor", "Paired Box Transcription Factors", "Pregnancy", "Repressor Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "T-Box Domain Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gina E", "Last Name": "Elsen", "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Brain Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca D", "Last Name": "Hodge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Bedogni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ray A M", "Last Name": "Daza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Branden R", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Naoko", "Last Name": "Shiba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Reiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Hevner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Mar05"}, {"PMID": "23192430", "Title": "Technical Advance: Fluorescent reporter reveals insights into eomesodermin biology in cytotoxic lymphocytes.", "Abstract": "The T-box transcription factor Eomes is expressed in cytotoxic immune cells and plays an important role in development, maintenance, and function of these cell types. Identification and separation of cells with differential Eomes expression would allow for better understanding of the transcriptional program governing these cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we report the use of an Eomes(gfp)-targeted mouse allele that displays robust fidelity to Eomes protein expression in NK and T cells. Use of this reporter mouse revealed that Eomes expression in antiviral effector cells did not correlate with enhanced cytotoxicity but rather was associated with more efficient central memory differentiation. Weakening of reporter activity in Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells revealed a critical role for Eomes protein in maintaining central memory cells that have activated the Eomes locus. Characterization of reporter activity in NK lineage cells also permitted identification of a novel intermediate of NK cell maturation. Thus, the murine Eomes(gfp)-targeted allele provides a novel opportunity to explore Eomes biology in cytotoxic lymphocytes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Flow Cytometry", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Mice", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Paley", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott M", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth K", "Last Name": "Bikoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth J", "Last Name": "Robertson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "E John", "Last Name": "Wherry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Reiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of leukocyte biology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
