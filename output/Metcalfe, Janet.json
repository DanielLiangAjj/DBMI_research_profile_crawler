On a more positive note, TOT states are also associated with intense goal-directed curiosity and with a strong desire to know that translates into successful mental action. The present study showed that prior to the presentation of resolving feedback to verbal queries-if the individual was in a TOT state-alpha suppression was in evidence in the EEG. This alpha suppression appears to be a marker of a spontaneously occurring, conscious, and highly motivating goal-directed internal metacognitive state.

Both alpha and alpha suppression were observed broadly across centro-parietal scalp electrodes and disappeared immediately upon presentation of the resolving feedback.

The fact that the kind of errors that produced such a benefit, in past research, were those that were semantically related to the correct answer suggested that the effect may occur because the error provides a semantic stepping stone to the correct answer: the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. This hypothesis seems at odds with the finding that amnesicsgenerate answers, again including those studied by Tulving and his colleagues-who purportedly have spared semantic/implicit memory-experience enormous difficulties when they commit errors. Accordingly, the present experiments investigated whether the error-generation benefit seen in typicals was attributable Semantic Mediation or to Episodic Recollection. In Experiment 1, we used polysemous materials to create Congruent (e.g., wrist-palm) and Incongruent (e.g., tree-palm) cues for target words (e.g., HAND). In the Congruent condition, participants generated errors that were semantically related to the target (e.g., finger), and which could have provided a semantic mediator. In the Incongruent condition they generated errors that were unrelated to the target (e.g., coconut), and which, therefore, should not have provided a semantic mediator. The Congruent and Incongruent conditions both produced an error-generation benefit-contradicting the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. Experiment 2 showed that the error-generation benefit only occurred when the original error was also recollected on the final memory test. Indeed, in the Incongruent condition, when the error was not, itself, recalled, error generation resulted in a deficit in memory for the correct response.

The sense of agency refers to the feeling that we are in control of our actions, and that, through them, we can control our external environment. Thus, agency clearly involves matching intentions, actions, and outcomes. The present studies investigated the possibility that processes of action selection, i.e., choosing what action to make, contribute to the sense of agency. Since selection of action necessarily precedes execution of action, such effects must be prospective. In contrast, most literature on sense of agency has focussed on the retrospective computation whether an outcome fits the action performed or intended. This hypothesis was tested in an ecologically rich, dynamic task based on a computer game. Across three experiments, we manipulated three different aspects of action selection processing: visual processing fluency, categorization ambiguity, and response conflict. Additionally, we measured the relative contributions of prospective, action selection-based cues, and retrospective, outcome-based cues to the sense of agency. Manipulations of action selection were orthogonally combined with discrepancy of visual feedback of action. Fluency of action selection had a small but reliable effect on the sense of agency. Additionally, as expected, sense of agency was strongly reduced when visual feedback was discrepant with the action performed. The effects of discrepant feedback were larger than the effects of action selection fluency, and sometimes suppressed them. The sense of agency is highly sensitive to disruptions of action-outcome relations. However, when motor control is successful, and action-outcome relations are as predicted, fluency or dysfluency of action selection provides an important prospective cue to the sense of agency.", "Keywords": ["action selection", "fluency", "metacognition", "motor control", "sense of agency"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nura", "Last Name": "Sidarus", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College LondonLondon, UK."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Vuorre", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New YorkNY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New YorkNY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Haggard", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College LondonLondon, UK."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28429177", "Title": "Learning from one's own errors and those of others.", "Abstract": "Three experiments investigated the effects of making errors oneself, as compared to just hearing the correct answer without error generation, hearing another person make an error, or being \"on-the-hook,\" that is, possibly but not necessarily being the person who would be \"called-on\" to give a response.

Both experiments varied (a) proximal action-related information by either introducing or not introducing Turbulence into the mouse controls and (b) distal outcome-related information such that touched X's \"exploded\" either 100 or 75\u00a0% of the time. Both variables affected people's judgments of agency (JOAs), but the effect was different. First, the decrement in feelings of agency was greater with the proximal variable than with distal variable. Second, while the proximal variable always had a large direct effect on JOAs, even taking judgments of performance (JOPs) into account, JOPs completely accounted for the effect of the distal variable in Experiment 1, where the instructions were just to touch the X's.

The proximal action-related information is a diagnostic cue to agency indicating the match between one's own intentions and actions. Internal monitoring of intentions is necessary and so the self is implicated. However, distal outcome can be largely monitored using information external to the agent, and so-while it is used by people to make agency judgments-it is a non-diagnostic cue.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Behavior", "Cues", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Psychomotor Performance", "Volition", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA. jm348@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Teal S", "Last Name": "Eich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Miele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Experimental brain research", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23241028", "Title": "The hypercorrection effect in younger and older adults.", "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The hypercorrection effect, which refers to the finding that errors committed with high confidence are more likely to be corrected than are low confidence errors, has been replicated many times, and with both young adults and children. In the present study, we contrasted older with younger adults. Participants answered general-information questions, made confidence ratings about their answers, were given corrective feedback, and then were retested on questions that they had gotten wrong. While younger adults showed the hypercorrection effect, older adults, despite higher overall accuracy on the general-information questions and excellent basic metacognitive ability, showed a diminished hypercorrection effect. Indeed, the correspondence between their confidence in their errors and the probability of correction was not significantly greater than zero, showing, for the first time, that a particular participant population is selectively impaired on this error correction task. These results potentially offer leverage both on the mechanisms underlying the hypercorrection effect and on reasons for older adults' memory impairments, as well as on memory functions that are spared.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Retention, Psychology", "Self Concept", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Teal S", "Last Name": "Eich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. tse4@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuropsychology, development, and cognition.
