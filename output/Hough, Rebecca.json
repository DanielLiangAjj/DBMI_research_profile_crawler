Multiple organ failure predisposes to the mortality, but mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays a role in the barrier failure. Subsequent lung-liver cross talk mediated by neutrophil activation causes liver congestion. We intranasally instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, we viewed the lung endothelium by real-time confocal imaging of the isolated, blood-perfused mouse lung. LPS caused alveolar-capillary transfer of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial depolarization in lung venular capillaries. The mitochondrial depolarization was inhibited by transfection of alveolar Catalase and vascular knockdown of UCP2. LPS instillation caused lung injury as indicated by increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein content and extravascular lung water. LPS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa instillation also caused liver congestion, quantified by liver hemoglobin and plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases. Genetic inhibition of vascular UCP2 prevented both lung injury and liver congestion. Antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion blocked the liver responses, but not lung injury. Knockdown of lung vascular UCP2 mitigated P. aeruginosa-induced mortality. Together, these data suggest a mechanism in which bacterial pneumonia induces oxidative signaling to lung venular capillaries, known sites of inflammatory signaling in the lung microvasculature, depolarizing venular mitochondria. Successive activation of neutrophils induces liver congestion. We conclude that oxidant-induced UCP2 expression in lung venular capillaries causes a mechanistic sequence leading to liver congestion and mortality. Lung vascular UCP2 may present a therapeutic target in ARDS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We report that mitochondrial injury in lung venular capillaries underlies barrier failure in pneumonia, and venular capillary uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) causes neutrophil-mediated liver congestion. Using in situ imaging, we found that epithelial-endothelial transfer of H2O2 activates UCP2, depolarizing mitochondria in venular capillaries. The conceptual advance from our findings is that mitochondrial depolarization in lung capillaries mediates liver cross talk through circulating neutrophils. Pharmacologic blockade of UCP2 could be a therapeutic strategy for lung injury.", "Keywords": ["acute lung injury", "endothelium", "lung capillaries", "mitochondria", "nonpulmonary organ injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Capillaries", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Liver", "Mitochondria", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Lung Injury", "Pneumonia, Bacterial", "Mitochondrial Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Memet T", "Last Name": "Emin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jahar", "Last Name": "Bhattacharya", "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Laboratory, Pulmonary Division, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca F", "Last Name": "Hough", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway plays critical roles in regulating embryonic development and physiological processes. This pathway is tightly regulated to ensure its proper activity. In the absence of Wnt ligands, \u03b2-catenin is degraded by a destruction complex. When the pathway is stimulated by a\u00a0Wnt ligand, \u03b2-catenin dissociates from the destruction complex and translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to regulate target gene expression. Aberrant activation of this pathway, which leads to the hyperactivity of \u03b2-catenin, has been reported in ovarian cancer. Specifically, mutations of CTNNB1, AXIN, or APC, have been observed in the endometrioid and mucinous subtypes of EOC. In addition, upregulation of the ligands, abnormal activation of the receptors or intracellular mediators, disruption of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, inhibition of the association of \u03b2-catenin/E-cadherin on the cell membrane, and aberrant promotion of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity, have all been reported in EOC, especially in the high grade serous subtype. Furthermore, several non-coding RNAs have been shown to regulate EOC development, in part, through the modulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway has been reported to promote cancer stem cell self-renewal, metastasis, and chemoresistance in all subtypes of EOC. Emerging evidence also suggests that the pathway induces ovarian tumor angiogenesis and immune evasion. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway plays critical roles in EOC development and is a strong candidate for the development of targeted therapies.", "Keywords": ["Ovarian cancer", "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling", "cancer stem cells", "metastasis", "microRNAs", "tumor angiogenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Female", "Humans", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Wnt Signaling Pathway", "beta Catenin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vu Hong Loan", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Hough", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie", "Last Name": "Bernaudo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Chun", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. cpeng@yorku.ca."}], "Journal": "Journal of ovarian research", "PubDate": "2019Dec11"}, {"PMID": "31331310", "Title": "The impact of a\u00a0fellow-driven debriefing program after pediatric cardiac arrests.", "Abstract": "In the United States, post-cardiac arrest debriefing has increased, but historically it has occurred rarely in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

As a result, rapid endothelial activation induces alveolar inflammation, leading to life-threatening pulmonary edema. Because mechanisms underlying the rapid endothelial activation are not understood, here we determined responses in real time through optical imaging of alveoli of live mouse lungs. By alveolar micropuncture, we microinfused concentrated HCl in the alveolar lumen. As expected, acid contact with the epithelium caused rapid, but transient, apical injury. However, there was no concomitant membrane injury to the endothelium. Nevertheless, H2O2-mediated epithelial-endothelial paracrine signaling induced endothelial barrier failure, as detected by microvascular dextran leakage and lung water quantification. Remarkably, endothelial mitochondria regulated the barrier failure by activating uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), thereby inducing transient mitochondrial depolarization that led to cofilin-induced actin depolymerization. Knockdown, or endothelium-targeted deletion of UCP2 expression, blocked these responses, including pulmonary edema. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to mechanistically implicate endothelial mitochondria in acid-induced barrier deterioration and pulmonary edema.
