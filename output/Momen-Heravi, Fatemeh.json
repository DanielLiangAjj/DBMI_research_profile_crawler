In this study we determine for the first time a combined epigenetic, gene expression, and histology signature that differentiates between patients with different tobacco use history (heavy tobacco use with \u226510 pack years vs. no tobacco use). Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n\u2009=\u2009257) and an internal cohort (n\u2009=\u200940), we identify 3 epigenetic markers (GPR15, GNG12, GDNF) and 13 expression markers (IGHA2, SCG5, RPL3L, NTRK1, CD96, BMP6, TFPI2, EFEMP2, RYR3, DMTN, GPD2, BAALC, and FMO3), which are dysregulated in OSCC patients who were never smokers vs. those who have a\u2009\u2265\u200910 pack year history. While mortality risk prediction based on smoking status and clinicopathologic covariates alone is inaccurate (c-statistic\u2009=\u20090.57), the combined epigenetic/expression and histologic signature has a c-statistic\u2009=\u20090.9409 in predicting 5-year mortality in OSCC patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chi T", "Last Name": "Viet", "Affiliation":

Here, we developed the modular safeEXO platform, a prototype sEV delivery vehicle that is mostly devoid of endogenous RNA and can efficaciously deliver RNA and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to their intended intracellular targets manifested by downstream biologic activity. We also successfully engineered producer cells to produce safeEXO vehicles that contain endogenous Cas9 (safeEXO-CAS) to effectively deliver efficient ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated CRISPR genome editing machinery to organs or diseased cells in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed that safeEXO-CAS sEVs could co-deliver ssDNA, sgRNA and siRNA, and efficaciously mediate gene insertion in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated the potential to target safeEXO-CAS sEVs by engineering sEVs to express a tissue-specific moiety, integrin alpha-6 (safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6), which increased their uptake to lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. We tested the ability of safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6 loaded with EMX1 sgRNAs to induce lung-targeted editing in mice, which demonstrated significant gene editing in the lungs with no signs of morbidity or detectable changes in immune cell populations. Our results demonstrate that our modular safeEXO platform represents a targetable, safe, and efficacious vehicle to deliver nucleic acid-based therapeutics that successfully reach their intracellular targets.

Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments.

long-lasting response. FAP-targeted molecular radiotherapy has shown efficacy in both preclinical and clinical models and has immunomodulatory effects. Here, we studied if combined immunotherapy and radiotherapy could increase antitumor efficacy in murine models of lung cancer and melanoma and interrogated the mechanisms by which these treatments attenuate tumor growth. Using LLC1 and B16F10 murine models of lung cancer and melanoma, respectively, we tested the efficacy of 177Lu-FAPI-04 alone and in combination with immunotherapy. Alone, 177Lu-FAPI-04 significantly reduced tumor growth in both models. In animals with melanoma, combined therapy resulted in tumor regression while lung tumor growth was attenuated, but tumors did not regress. Combined therapy significantly increased caspase-3 and decreased Ki67 compared with immunotherapy alone. Flow cytometry demonstrated that tumor-associated macrophages responded in a tumor-dependent manner which was distinct in animals treated with both therapies compared with either therapy alone. These data demonstrate that 177Lu-FAPI-04 is an effective anticancer therapy for melanoma and lung cancer which mediates effects at least partially through induction of apoptosis and modulation of the immune response.

We evaluated the efficacy of various treatment regimens in terms of survival benefit compared to surgery only in patients stratified into high (risk score \u22650) versus low (risk score <0) mortality risk categories. For the high-risk group, surgery with neck dissection significantly improved the 5-year survival to 75% from 46% with surgery only (p < 0.001); a Cox proportional hazard model on time-to-death demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.37 for surgery with neck dissection (95% CI: 0.2-0.6; p=0.0005). For the low-risk group, surgery only was the treatment of choice associated with 5-year survival benefit. Regardless of treatment selected, those with risk score \u22652 may benefit from additional therapy to prevent cancer relapse. We also identified hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) as a gene target common to the prognostic miRNAs.

As such they offer a glimpse into the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) and have the potential to be a novel, minimally invasive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti- programmed death-1(PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies, have revolutionized the treatment of a wide variety of solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.

There is an unmet need for noninvasive or minimally invasive (e.g., plasma-based) biomarkers both for diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

The contribution of different subsets of monocytes/macrophages to periodontal health and disease has not been fully elucidated. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis. We hypothesized that the monocyte/macrophage signaling is perturbed in periodontitis-affected sites versus periodontally healthy sites and that this perturbation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Pairs of gingival tissue samples (each from a periodontally healthy and a periodontitis-affected site of the same patient) were harvested from 27 periodontitis patients, with and without T2DM. Each sample was processed to form a single-cell suspension, and a flow-cytometry panel was designed and validated to study monocyte and macrophage phenotypes. In separate experiments, the transcriptional changes associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype were also examined in monocyte/macrophage subsets obtained from peripheral blood of patients with T2DM versus diabetes-free controls. A significantly higher proportion of intermediate (CD14+CD16+) monocytes was observed in periodontitis-affected tissues compared to healthy tissues. These monocytes overexpressed HLA-DR and PDL1 molecules, suggesting their activated inflammatory status. PDL1 increase was specific to intermediate monocytes. The ratio of M1/M2 macrophages was also significantly higher in periodontally affected sites, signifying an imbalance between inflammatory and repair mechanisms. We found a significantly higher expression of PDL1 in overall monocytes and M1 macrophages in periodontitis-affected sites compared to controls. Importantly, we identified a subpopulation of M1 macrophages present in periodontally affected tissues which expressed high levels of CD47, a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin family that plays a critical role in self-recognition and impairment of phagocytosis. Analysis of the transcriptional landscape of monocytes/macrophages in gingival tissue of T2DM patients with periodontitis revealed a significant disruption in homeostasis toward a proinflammatory phenotype, elevation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1, and repression of anti-inflammatory JMJD3 in circulating monocytes. Taken together, our results demonstrate disruption of myeloid-derived cell homeostasis in periodontitis, with or without T2DM, and highlight a potentially significant role of these cell types in its pathogenesis. The impact of macrophage and monocyte signaling pathways on the pathobiology of periodontitis should be further evaluated.", "Keywords": ["CD47", "diabetes", "macrophages", "monocytes",

Although it has been shown that EVs can play an active role in cellular communication and different stages of cancer progression, the role of EVs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cancer pathogenesis, especially in the crosstalk of cancer cells with immune cells is unknown. Here, we present a detailed analysis of findings regarding the profile of EVs in OSCC and the role of EVs and associated miRNAs in the crosstalk of malignant cells with monocytes. We demonstrate that EVs are detectable in significantly higher quantities in the plasma of patients with OSCC. Oncogenic miRNAs (such as miR-21, miR-27) were detectable in high quantities in the circulating EVs and plasma of patients with OSCC. EVs isolated from the circulation of OSCC patients and OSCC cell lines showed comparable miRNA signature, indicating the tumor origin of EVs in the circulation of patients with OSCC. Danger signals such as LPS and ethanol increased the production of EVs. EVs were taken up by monocytes after co-culture. Mechanistically, uptake of EVs derived from oral cancer cells by monocytes caused activation of the inflammatory pathway, NF-\u03baB activation, and establishment of a pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic milieu marked by increased levels of IL-6, CCL2, PEG2 and MMP9 levels. Series of experiments involving the introduction of exogenous oncogenic miR-21 mimic induced a similar pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic profile in monocytes. Inhibiting miR-21 function in monocytes attenuated the pro-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes after EV challenge.

Specifically, in patients with solid tumors, EVs are released from cancerous cells at a higher rate than from healthy cells and are enriched in tumor signature molecules. Because of their stability, increased concentration, and unique signatures in cancer patients, EVs have become the subject of investigation for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Moreover, understanding EVs' biogenesis and biological role could lead to novel insights toward cellular cross talk and complex biological pathways in cancer research. To make use of EVs for diagnostic and mechanistic cancer research, standardized well-characterized methods are required.

Emerging lines of evidence indicates that deregulated expression of lncRNAs and circular RNAs are associated with the induction and progression of various cancers, including oral cancer, through epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional alterations. In this review, we highlight the expression and functional roles of extracellular RNAs, lncRNAs, and circular RNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma and discuss their potential clinical applications as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": ["Circular RNAs", "Exosomes", "Extracellular RNAs", "Oral cancer", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma", "lncRNAs", "miRNAs"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Disease Progression", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Exosomes", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "MicroRNAs", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "RNA, Long Noncoding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Division of Periodontics, Section of Oral and Diagnostic Sciences, Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, New York, NY 10032, USA.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate multivariable hazard ratio (HR) for the association of tumor CASR expression with colorectal cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We adjusted for potential confounders including tumor biomarkers such as microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation level, expressions of PTGS2, VDR and CTNNB1 and mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. There were 240 colorectal cancer-specific deaths and 427 all-cause deaths. The median follow-up of censored patients was 10.8 years (interquartile range: 7.2, 15.1).

We observed increased numbers of EVs, mostly exosomes, secreted by primary human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells in the presence of alcohol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. EVs derived from alcohol-treated monocytes stimulated naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages as indicated by increased surface expression of CD68 (macrophage marker), M2 markers (CD206 (mannose receptor) and CD163 (scavenger receptor)), secretion of IL-10, and TGF\u03b2 and increased phagocytic activity. miRNA profiling of the EVs derived from alcohol-treated THP-1 monocytes revealed high expression of the M2-polarizing miRNA, miR-27a. Treatment of naive monocytes with control EVs overexpressing miR-27a reproduced the effect of EVs from alcohol-treated monocytes on naive monocytes and induced M2 polarization, suggesting that the effect of alcohol EVs was mediated by miR-27a. We found that miR-27a modulated the process of phagocytosis by targeting CD206 expression on monocytes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate all of these processes. MiRNA-122 is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes while monocytes/macrophages have low levels. The role of exosomes in AH and possible cross talk between hepatocyte-derived exosomes and immune cells is not explored yet. Here, we show that the number of exosomes significantly increases in the sera of healthy individuals after alcohol binge drinking and in mice after binge or chronic alcohol consumption. Exosomes isolated from sera after alcohol consumption or from in vitro ethanol-treated hepatocytes contained miRNA-122. Exosomes derived from ethanol-treated Huh7.5 cells were taken up by the recipients THP1 monocytes and horizontally transferred a mature form of liver-specific miRNA-122. In vivo, liver mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells from alcohol-fed mice had increased miRNA-122 levels. In monocytes, miRNA-122 transferred via exosomes inhibited the HO-1 pathway and sensitized to LPS stimulation and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, inflammatory effects of exosomes from ethanol-treated hepatocytes were prevented by using RNA interference via exosome-mediated delivery of a miRNA-122 inhibitor. These results demonstrate that first, exosomes mediate communication between hepatocytes and monocytes/macrophages and second, hepatocyte-derived miRNA-122 can reprogram monocytes inducing sensitization to LPS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alcoholism", "Animals", "Binge Drinking", "Cell Communication", "Cell Line", "Ethanol", "Exosomes", "Female", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Liver", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "MicroRNAs", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shashi", "Last Name": "Bala", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Kodys", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gyongyi", "Last Name": "Szabo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2015May14"}, {"PMID": "25275643", "Title": "Exosomes from hepatitis C infected patients transmit HCV infection and contain replication competent viral RNA in complex with Ago2-miR122-HSP90.", "Abstract": "Antibodies targeting receptor-mediated entry of HCV into hepatocytes confer limited therapeutic benefits.

Here, we showed that B cell-derived exosomes can function as vehicles to deliver exogenous miRNA-155 mimic or inhibitor into hepatocytes or macrophages, respectively. Stimulation of B cells significantly increased exosome production. Unlike in parental cells, baseline level of miRNA-155 was very low in exosomes derived from stimulated B cells. Exosomes loaded with a miRNA-155 mimic significantly increased miRNA-155 levels in primary mouse hepatocytes and the liver of miRNA-155 knockout mice. Treatment of RAW macrophages with miRNA-155 inhibitor loaded exosomes resulted in statistically significant reduction in LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 production and partially prevented LPS-induced decrease in SOCS1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, exosome-mediated miRNA-155 inhibitor delivery resulted in functionally more efficient inhibition and less cellular toxicity compared to conventional transfection methods.
