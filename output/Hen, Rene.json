[{"PMID": "38496461", "Title": "Effects of electroconvulsive shock on the function, circuitry, and transcriptome of dentate gyrus granule neurons.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic use of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) is 75% effective for the remission of treatment-resistant depression. Like other more common forms of antidepressant treatment such as fluoxetine, ECS has been shown to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rodent models. Yet the question of how ECS-induced neurogenesis supports improvement of depressive symptoms remains unknown. Here, we show that ECS-induced neurogenesis is necessary to improve depressive-like behavior of mice exposed to chronic corticosterone (Cort). We then use slice electrophysiology to show that optogenetic stimulation of adult-born neurons produces a greater hyperpolarization in mature granule neurons after ECS vs Sham treatment. We identify that this hyperpolarization requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2). Consistent with this finding, we observe reduced expression of the immediate early gene cFos in the granule cell layer of ECS vs Sham subjects. We then show that mGluR2 knockdown specifically in ventral granule neurons blunts the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ECS. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing, we reveal major transcriptomic shifts in granule neurons after treatment with ECS+Cort or fluoxetine+Cort vs Cort alone. We identify a population of immature cells which has greater representation in both ECS+Cort and fluoxetine+Cort treated samples vs Cort alone. We also find global differences in ECS-vs fluoxetine-induced transcriptomic shifts. Together, these findings highlight a critical role for immature granule cells and mGluR2 signaling in the antidepressant action of ECS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adrienne N", "Last Name": "Santiago", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Castello-Saval", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phi", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hannah M", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Victor M", "Last Name": "Luna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei-Li", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Mar05"}, {"PMID": "38484060", "Title": "Switching on generalized fear.", "Abstract": "Stress induces a neurotransmitter switch that leads to fear in harmless situations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fear", "Stress, Psychological", "Animals", "Mice", "Neurotransmitter Agents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Schacher", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2024Mar15"}, {"PMID": "38352378", "Title": "Pharmacological Enhancement of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis Improves Behavioral Pattern Separation in Young and Aged Mice.", "Abstract": "Impairments in behavioral pattern separation (BPS)-the ability to distinguish between similar contexts or experiences-contribute to memory interference and overgeneralization seen in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline.

Thus, abGCs facilitate pattern separation through the formation of non-overlapping representations for identical sensory cues encountered in different locations.

Behavioral sensitization, an increased behavioral response to a drug with repeated administration, can persist for many months after the last administration. Research has shown that the serotonin 1B (5-HT1B) receptor plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of drug addiction, as well as other addictive behaviors. This study examined the role of 5-HT1B receptors in METH-induced locomotor sensitization using 5-HT1B knockout (KO) mice. To clarify the action of METH in 5-HT1B KO mice the effects of METH on extracellular levels of DA (DAec) and 5-HT (5-HTec) in the caudate putamen (CPu) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were examined. Locomotor sensitization and extracellular monoamine levels were determined in wild-type mice (5-HT1B +/+), heterozygous 5-HT1B receptor KO (5-HT1B +/-) mice and homozygous 5-HT1B receptor KO mice (5-HT1B -/-). Behavioral sensitization to METH was enhanced in 5-HT1B -/- mice compared to 5-HT1B +/+ mice but was attenuated in 5-HT1B +/- mice compared to 5-HT1B +/+ and 5-HT1B -/- mice. In vivo, microdialysis demonstrated that acute administration of METH increases DAec levels in the CPu and NAc of 5-HT1B KO mice compared to saline groups.

Although SSRIs targeting the serotonergic system are prescribed over 200 million times annually, they have variable therapeutic efficacy and side effects, and mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively characterise the molecular landscape of gene regulatory changes associated with fluoxetine, a widely-used SSRI. We performed multimodal analysis of SSRI response in 27 mammalian brain regions using 310 bulk RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets, followed by in-depth characterisation of two hippocampal regions using single-cell RNA-seq (20 datasets). Remarkably, fluoxetine induced profound region-specific shifts in gene expression and chromatin state, including in the nucleus accumbens shell, locus coeruleus and septal areas, as well as in more well-studied regions such as the raphe and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Expression changes were strongly enriched at GWAS loci for depression and antidepressant drug response, stressing the relevance to human phenotypes. We observed differential expression at dozens of signalling receptors and pathways, many of which are previously unknown. Single-cell analysis revealed stark differences in fluoxetine response between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyri, particularly in oligodendrocytes, mossy cells and inhibitory neurons.

Moreover, the anorectic effect depends on the serotonin (5-HT) 1B receptor (Htr1b). By ablating Htr1b in four different brain regions, we demonstrate that Htr1b engages in spatiotemporally segregated neural pathways to regulate postnatal growth and food intake. Moreover, Htr1b in AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) contributes to the hypophagic effects of HTR1B agonists. To further study the anorexigenic Htr1b circuit, we generated Htr1b-Cre mice. We find that ARH Htr1b neurons bidirectionally regulate food intake in vivo. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses revealed that Htr1b marks a subset of AgRP neurons.

The recent discovery that tianeptine is a mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist has provided a potential avenue for expanding our understanding of antidepressant treatment beyond the monoamine hypothesis. Thus, our studies aim to understand the neural circuits underlying tianeptine's antidepressant effects. We show that tianeptine induces rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice after as little as one week of treatment. Critically, we also demonstrate that tianeptine's mechanism of action is distinct from fluoxetine in two important aspects: (1) tianeptine requires MORs for its chronic antidepressant-like effect, while fluoxetine does not, and (2) unlike fluoxetine, tianeptine does not promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Using cell-type specific MOR knockouts we further show that MOR expression on GABAergic cells-specifically somatostatin-positive neurons-is necessary for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like responses to tianeptine. Using central infusion of tianeptine, we also implicate the ventral hippocampus as a potential site of antidepressant action. Moreover, we show a dissociation between the antidepressant-like phenotype and other opioid-like phenotypes resulting from acute tianeptine administration such as analgesia, conditioned place preference, and hyperlocomotion.

The effects of promoting AHN on the recovery of stress-induced symptoms have been well studied, but its involvement in stress resilience remains elusive. We used a mouse model enabling us to foster AHN before the exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to evaluate the potential protective effects of AHN on stress, assessing the depressive-like phenotype and executive functions. For this purpose, an inducible transgenic mouse model was used to delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from neural progenitors four weeks before UCMS, whereby increasing the survival of adult-generated neurons.

It is now accepted that antidepressant treatments can oppose and even reverse the effects of stress on the brain and on newly born hippocampal cells, possibly via neurotrophic factors, which Duman had continued to explore. Furthermore, ablation studies have shown preclinically that hippocampal neurogenesis may be necessary for some of the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs. Duman's laboratory continued to interrogate neurotrophins and synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that newer clinically approved antidepressant compounds also affect neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

Up to date, the therapeutic targets and approaches are still limited. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been proposed as a critical contributor to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, altering the hippocampal control over stress response at network, neuroendocrine and behavioral levels. These findings together have suggested that manipulating AHN may be a promising therapeutic strategy for depression. To investigate this question, we assessed whether increasing adult neurogenesis would be sufficient to produce antidepressant-like effects at behavioral and neuroendocrine levels in a mouse model of depression; the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). For this purpose, we used a bi-transgenic mouse line (iBax) in which AHN increase was induced by deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from the neural progenitors following the tamoxifen-dependent action of CreERT2 recombinases. UCMS induced a syndrome that is reminiscent of depression-like states, including anhedonia (cookie test), physical changes (coat deterioration, reduced weight gain), anxiety-like behaviors (higher latency in the novelty-supressed feeding -NSF- test), passive stress-coping behaviors (immobility in the forced swim test -FST-) and a blunted hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to acute stress in addition to AHN decrease. Tamoxifen injection reversed the AHN decrease as well as partly counteracted UCMS effects on the cookie test and HPA axis but not for the coat state, weight gain, NSF test and FST.

Notably, 5-HT1A levels in humans display remarkable variation, and differences in receptor levels have been linked with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Further, reduction of receptor levels by 30-50% in mice suggests that changes in receptor levels that model existing human variation are sufficient to drive behavioral alterations. As a result, genetic mechanisms that modulate human 5-HT1A levels may be important for explaining individual differences in mood and behavior, representing a potential source of psychiatric disease risk. One common genetic variant implicated in differential 5-HT1A levels is the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6295, located upstream of the human 5-HT1A gene. This SNP differentially binds the transcription factor, NUDR/Deaf1, leading to cell-type specific effects on transcription in vitro. To investigate the direct effects of this SNP in the heterogeneous cellular context of the brain, we generated humanized transgenic mice using a design that maximized the local transcriptional landscape of the human HTR1A gene while also controlling for effects of genomic insertion location. We integrated a 180 kb human bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene containing G- and C-alleles of rs6295 flanked by FRT or loxP sites. Subsequent deletion of each allele by Cre- or Flp-recombinase resulted in rs6295G and C alleles in the same genomic location. These alleles were bred onto a 5-HT1A null mouse such that the human BAC was the sole source of 5-HT1A in these mice. We generated three separate lines, two of which had detectable human 5-HT1A levels in the brain, although none displayed expression in the raphe. Of these, one line exhibited rs6295-dependent differences in 5-HT1A levels and differences in behavior, even though the overall levels were considerably lower than native expression levels. The line-dependent effect of rs6295 on protein levels and behavior may depend upon differences in background genetic factors or different insertion sites across each line. This work confirms that relatively subtle differences in 5-HT1A levels can contribute to differences in behavior and highlights the challenges of modeling human noncoding genetic variation in mice.", "Keywords": ["5-HT1A", "BAC transgenic", "HTR1A", "anxiety", "depression", "genetic variation", "humanized", "rs6295"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Disease Models, Animal", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Activity", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashley M", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Division of Integrative Neuroscience , New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Tabia L", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Division of Integrative Neuroscience , New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa A", "Last Name": "Gutzeit", "Affiliation": "Division of Integrative Neuroscience , New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Departments of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Psychology and Neuroscience , University of Colorado Boulder , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Division of Integrative Neuroscience , New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Zoe R", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "Departments of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Psychology and Neuroscience , University of Colorado Boulder , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Jul17"}, {"PMID": "30552180", "Title": "Loss of Adult 5-HT1A Autoreceptors Results in a Paradoxical Anxiogenic Response to Antidepressant Treatment.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants but require several weeks to elicit their actions. Chronic SSRI treatment induces desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to enhance 5-HT neurotransmission. Mice (both sexes) with gene deletion of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in adult 5-HT neurons (1AcKO) were tested for response to SSRIs. Tamoxifen-induced recombination in adult 1AcKO mice specifically reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels. The 1AcKO mice showed a loss of 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated hypothermia and electrophysiological responses, but no changes in anxiety- or depression-like behavior. Subchronic fluoxetine (FLX) treatment induced an unexpected anxiogenic effect in 1AcKO mice in the novelty suppressed feeding and elevated plus maze tests, as did escitalopram in the novelty suppressed feeding test. No effect was seen in wild-type (WT) mice. Subchronic FLX increased 5-HT metabolism in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and raphe of 1AcKO but not WT mice, suggesting hyperactivation of 5-HT release. To detect chronic cellular activation, FosB+ cells were quantified. FosB+ cells were reduced in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (CA2/3) and increased in dorsal raphe 5-HT cells of 1AcKO mice, suggesting increased raphe activation. In WT but not 1AcKO mice, FLX reduced FosB+ cells in the median raphe, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and median septum, which receive rich 5-HT projections. Thus, in the absence of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, SSRIs induce a paradoxical anxiogenic response. This may involve imbalance in activation of dorsal and median raphe to regulate septohippocampal or fimbria-fornix pathways. These results suggest that markedly reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptors may provide a marker for aberrant response to SSRI treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating anxiety and depression in humans and mouse models. However, in some cases, SSRIs can increase anxiety, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we show that, rather than enhancing SSRI benefits, adulthood knockout (KO) of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, a critical negative regulator of 5-HT activity, results in an SSRI-induced anxiety effect that appears to involve a hyperactivation of the 5-HT system in certain brain areas. Thus, subjects with very low levels of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, such as during childhood or adolescence, may be at risk for an SSRI-induced anxiety response.", "Keywords": ["5-HT1A receptor", "anxiety", "autoreceptor", "knock-out", "raphe", "serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin", "Animals", "Antidepressive Agents", "Anxiety", "Autoreceptors", "Brain Chemistry", "Exploratory Behavior", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Fluoxetine", "Hypothermia", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Net", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A", "Serotonergic Neurons", "Serotonin", "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors", "Swimming"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Val\u00e9rie", "Last Name": "Turcotte-Cardin", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Neuroscience), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Faranak", "Last Name": "Vahid-Ansari", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Neuroscience), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Luckhart", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Neuroscience), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Mireille", "Last Name": "Daigle", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Neuroscience), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sean D", "Last Name": "Geddes", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kenji F", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute and Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "Royal's Institute of Mental Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, K1Z 7K4 Canada."}, {"First Name": "Zul", "Last Name": "Merali", "Affiliation": "Royal's Institute of Mental Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, K1Z 7K4 Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Claude", "Last Name": "B\u00e9\u00efque", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Paul R", "Last Name": "Albert", "Affiliation": "Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Neuroscience), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada, palbert@uottawa.ca."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Feb20"}, {"PMID": "30526880", "Title": "Considerations for Assessing the Extent of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in the Adult and Aging Human Brain.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Neurogenesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandria N", "Last Name": "Tartt", "Affiliation": "Divisions of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Camille A", "Last Name": "Fulmore", "Affiliation": "Divisions of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Divisions of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gorazd B", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "Divisions of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA;

We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages.

To test the role of Freud-1 in vivo, we generated mice with adulthood conditional knock-out of Freud-1 in 5-HT neurons (cF1ko). In cF1ko mice, 5-HT1A autoreceptor protein, binding and hypothermia response were increased, with reduced 5-HT content and neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe. The cF1ko mice displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior that was resistant to chronic antidepressant (fluoxetine) treatment. Using conditional Freud-1/5-HT1A double knock-out (cF1/1A dko) to disrupt both Freud-1 and 5-HT1A genes in 5-HT neurons, no increase in anxiety- or depression-like behavior was seen upon knock-out of Freud-1 on the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-negative background; rather, a reduction in depression-like behavior emerged. These studies implicate transcriptional dysregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors by the repressor Freud-1 in anxiety and depression and provide a clinically relevant genetic model of antidepressant resistance.

Adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for several effects of antidepressants and increasing the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) before exposure to chronic corticosterone is sufficient to protect against its harmful effects on behavior. However, it is an open question if increasing AHN after the onset of chronic stress exposure would be able to rescue behavioral deficits and which mechanisms might be involved in recovery. We investigated this question by using a 10-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on a transgenic mouse line (iBax mice), in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax can be inducibly ablated in neural stem cells following Tamoxifen injection, therefore enhancing the survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. We did not observe any effect of our treatment in non-stress conditions, but we did find that increasing AHN after 2 weeks of UCMS is sufficient to counteract the effects of UCMS on certain behaviors (splash test and changes in coat state) and endocrine levels and thus to display some antidepressant-like effects. We observed that increasing AHN lowered the elevated basal corticosterone levels in mice exposed to UCMS. This was accompanied by a tamoxifen-induced reversal of the lack of stress-induced decrease in neuronal activation in the anteromedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMA) after intrahippocampal dexamethasone infusion, pointing to a possible mechanism through which adult-born neurons might have exerted their effects. Our results contribute to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression by suggesting that increasing AHN may be beneficial not just before, but also after exposure to stress by counteracting several of its effects, in part through regulating the HPA axis.", "Keywords": ["Animal model", "Anxiety", "Depression", "HPA axis", "Neurogenesis", "Stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Corticosterone", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurogenesis", "Stress, Psychological", "Tamoxifen", "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luka", "Last Name": "Culig", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Surget", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Marlene", "Last Name": "Bourdey", "Affiliation": "UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Wahid", "Last Name": "Khemissi", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Marie", "Last Name": "Le Guisquet", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Elise", "Last Name": "Vogel", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France."}, {"First Name": "Amar", "Last Name": "Sahay", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Belzung", "Affiliation": "U930 \"Imaging and Brain\", Inserm, Tours, France; UFR Sciences et Techniques, Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Tours, France.

Even with an eventual recovery, many patients require a trial and error approach, as there are no reliable guidelines to match patients to optimal treatments and many patients develop treatment resistance over time. This situation derives from the heterogeneity of depression and the lack of biomarkers for stratification by distinct depression subtypes. There is thus a dire need for novel therapies. To address these known challenges, we propose a multi-scale framework for fundamental research on depression, aimed at identifying the brain circuits that are dysfunctional in several animal models of depression as well the changes in gene expression that are associated with these models. When combined with human genetic and imaging studies, our preclinical studies are starting to identify candidate circuits and molecules that are altered both in models of disease and in patient populations. Targeting these circuits and mechanisms can lead to novel generations of antidepressants tailored to specific patient populations with distinctive types of molecular and circuit dysfunction.", "Keywords": ["Amygdala", "ChIP-sequencing", "Epigenetics", "GWAS", "Gene expression", "Hippocampus", "Major depressive disorder", "Neural circuits", "Nucleus accumbens", "Prefrontal cortex", "RNA-sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Systems Biology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huda", "Last Name": "Akil", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; University of Michigan, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Columbia University, United States; New York State Psychiatric Institute, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rene", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Columbia University, United States; New York State Psychiatric Institute, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Columbia University, United States; New York State Psychiatric Institute, United States."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Mayberg", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Emory University, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "McEwen", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Rockefeller University, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Meaney", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; McGill University, United States; Singapore Institute for Clinical Science, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Nestler", "Affiliation": "Depression Task Force, Hope for Depression Research Foundation, New York, NY 10019, United States; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States.

Two behavioral features often considered in impulsive behavior are behavioral inhibition (impulsive action) and delayed gratification (impulsive choice). However, the extent to which these behavioral constructs represent distinct facets of behavior with discrete biological bases is unclear. To test the hypothesis that impulsive action and impulsive choice represent statistically independent behavioral constructs in mice, we collected behavioral measures of impulsivity in a single cohort of mice using well-validated operant behavioral paradigms. Mice with manipulation of serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) expression were included as a model of disordered impulsivity. A factor analysis was used to characterize correlations between the measures of impulsivity and to identify covariates. Using two approaches, we dissociated impulsive action from impulsive choice. First, the absence of 5-HT1BRs caused increased impulsive action, but not impulsive choice. Second, based on an exploratory factor analysis, a two-factor model described the data well, with measures of impulsive action and choice separating into two independent factors. A multiple-indicator multiple-causes analysis showed that 5-HT1BR expression and sex were significant covariates of impulsivity. Males displayed increased impulsivity in both dimensions, whereas 5-HT1BR expression was a predictor of increased impulsive action only. These data support the conclusion that impulsive action and impulsive choice are distinct behavioral phenotypes with dissociable biological influences that can be modeled in mice.

While the majority of anxiety and depression-related research has focused on the 5-HT1A receptor, the 5-HT1B receptor has a lesser known role in modulating emotional behavior. 5-HT1B receptors are inhibitory GPCRs located on the presynaptic terminal of both serotonin and non-serotonin neurons, where they act to inhibit neurotransmitter release. The autoreceptor population located on the axon terminals of 5-HT neurons is a difficult population to study due to their diffuse localization throughout the brain that overlaps with 5-HT1B heteroreceptors (receptors located on non-serotonergic neurons). In order to study the contribution of 5-HT1B autoreceptors to anxiety and depression-related behaviors, we developed a genetic mouse model that allows for selective ablation of 5-HT1B autoreceptors.

Here for the first time, we have implemented this strategy to address the potential therapeutic value of a glutamate-based pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia involving inhibition of the glutamate recycling enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase. Mice constitutively heterozygous for GLS1, the gene encoding glutaminase, manifest a schizophrenia resilience phenotype, a key dimension of which is an attenuated locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. If resilience is due to glutaminase deficiency in adulthood, then glutaminase inhibitors should have therapeutic potential. However, this has been difficult to test given the dearth of neuroactive glutaminase inhibitors. So, we used genetic pharmacotherapy to ask whether adult induction of GLS1 heterozygosity would attenuate amphetamine responsiveness. We generated conditional floxGLS1 mice and crossed them with global CAG(ERT2cre\u2215+) mice to produce GLS1 iHET mice, susceptible to tamoxifen induction of GLS1 heterozygosity. One month after tamoxifen treatment of adult GLS1 iHET mice, we found a 50% reduction in GLS1 allelic abundance and glutaminase mRNA levels in the brain. While GLS1 iHET mice showed some recombination prior to tamoxifen, there was no impact on mRNA levels. We then asked whether induction of GLS heterozygosity would attenuate the locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. Before tamoxifen, control and GLS1 iHET mice did not differ in their response to amphetamine. One month after tamoxifen treatment, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was blocked in GLS1 iHET mice. The block was largely maintained after 5 months. Thus, a genetically induced glutaminase reduction-mimicking pharmacological inhibition-strongly attenuated the response to a propsychotic challenge, suggesting that glutaminase may be a novel target for the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. These results demonstrate how genetic pharmacotherapy can be implemented to test a CNS target in advance of the development of specific neuroactive inhibitors.

The influence of Zn on agonist binding to 5-HT1ARs stably expressed in HEK293 cells was investigated by in vitro radioligand binding methods using the agonist [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. The in vivo effects of Zn were compared with those of 8-OH-DPAT in hypothermia, lower lip retraction (LLR), 5-HT behavioural syndrome and the forced swim (FST) tests. In the in vitro studies, biphasic effects, which involved allosteric potentiation of agonist binding at sub-micromolar Zn concentrations and inhibition at sub-millimolar Zn concentrations, were found. The in vivo studies showed that Zn did not induce LLR or elements of 5-HT behavioural syndrome but blocked such effects induced by 8-OH-DPAT. Zn decreased body temperature in rats and mice; however, Zn failed to induce hypothermia in the 5-HT1A autoreceptor knockout mice. In the FST, Zn potentiated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. However, in the FST performed with the 5-HT1A autoreceptor knockout mice, the anti-immobility effect of Zn was partially blocked.

However, it is unclear how these cells mediate memory discrimination. Excitability is enhanced in maturing adult-born neurons, spurring the hypothesis that the activity of these cells \"directly\" encodes and stores memories. An alternative hypothesis posits that maturing neurons \"indirectly\" contribute to memory encoding by regulating excitation-inhibition balance. We evaluated these alternatives by using dentate-sensitive active place avoidance tasks to assess experience-dependent changes in dentate field potentials in the presence and absence of neurogenesis. Before training, X-ray ablation of adult neurogenesis-reduced dentate responses to perforant-path stimulation and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward. These differences were unchanged after place avoidance training with the shock zone in the initial location, which both groups learned to avoid equally well. In contrast, sham-treated mice decreased dentate responses and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward after the shock zone was relocated, whereas X-irradiated mice failed to show these changes in dentate function and were impaired on this test of memory discrimination. During place avoidance, excitation-inhibition coupled neural synchrony in dentate local field potentials was reduced in X-irradiated mice, especially in the \u03b8 band. The difference was most prominent during conflict learning, which is impaired in the X-irradiated mice. These findings indicate that maturing adult-born neurons regulate both functional network plasticity in response to memory discrimination and dentate excitation-inhibition coordination.

Evidence from patterns of brain expression and initial pharmacologic studies led us to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to examine the influence of altered 5-HT1B receptor activity on hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Heterozygous 5-HT1B KO and pharmacologic 5-HT1B antagonism both attenuated locomotor hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Furthermore, DAT KO mice with reduced, but not eliminated, 5-HT1B receptor expression regained cocaine-stimulated locomotion, which was absent in DAT KO mice with normal levels of 5-HT1B receptor expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the degree of habituation to the testing apparatus determined whether cocaine had no effect on locomotion in DAT KO or reduced locomotion, helping to resolve differences among prior reports.

However, similar to most antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suffer from two major problems: They only show beneficial effects after 2 to 4 weeks and only about 33% of patients show remission to first-line treatment. Thus, there is a considerable need for development of more effective antidepressants.

Originally, adult-born neurons were considered to have excitatory effects on the DG network, but recent studies suggest a net inhibitory effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that selective removal of newborn neurons would lead to increased susceptibility to the effects of a convulsant. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating the response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid (KA) in mice with reduced adult neurogenesis, produced either by focal X-irradiation of the DG, or by pharmacogenetic deletion of dividing radial glial precursors. In the first 4 hrs after KA administration, when mice have the most robust seizures, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis had more severe convulsive seizures, exhibited either as a decreased latency to the first convulsive seizure, greater number of convulsive seizures, or longer convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures did not appear to change or they decreased. Four-21 hrs after KA injection, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis showed more interictal spikes (IIS) and delayed seizures than controls. Effects were greater when the anticonvulsant ethosuximide was injected 30 min prior to KA administration; ethosuximide allows forebrain seizure activity to be more easily examined in mice by suppressing seizures dominated by the brainstem.

Here we devise genetic strategies that demonstrate that a stereotyped neural circuit that transmits information from the olfactory bulb to cortical amygdala is necessary for innate aversive and appetitive behaviours. Moreover, we use the promoter of the activity-dependent gene arc to express the photosensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, in neurons of the cortical amygdala activated by odours that elicit innate behaviours.

This led to the theory that depression results from impaired adult neurogenesis and restoration of adult neurogenesis leads to recovery. Follow up studies yielded a complex body of often inconsistent results, and the veracity of this theory is uncertain. We propose five criteria for acceptance of this theory, we review the recent evidence for each criterion, and we draw the following conclusions: Diverse animal models of depression and anxiety have impaired neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is consistently boosted by antidepressants in animal models only when animals are stressed. Ablation of neurogenesis in animal models impairs cognitive functions relevant to depression, but only a minority of studies find that ablation causes depression or anxiety.

However, local circuit-mechanisms by which adult-born neurons partake in this process are poorly understood. Computational, neuroanatomical and electrophysiological studies suggest that sparseness of activation in the granule cell layer (GCL) is conducive for pattern separation. A sparse coding scheme is thought to facilitate the distribution of similar entorhinal inputs across the GCL to decorrelate overlapping representations and minimize interference. Here we used fast voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging combined with laser photostimulation and electrical stimulation to examine how selectively increasing adult DG neurogenesis influences local circuit activity and excitability. We show that DG of mice with more adult-born neurons exhibits decreased strength of neuronal activation and more restricted excitation spread in GCL while maintaining effective output to CA3c. Conversely, blockade of adult hippocampal neurogenesis changed excitability of the DG in the opposite direction. Analysis of GABAergic inhibition onto mature dentate granule neurons in the DG of mice with more adult-born neurons shows a modest readjustment of perisomatic inhibitory synaptic gain without changes in overall inhibitory tone, presynaptic properties or GABAergic innervation pattern. Retroviral labeling of connectivity in mice with more adult-born neurons showed increased number of excitatory synaptic contacts of adult-born neurons onto hilar interneurons. Together, these studies demonstrate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis modifies excitability of mature dentate granule neurons and that this non-cell autonomous effect may be mediated by local circuit mechanisms such as excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons.

Since 60% of depressed patients do not respond adequately to medication or are resistant to ADs, it is imperative to delineate more accurate biomarkers. Recent clinical studies suggest that \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels in human mononuclear leukocytes may be an efficient biomarker. If potential biomarkers such as \u03b2-arrestin 1 could be assessed from a source such as peripheral blood cells, then they could be easily monitored and used to predict therapeutic responses. However, no previous studies have measured \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in anxious/depressive rodents.

Interestingly, PBMCs from anxious/depressed mice showed significantly reduced \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels.

The results suggest that isolation of PBMCs from mice by submandibular bleeding is a useful technique to screen putative biomarkers of the pathophysiology of mood disorders and the response to ADs.

Previous studies have shown that knockout of 5-HT1A selectively in the raphe leads to higher levels of anxiety during adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether this phenotype is due to variation in receptor levels specifically during development or throughout life. To test the hypothesis that developmental sensitivity may underlie the effects of 5-HT1A on anxiety, we used an inducible transgenic system to selectively suppress 5-HT1A levels in serotonergic raphe neurons from post-natal days (P) 14 to P30, with a maximal reduction of 40% at P21 and return to regular levels by P30. This developmental decrease in receptor levels has long-lasting consequences, increasing anxiety and decreasing social investigation in adulthood. In addition, post-natal knockdown of autoreceptors leads to long-term increases in the excitability of serotonergic neurons, which may represent a mechanism underlying the effects of post-natal receptor variation on behavior later in life. Finally, we also examined the interplay between receptor variation and juvenile exposure to stress (applied from P14 to P21). Similar to receptor knockdown, juvenile exposure to stress led to increased anxiety phenotypes but did not exacerbate 5-HT1A knockdown-mediated anxiety levels. This work indicates that the effects of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on anxiety and social behaviors are developmentally mediated and suggests that natural variations in the expression of 5-HT1A may act during development to influence individual anxiety levels and contribute to susceptibility to anxiety disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Anxiety Disorders", "Autoreceptors", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred CBA", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zoe R", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Piel", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tabia L", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Barnard College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Richardson-Jones", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheryl G", "Last Name": "Beck", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frances A", "Last Name": "Champagne", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "23746833", "Title": "(Radio)active neurogenesis in the human hippocampus.", "Abstract": "Fifteen years ago, the generation of new neurons in adulthood was documented in the human hippocampus, but lingering questions have remained about the extent of this process.

We conditionally removed both genes in postmitotic mDA neurons using the dopamine transporter-cre mouse. Deletion of both Foxa1 and Foxa2 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive mDA neurons. The decrease was predominantly observed in the substantia nigra region of the mDA system, which led to a loss of TH+ fibers innervating the striatum. Further analysis demonstrated that the reduction in the number of TH+ cells in the mutant mice was not due to apoptosis or cell-fate change. Using reporter mouse lines, we found that the mDA neurons were still present in the ventral midbrain, but that they had lost much of their dopaminergic phenotype. The majority of these neurons remained in the ventral mesencephalon until at least 18 months of age. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that the loss of the mDA phenotype is due to a reduction in the binding of the nuclear orphan receptor, Nurr-1 to the promoter region of TH.

Integral to its pleiotropic actions is the existence of multiple receptors, expressed in distinct but often overlapping patterns within the brain and the periphery. The existence of \u223c14 mammalian receptor subtypes, many of which possess similar pharmacological profiles, has made assigning functional roles for these receptors challenging. This challenge has been further compounded by the revelation that a single receptor can have several different functions depending upon where and when it is expressed and activated, that is, in brain versus periphery, or at different developmental time points. This review highlights the contribution of genetic techniques to dissect the specific function of distinct serotonin receptor populations across the life course, with an emphasis on the contribution of different serotonin 1A receptor populations to mood and behavior. Similar approaches hold the promise to elucidate the functional roles of other receptors, as well as the interaction of serotonin with other neuroendocrine modulators of mood and behavior.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Affect", "Animals", "Behavior", "Brain", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zoe R", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. zoe.donaldson@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Katherine M", "Last Name": "Nautiyal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susanne E", "Last Name": "Ahmari", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current opinion in neurobiology", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23380665", "Title": "Neuronal plasticity and antidepressant actions.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel experiences.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Affect", "Animals", "Antidepressive Agents", "Humans", "Nerve Net", "Neurogenesis", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eero", "Last Name": "Castr\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Center, University of Helsinki, P.O.

We hypothesize that it may be related to fewer granule neurons (GN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), a defect possibly reversible with antidepressants. We studied age-, sex-, and postmortem interval-matched groups: no major psychopathology (controls); unmedicated-MDD; and MDD treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (MDD*SSRI) or tricyclics (MDD*TCA). Frozen right hippocampi were fixed, sectioned (50\u2009\u03bcm), immunostained with neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN), and counterstained with hematoxylin. GN and glial number, and DG and granule cell layer (GCL) volumes were stereologically estimated. Fewer GNs in the anterior DG were present in unmedicated-MDDs compared with controls (p=0.013). Younger age of MDD onset correlated with fewer GNs (p=0.021). Unmedicated-MDDs had fewer mid-DG GNs than MDD*SSRIs (p=0.028) and controls (p=0.032). Anterior GCL glial number did not differ between groups. Anterior/mid GCL volume was smaller in unmedicated-MDDs vs controls (p=0.008) and larger in MDD*SSRIs vs unmedicated-MDDs (p<0.001), MDD*TCAs (p<0.001), and controls (p<0.001). Anterior GCL volume and GN number (r=0.594, p=0.001), and mid DG volume and GN number (r=0.398, p=0.044) were correlated. Anterior DG capillary density correlated with GN number (p=0.027), and with GCL (p=0.024) and DG (r=0.400, p=0.047) volumes. Posterior DG volume and GN number did not differ between groups. Fewer GNs in unmedicated-MDD without fewer neuronal progenitor cells, as previously reported, suggests a cell maturation or survival defect, perhaps related to MDD duration. This may contribute to a smaller hippocampus and is potentially reversed by SSRIs.

Our in vitro data indicated that 5-HT(4)R endogenously expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) may promote angiogenesis. Inhibition of the receptor with 5-HT(4)R antagonist RS 39604 reduced EC capillary tube formation in the reconstituted basement membrane. Using Boyden chamber migration assay and wound healing \"scratch\" assay, we demonstrated that RS 39604 treatment significantly suppressed EC migration. Transendothelial resistance measurement and immunofluorescence analysis showed that a 5-HT(4)R agonist RS 67333 led to an increase in endothelial permeability, actin stress fiber and interendothelial gap formation. Importantly, we provided the evidence that 5-HT(4)R-regulated EC migration may be mediated by G\u03b113 and RhoA.
