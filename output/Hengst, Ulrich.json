Despite these difficulties, genomics and related disciplines are allowing fundamental mechanistic insights to emerge with clarity, particularly with the introduction of high-resolution sequencing technologies. After all, the disrupted processes at the interface between DNA and gene expression, which we call the broken AD genome, offer detailed quantitative evidence unrestrained by preconceived notions about the disease. In addition to highlighting biological pathways beyond the classical pathology hallmarks, these advances have revitalized drug discovery efforts and are driving improvements in clinical tools. We review genetic, epigenomic, and gene expression findings related to AD pathogenesis and explore how their integration enables a better understanding of the multicellular imbalances contributing to this heterogeneous condition.

The oncogenic potential of tumorigenesis, which is highly contingent on cap-dependent eIF4E, also arises from the critical role in the nuclear export and cytosolic translation of oncogenic transcripts. Inhibition of Exportin1 (XPO1), which is the major nuclear export protein for eIF4E-bound oncoprotein mRNAs, results in decreased tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that eIF4E is critical in multiple myeloma. Indeed, we found that eIF4E is overexpressed in myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells compared with normal plasma cells. Although stable overexpression of eIF4E in multiple myeloma cells significantly increases tumorigenesis, knockdown of eIF4E impairs multiple myeloma tumor progression in a human xenograft mouse model. Using a tet-on-inducible eIF4E-knockdown system, eIF4E downregulation blocks multiple myeloma tumor growth in vivo, correlating with decreased eIF4E expression. Further overexpression and knockdown of eIF4E revealed that eIF4E regulates translation of mRNAs with highly complex 5'-untranslated regions, such as c-MYC and C/EBP\u03b2, and subsequently proliferation in multiple myeloma cells, but not in nonmalignant bone marrow stromal cells. Because many transcription factors that are critical for multiple myeloma proliferation exhibit a higher dependency on protein translation, eIF4E is an ideal and selective tool to target multiple myeloma cell growth.

A key neuropathological feature of the disease is the over-production of amyloid-beta and the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques in brain regions of the afflicted individuals. Throughout the years scientists have generated numerous Alzheimer's disease mouse models that attempt to replicate the amyloid-beta pathology. Unfortunately, the mouse models only selectively mimic the disease features. Neuronal death, a prominent effect in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is noticeably lacking in these mice. Hence, we and others have employed a method of directly infusing soluble oligomeric species of amyloid-beta - forms of amyloid-beta that have been proven to be most toxic to neurons - stereotaxically into the brain. In this report we utilize male C57BL/6J mice to document this surgical technique of increasing amyloid-beta levels in a select brain region. The infusion target is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus because this brain structure, along with the basal forebrain that is connected by the cholinergic circuit, represents one of the areas of degeneration in the disease. The results of elevating amyloid-beta in the dentate gyrus via stereotaxic infusion reveal increases in neuron loss in the dentate gyrus within 1 week, while there is a concomitant increase in cell death and cholinergic neuron loss in the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca of the basal forebrain. These effects are observed up to 2 weeks. Our data suggests that the current amyloid-beta infusion model provides an alternative mouse model to address region specific neuron death in a short-term basis. The advantage of this model is that amyloid-beta can be elevated in a spatial and temporal manner.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Peptide Fragments", "Stereotaxic Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying Y", "Last Name": "Jean", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; yyj2103@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jimena", "Last Name": "Baleriola", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "F\u00e0", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Hengst", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center; Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2015Jun17"}, {"PMID": "26131922", "Title": "Detection of Axonally Localized mRNAs in Brain Sections Using High-Resolution In Situ Hybridization.", "Abstract": "mRNAs are frequently localized to vertebrate axons and their local translation is required for axon pathfinding or branching during development and for maintenance, repair or neurodegeneration in postdevelopmental periods. High throughput analyses have recently revealed that axons have a more dynamic and complex transcriptome than previously expected. These analysis, however have been mostly done in cultured neurons where axons can be isolated from the somato-dendritic compartments. It is virtually impossible to achieve such isolation in whole tissues in vivo. Thus, in order to verify the recruitment of mRNAs and their functional relevance in a whole animal, transcriptome analyses should ideally be combined with techniques that allow the visualization of mRNAs in situ. Recently, novel ISH technologies that detect RNAs at a single-molecule level have been developed. This is especially important when analyzing the subcellular localization of mRNA, since localized RNAs are typically found at low levels. Here we describe two protocols for the detection of axonally-localized mRNAs using a novel ultrasensitive RNA ISH technology.

Here we show that local protein synthesis and degradation are linked events in growth cones. We find that growth cones exhibit high levels of ubiquitination and that local signalling pathways trigger the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA, a mediator of Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Inhibition of RhoA degradation is sufficient to remove the protein-synthesis requirement for Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. In addition to RhoA, we find that locally translated proteins are the main targets of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in growth cones.

During the development of the nervous system intra-axonal protein synthesis is crucial for the establishment of neuronal connections. In contrast, mature axons have long been considered as translationally inactive but upon nerve injury or under neurodegenerative conditions specific subsets of mRNAs are recruited into axons and locally translated. Intra-axonally synthesized proteins can have pathogenic or restorative and regenerative functions, and thus targeting the axonal translatome might have therapeutic value, for example in the treatment of spinal cord injury or Alzheimer's disease. In the case of Alzheimer's disease the local synthesis of the stress response transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 mediates the long-range retrograde spread of pathology across the brain, and inhibition of local Atf4 translation downstream of the integrated stress response might interfere with this spread. Several molecular tools and approaches have been developed to target specifically the axonal translatome by either overexposing proteins locally in axons or, conversely, knocking down selectively axonally localized mRNAs. Many questions about axonal translation remain to be answered, especially with regard to the mechanisms establishing specificity but, nevertheless, targeting the axonal translatome is a promising novel avenue to pursue in the development for future therapies for various neurological conditions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Humans", "Nerve Degeneration", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Protein Biosynthesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jimena", "Last Name": "Baleriola", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, 650 W. 168th St., New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Hengst", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "PubDate": "2015Jan"}, {"PMID": "25171414", "Title": "Axonally synthesized ATF4 transmits a neurodegenerative signal across brain regions.", "Abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, exposure of axons to A\u03b2 causes pathogenic changes that spread retrogradely by unknown mechanisms, affecting the entire neuron.
