Here we present the results of electrophysiological recordings of single units maintained over weeks to examine the stability of odour-evoked responses in mouse piriform cortex. Although activity in piriform cortex could be used to discriminate between odorants at any moment in time, odour-evoked responses drifted over periods of days to weeks.

Daily exposure to the same odorant slowed the rate of drift, but when exposure was halted the rate increased again.

This odor response is driven by direct input from the olfactory bulb, but is also shaped by a dense network of associative or intracortical inputs to piriform, which may enhance or constrain the cortical odor representation. With optogenetic techniques, it is possible to functionally isolate defined inputs to piriform cortex and assess their potential to activate or inhibit piriform pyramidal neurons. The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and sends an associative projection to piriform cortex that has potential roles in the state-dependent processing of olfactory behaviors. Here, we provide a detailed functional assessment of the AON afferents to piriform in male and female C57Bl/6J mice. We confirm that the AON forms glutamatergic excitatory synapses onto piriform pyramidal neurons; and while these inputs are not as strong as piriform recurrent collaterals, they are less constrained by disynaptic inhibition. Moreover, AON-to-piriform synapses contain a substantial NMDAR-mediated current that prolongs the synaptic response at depolarized potentials. These properties of limited inhibition and slow NMDAR-mediated currents result in strong temporal summation of AON inputs within piriform pyramidal neurons, and suggest that the AON could powerfully enhance activation of piriform neurons in response to odor.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Odor information is transmitted from olfactory receptors to olfactory bulb, and then to piriform cortex, where ensembles of activated neurons form neural representations of the odor. While these ensembles are driven by primary bulbar afferents, and shaped by intracortical recurrent connections, the potential for another early olfactory area, the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), to contribute to piriform activity is not known. Here, we use optogenetic circuit-mapping methods to demonstrate that AON inputs can significantly activate piriform neurons, as they are coupled to NMDAR currents and to relatively modest disynaptic inhibition. The AON may enhance the piriform odor response, encouraging further study to determine the states or behaviors through which AON potentiates the cortical response to odor.", "Keywords": ["anterior olfactory cortex", "anterior olfactory nucleus", "associational synapses", "intracortical synapses", "olfactory cortex", "piriform cortex"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Glutamic Acid", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons, Afferent", "Odorants", "Olfactory Bulb", "Olfactory Cortex", "Optogenetics", "Piriform Cortex", "Pyramidal Cells", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Smell", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marco J", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Franks", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Roxanne", "Last Name": "Oghaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Axel", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Neural representations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli therefore ultimately connect to US-responsive cells in the BLA to elicit both innate and learned responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Appetitive Behavior", "Basolateral Nuclear Complex", "Behavior, Animal", "Conditioning, Classical", "Learning", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Reward"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Felicity", "Last Name": "Gore", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edmund C", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baylor C", "Last Name": "Brangers", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Aladi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Stujenske", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ekaterina", "Last Name": "Likhtik", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marco J", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "C Daniel", "Last Name": "Salzman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell-MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations.

The neural circuits that convey olfactory information from the sense organ to the cortical and subcortical olfactory centres have been anatomically defined, but the specific pathways responsible for innate responses to volatile odours have not been identified. Here we devise genetic strategies that demonstrate that a stereotyped neural circuit that transmits information from the olfactory bulb to cortical amygdala is necessary for innate aversive and appetitive behaviours. Moreover, we use the promoter of the activity-dependent gene arc to express the photosensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, in neurons of the cortical amygdala activated by odours that elicit innate behaviours. Optical activation of these neurons leads to appropriate behaviours that recapitulate the responses to innate odours. These data indicate that the cortical amygdala plays a critical role in generating innate odour-driven behaviours but do not preclude its participation in learned olfactory behaviours.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amygdala", "Animals", "Behavior", "Learning", "Mice", "Neurons", "Odorants", "Olfactory Bulb", "Olfactory Pathways", "Olfactory Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cory M", "Last Name": "Root", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Denny", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biological Sciences, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA [3] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA [3] Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Axel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Nov13"}, {"PMID": "25043419", "Title": "Identifying functional connections of the inner photoreceptors in Drosophila using Tango-Trace.", "Abstract": "In Drosophila, the four inner photoreceptor neurons exhibit overlapping but distinct spectral sensitivities and mediate behaviors that reflect spectral preference. We developed a genetic strategy, Tango-Trace, that has permitted the identification of the connections of the four chromatic photoreceptors. Each of the four stochastically distributed chromatic photoreceptor subtypes make distinct connections in the medulla with four different TmY cells. Moreover, each class of TmY cells forms a retinotopic map in both the medulla and the lobula complex, generating four overlapping topographic maps that could carry different color information. Thus, the four inner photoreceptors transmit spectral information through distinct channels that may converge in both the medulla and lobula complex.

The glomerular inputs to individual Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning, anatomic features or developmental origins.
