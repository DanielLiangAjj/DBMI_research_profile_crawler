Disease-causing JAK1 gain-of-function (GoF) mutations are considered exceedingly rare and have been identified in only four families. Here, we use forward and reverse genetics to identify 59 individuals harboring one of four heterozygous JAK1 variants. In vitro and ex vivo analysis of these variants revealed hyperactive baseline and cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) levels compared with wild-type JAK1. A systematic review of electronic health records from the BioME Biobank revealed increased likelihood of clinical presentation with autoimmunity, atopy, colitis, and/or dermatitis in JAK1 variant-positive individuals. Finally, treatment of one affected patient with severe atopic dermatitis using the JAK1/JAK2-selective inhibitor, baricitinib, resulted in clinically significant improvement. These findings suggest that individually rare JAK1 GoF variants may underlie an emerging syndrome with more common presentations of autoimmune and inflammatory disease (JAACD syndrome). More broadly, individuals who present with such conditions may benefit from genetic testing for the presence of JAK1 GoF variants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Autoimmunity", "Colitis",

individual's major clinical immunodeficiency derives from abnormal NK cells and is associated with several genetic etiologies. Three categories of \u03b2-actin-related diseases with over 60 ACTB (\u03b2-actin) variants have previously been identified, none with a distinct NK cell phenotype. An individual with mild developmental delay, macrothrombocytopenia, and susceptibility to infections, molluscum contagiosum virus, and EBV-associated lymphoma had functional NKD for over a decade. A de novo ACTB variant encoding G342D \u03b2-actin was identified and was consistent with the individual's developmental and platelet phenotype. This novel variant also was found to have direct impact in NK cells because its expression in the human NK cell line YTS (YTS-NKD) caused increased cell spreading in lytic immune synapses created on activating surfaces. YTS-NKD cells were able to degranulate and perform cytotoxicity, but they demonstrated defective serial killing because of prolonged conjugation to the killed target cell and thus were effectively unable to terminate lytic synapses. G342D \u03b2-actin results in a novel, to our knowledge, mechanism of functional NKD via increased synaptic spreading and defective lytic synapse termination with resulting impaired serial killing, leading to overall reductions in NK cell cytotoxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Actins", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Cell Line", "Blood Platelets", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abigail E", "Last Name": "Reed", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jackeline", "Last Name": "Peraza", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College of Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Frederique", "Last Name": "van den Haak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Evelyn R", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "Ivan K", "Last Name": "Chinn", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Allergy and Retrovirology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Human Genome Sequencing Center, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "Enrica", "Last Name": "Marchi", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, NCI Designated Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Bachir", "Last Name": "Alobeid", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2024Mar15"}, {"PMID": "38278184", "Title": "Validating inborn error of immunity prevalence and risk with nationally representative electronic health record data.", "Abstract": "The 10 Warning Signs of Primary Immunodeficiency were created 30 years ago to advance recognition of inborn errors of immunity (IEI).

In this case report, we present the coexistence of Artemis deficiency (OMIM 602450) and Three M (3M) syndrome (OMIM 273750). A 10-months-old male patient with neuromotor developmental delay was evaluated for immunodeficiency due to recurrent respiratory infections diarrhea and oral moniliasis from the age of 1.5 months. He had facial dysmorphism with rotated ears, flat nose and hypertelorism. Neurological examination revealed generalized hypotonia and mental motor delay. Immunological screening of the patient demonstrated mild lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, reduced number of CD3+ T cells (980 cells/mm3) and CD19+ B cells (35 cells/mm3). He was diagnosed with leaky T-B-NK+ SCID. Exome sequence analysis showed the presence of a homozygous pathogenic DCLRE1C variant [c.194C\u2009>\u2009T; p.T65I (NM_001033855)] and a homozygous pathogenic variant in OBSL1, a gene associated with 3M syndrome [c.3922C\u2009>\u2009T; p.R1308X (NM_001173431)].

However, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited by the adverse tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions, most notably that acidity inhibits T and natural killer (NK) cell mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and impairs cytotoxicity. In several reported studies, systemic buffering of tumor acidity enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Paradoxically, we found in a c-Myc-driven hepatocellular carcinoma model that systemic buffering increased tumor mTORC1 activity, negating inhibition of tumor growth by anti-PD1 treatment. Therefore, in this proof-of-concept study, we tested the metabolic engineering of immune effector cells to mitigate the inhibitory effect of tumor acidity while avoiding side effects associated with systemic buffering. We first overexpressed an activated RHEB in the human NK cell line NK-92, thereby rescuing acid-blunted mTORC1 activity and enhancing cytolytic activity. Then, to directly mitigate the effect of acidity, we ectopically expressed acid extruder proteins. Whereas ectopic expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) moderately increased mTORC1 activity, it did not enhance effector function. In contrast, overexpressing a constitutively active Na+/H+-exchanger 1 (NHE1; SLC9A1) in NK-92 did not elevate mTORC1 but enhanced degranulation, target engagement, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo antitumor activity.

Perforin creates pores in target cell membranes allowing delivery of proapoptotic enzymes. Despite the fact that secreted perforin is in close range to both the NK and target cell membranes, the NK cell typically survives while the target cell does not. How NK cells preferentially avoid death during the secretion of perforin via the degranulation of their perforin-containing organelles (lytic granules) is perplexing. Here, we demonstrate that NK cells are protected from perforin-mediated autolysis by densely packed and highly ordered presynaptic lipid membranes, which increase packing upon synapse formation. When treated with 7-ketocholesterol, lipid packing is reduced in NK cells making them susceptible to perforin-mediated lysis after degranulation. Using high-resolution imaging and lipidomics, we identified lytic granules themselves as having endogenously densely packed lipid membranes. During degranulation, lytic granule-cell membrane fusion thereby further augments presynaptic membrane packing, enhancing membrane protection at the specific sites where NK cells would face maximum concentrations of secreted perforin. Additionally, we found that an aggressive breast cancer cell line is perforin resistant and evades NK cell-mediated killing owing to a densely packed postsynaptic membrane. By disrupting membrane packing, these cells were switched to an NK-susceptible state, which could suggest strategies for improving cytotoxic cell-based cancer therapies. Thus, lipid membranes serve an unexpected role in NK cell functionality protecting them from autolysis, while degranulation allows for the inherent lytic granule membrane properties to create local ordered lipid \"shields\" against self-destruction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Degranulation", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Ketocholesterols", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Membrane Lipids", "Perforin", "Primary Cell Culture"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2021Aug"}, {"PMID": "34329649", "Title": "Genetic errors of immunity distinguish pediatric nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders.", "Abstract": "Pediatric nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders (PLPDs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous.

This gene encodes regulator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a member of a large family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that targets heterotrimeric G proteins to constrain the activity of G protein-coupled receptors, including receptors for chemoattractants. The affected individuals exhibited systemic abnormalities directly related to the RGS10 mutations, including recurrent infections, hypergammaglobulinemia, profoundly reduced lymphocyte chemotaxis, abnormal lymph node architecture, and short stature due to growth hormone deficiency. Although the GAP activity of each RGS10 variant was intact, each protein exhibited aberrant patterns of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and increased cytosolic and cell membrane localization and activity compared to the wild-type protein. We propose that the RGS10 p.E163del and p.A171S mutations lead to mislocalization of the RGS10 protein in the cytosol, thereby resulting in attenuated chemokine signaling.

intestines, kidneys and other tissues as well as non-epithelial cells including macrophages. LPI is caused by biallelic, pathogenic variants in SLC7A7. The clinical phenotype of LPI includes failure to thrive and multi-system disease including hematologic, neurologic, pulmonary and renal manifestations. Individual presentations are extremely variable, often leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Here we describe a patient that clinically presented with immune dysregulation in the setting of early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including renal involvement, in whom an LPI diagnosis was suspected post-mortem based on exome sequencing analysis. A review of the literature was performed to provide an overview of the clinical spectrum and immune mechanisms involved in this disease. The precise mechanism by which ineffective amino acid transport triggers systemic inflammatory features is not yet understood. However, LPI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early-onset SLE, particularly in the absence of response to immunosuppressive therapy.", "Keywords": ["case report", "hemophagocytic

To date, our knowledge about its effect on the human host remains limited. It is well known that host genetic factors account for the individual differences in the susceptibility to infectious diseases. The genetic susceptibility factors to COVID-19 and its severity are associated with several unanswered questions. However, the experience gained from an earlier strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, which shows 78% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and uses the same receptor to bind to host cells, could provide some clues. It, therefore, seems possible to assemble new evidence in order to solve a potential genetic predisposition puzzle for COVID-19.

Here, we describe compound heterozygous MCM10 variants in patients with distinctive, but overlapping, clinical phenotypes: natural killer (NK) cell deficiency (NKD) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) with hypoplasia of the spleen and thymus. To understand the mechanism of MCM10-associated disease, we modeled these variants in human cell lines. MCM10 deficiency causes chronic replication stress that reduces cell viability due to increased genomic instability and telomere erosion. Our data suggest that loss of MCM10 function constrains telomerase activity by accumulating abnormal replication fork structures enriched with single-stranded DNA. Terminally-arrested replication forks in MCM10-deficient cells require endonucleolytic processing by MUS81, as MCM10:MUS81 double mutants display decreased viability and accelerated telomere shortening. We propose that these bi-allelic variants in MCM10 predispose specific cardiac and immune cell lineages to prematurely arrest during differentiation, causing the clinical phenotypes observed in both NKD and RCM patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Cardiomyopathies", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line", "DNA Replication", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endonucleases", "Humans", "Killer

XLN patient NK and T cells had increased granzyme B content and elevated degranulation and IFN-\u03b3 production when compared with healthy control cells. Murine WASpL272P NK and T cells formed stable synapses with YAC-1 tumor cells and anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads, respectively. WASpL272P mouse T cells had normal degranulation and cytokine response whereas WASpL272P NK cells showed an enhanced response. Imaging experiments revealed that while WASpL272P CD8+ T cells had increased accumulation of actin upon TCR activation, WASpL272P NK cells had normal actin accumulation at lytic synapses triggered through NKp46 signaling but had impaired response to lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 engagement.

In this Perspectives article, we leverage the unique expertise of our workgroup to address concerns of physician-scientist trainees and to provide suggestions on how to navigate career trajectories in the post-COVID-19 era. We identified and addressed four major areas of concern: lack of in-person conferences and the associated decrease access to mentors and networking activities, decreased academic productivity, diminished job prospects, and mental health challenges.

immunity that lead to impaired NK cell development, function, or both. Through the understanding of the biological perturbations in individuals with NKD, requirements for the generation of terminally mature functional innate effector cells can be elucidated. Here, we report a cause of NKD resulting from compound heterozygous mutations in minichromosomal maintenance complex member 10 (MCM10) that impaired NK cell maturation in a child with fatal susceptibility to CMV. MCM10 has not been previously associated with monogenic disease and plays a critical role in the activation and function of the eukaryotic DNA replisome. Through evaluation of patient primary fibroblasts, modeling patient mutations in fibroblast cell lines, and MCM10 knockdown in human NK cell lines, we have shown that loss of MCM10 function leads to impaired cell cycle progression and induction of DNA damage-response pathways. By modeling MCM10 deficiency in primary NK cell precursors, including patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we further demonstrated that MCM10 is required for NK cell terminal maturation and acquisition of immunological system function. Together, these data define MCM10 as an NKD gene and provide biological insight into the requirement for the DNA replisome in human NK cell maturation and function.", "Keywords": ["Genetic diseases",

However, limited information exists regarding whether encounters between innate cells direct the generation of specialized T-cell subsets. We aim to understand how natural killer (NK) cells modulate cell-mediated immunity in humans. We found that human CD14+CD16- monocytes that differentiate into inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) are shaped at the early stages of differentiation by cell-to-cell interactions with NK cells. Although a fraction of monocytes is eliminated by NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the polarization of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) at the NKp30-stabilized synapses triggers a stable IFN-\u03b3 signature in surviving monocytes that persists after their differentiation into DCs. Notably, NK-cell-instructed DCs drive the priming of type 17 CD8+ T cells (Tc17) with the capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 and interleukin-17A. Compared with healthy donors, this cellular network is impaired in patients with classical NK-cell deficiency driven by mutations in the GATA2 gene.

S703I JAK1 is not only hypermorphic for cytokine signaling but also neomorphic, as it enables signaling cascades not canonically mediated by JAK1.

such as autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, or atopy, but this coincidence is rarely understood on a molecular level. We describe five patients from four families with immunodeficiency coupled with atopy, lymphoproliferation, and cytokine overproduction harboring mutations in NCKAP1L, which encodes the hematopoietic-specific HEM1 protein. These mutations cause the loss of the HEM1 protein and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) or disrupt binding to the WRC regulator, Arf1, thereby impairing actin polymerization, synapse formation, and immune cell migration. Diminished cortical actin networks caused by WRC loss led to uncontrolled cytokine release and immune hyperresponsiveness. HEM1 loss also blocked mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent AKT phosphorylation, T cell proliferation, and selected effector functions, leading to immunodeficiency. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved HEM1 protein simultaneously regulates filamentous actin (F-actin) and mTORC2 signaling to achieve equipoise in immune responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1", "Actins", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Lymphoproliferative Disorders", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2", "Membrane Proteins", "Pedigree", "Phosphorylation", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Molecular Development of the Immune System Section, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, and Clinical Genomics Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "William A", "Last Name": "Comrie", "Affiliation": "Molecular Development of the Immune System Section, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, and Clinical Genomics Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Cecilia", "Last Name": "Poli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan", "Last Name": "Similuk", "Affiliation": "Division of Intramural Research, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Oler", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aiman J", "Last Name": "Faruqi", "Affiliation": "Molecular Development of the Immune System Section, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, and Clinical Genomics Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Douglas B", "Last Name": "Kuhns", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Roy J.

We identified a CVID+AIC patient who displays a rare homozygous missense M466V mutation in \u03b2-catenin-like protein 1 (CTNNBL1). Because CTNNBL1 binds activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that catalyzes SHM, we tested AID interactions with the CTNNBL1 M466V variant. We found that the M466V mutation interfered with the association of CTNNBL1 with AID, resulting in decreased AID in the nuclei of patient EBV-transformed B cell lines and of CTNNBL1 466V/V Ramos B cells engineered to express only CTNNBL1 M466V using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. As a consequence, the scarce IgG+ memory B cells from the CTNNBL1 466V/V patient showed a low SHM frequency that averaged 6.7 mutations compared with about 18 mutations per clone in healthy-donor counterparts. In addition, CTNNBL1 466V/V Ramos B cells displayed a decreased incidence of SHM that was reduced by half compared with parental WT Ramos B cells, demonstrating that the CTNNBL1 M466V mutation is responsible for defective SHM induction.

Patients with a suspected PI, but without a genetic diagnosis, commonly undergo a diagnostic odyssey that is costly, time-consuming, and arduous. This delay in diagnosis prevents appropriate disease management and treatment, contributing to prolonged suffering and decreased quality of life. Although next generation sequencing (NGS) can provide these patients with relief from such a diagnostic odyssey, it is often unavailable, mainly due to cost and inaccessibility. In January 2019, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) launched a free genetic sequencing pilot program for Jeffrey Modell Centers Network (JMCN) patients clinically diagnosed with an underlying PI. A total of 21 sites within the JMCN were invited to participate. JMF collaborated with Invitae, and testing was comprised of Invitae's Primary Immunodeficiency Panel, which currently includes 207 genes. A questionnaire was disseminated to each participating physician to evaluate barriers to access to genetic sequencing and changes in disease management and treatment after testing. One hundred fifty-eight patients and 29 family members were tested in this pilot study. Twenty-one percent of patients with a suspected monogenic disorder received a molecular diagnosis, and others received potentially useful diagnostic leads. Based on the results of genetic sequencing, clinical diagnosis was altered in 45% of patients, disease management was altered in 40%, treatment was altered in 36%, and genetic counseling was altered in 62%. The results of this pilot program demonstrate the utility, cost-efficiency, and critical importance of NGS for PI and make the case for broad scale sequence-based diagnostics for PI patients when

screening: saving lives\u2026one at a time.", "Abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of syndromes resulting from genetic defects causing severe deficiency in T cell and B cell function. These conditions are life-threatening and result in susceptibility to serious infections. SCID is often fatal in the first year of life if not detected and properly treated. SCID and related T cell lymphopenias can be detected in newborns by a simple screening test, the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay, using the same dried blood spot samples already collected from newborns to screen for other genetic disorders. The TREC assay facilitates the earliest possible identification of cases of SCID before opportunistic infections, irreversible organ damage, or death, thus allowing for the possibility of curative treatment through hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy. Infants receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the first few months of life, after being identified through screening, have a high probability of survival (95-100%), along with lower morbidity. The TREC assay has proven to have outstanding specificity and sensitivity to accurately identify almost all infants with SCID (the primary targets) as well as additional infants having other select immunologic abnormalities (secondary targets). The TREC assay is inexpensive and has been effectively integrated into many public health programs. Without timely treatment, SCID is a fatal disease that causes accrual of exorbitant healthcare costs even in just 1\u00a0year of life. The cost of care for just one infant with SCID, not diagnosed through newborn screening, could be more than the cost of screening for an entire state or regional population. Continued implementation of TREC screening will undoubtedly enhance early diagnosis, application of treatment, and healthcare cost savings. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation helped initiate newborn screening for SCID in the USA in 2008 and continues its efforts to advocate for SCID screening worldwide. Today, all 50 states and Puerto Rico are screening for SCID and T cell lymphopenia, with 27 million newborns screened to date, and hundreds diagnosed and treated. Additionally, there are at least 20 countries around the world currently conducting screening for SCID at various stages. Newborn screening for SCID and related T cell lymphopenia is cost-effective, and most importantly, it is lifesaving and allows children with SCID the opportunity to live a healthy life.", "Keywords": ["Awareness", "Diagnosis", "Education", "Immunology", "Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF)", "Newborn screening", "Primary immunodeficiency (PI)", "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)", "T cell lymphopenia", "Treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Early Diagnosis", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Lymphopenia", "Neonatal Screening", "Pathology, Molecular", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Jeffrey Modell Foundation, 780 Third Avenue, 47th Floor, New York City, NY, 10017, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Jeffrey Modell Foundation, 780 Third Avenue, 47th Floor, New York City, NY, 10017, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vicki", "Last Name": "Modell", "Affiliation": "Jeffrey Modell Foundation, 780 Third Avenue, 47th Floor, New York City, NY, 10017, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fred", "Last Name": "Modell", "Affiliation": "Jeffrey Modell Foundation, 780 Third Avenue, 47th Floor, New York City, NY, 10017, USA. fmodell@jmfworld.org."}], "Journal": "Immunologic research", "PubDate": "2020Feb"}, {"PMID": "31952801", "Title": "Membrane and Actin Tethering Transitions Help IQGAP1 Coordinate GTPase and Lipid Messenger Signaling.", "Abstract": "The coordination of lipid messenger signaling with cytoskeletal regulation is central to many organelle-specific regulatory processes. This coupling often depends on the function of multidomain scaffolds that orchestrate transient interactions among multiple signaling intermediates and regulatory proteins on organelles. The number of possible scaffold interaction partners and the ability for these interactions to occur at different timescales makes investigations of scaffold functions challenging. This work employs live cell imaging to probe how the multidomain scaffold IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) coordinates the activities of proteins affecting local actin polymerization, membrane processing, and phosphoinositide signaling. Using endosomes that are confined by a local actin network as a model system, we demonstrate that IQGAP1 can transition between different actin and endosomal membrane tethered states. Fast scaffold binding/disassociation transitions are shown to be driven by interactions between C-terminal scaffold domains and Rho GTPases at the membrane. Fluctuations in these binding modes are linked to negative regulation of actin polymerization. Although this control governs core elements of IQGAP1 dynamics, actin binding by the N-terminal calponin homology domain of the scaffold is shown to help the scaffold track the temporal development of endosome membrane markers, implying actin associations bolster membrane and actin coordination. Importantly, these effects are not easily distilled purely through standard (static) co-localization analyses or traditional pathway perturbations methods and were resolved by performing dynamic correlation and multiple regression analyses of IQGAP1 scaffold mutants. Using these capabilities with pharmacological inhibition, we provide evidence that membrane tethering\u00a0is dependent on the activities of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase in addition to the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. Overall, these methods and results point to a scaffold tethering mechanism that allows IQGAP1 to help control the amplitude of phosphoinositide lipid messenger signaling by coordinating signaling intermediate activities with the development and disassembly of local actin cytoskeletal networks.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Humans", "Lipids", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "ras GTPase-Activating Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholaus J", "Last Name": "Trenton", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "R Tyler", "Last Name": "McLaughlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Graduate Program in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Satya K", "Last Name": "Bellamkonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Tsao", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Rodzinski", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Volker", "Last Name": "Schweikhard", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Diehl", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Graduate Program in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, Texas.

Results of genetic testing can have a profound effect on clinical management decisions. Therefore clinical providers must demonstrate proficiency in interpreting genetic data. Because of the need for increased knowledge regarding this practice, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases Committee established a work group that reviewed and summarized information concerning appropriate methods, tools, and resources for evaluating variants identified by genetic testing. Strengths and limitations of tests frequently ordered by clinicians were examined. Summary statements and tables were then developed to guide the interpretation process.

Heterozygous C-terminal mutations in NFKB2 have been associated with early-onset common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), central adrenal insufficiency and ectodermal dysplasia. Only two previously reported cases have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and little is known about the role of NF-\u03baB2 in NK cell maturation and function. Here we report a 13-year-old female that presented at 6 years of age with a history of early onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections, progressive hair loss, and hypogamaglobulinemia consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CVID. At 9 years of age she had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia that responded to ganciclovir treatment. Functional NK cell testing demonstrated decreased NK cell cytotoxicity despite normal NK cell numbers, consistent with a greater susceptibility to systemic CMV infection. Research exome sequencing (ES) was performed and revealed a novel de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in NFKB2 (c.2611C>T, p.Gln871*) that was not carried by either of her parents. The variant was Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be de novo in the patient. At age 12, she presented with a reactivation of the systemic CMV infection that was associated with severe and progressive nephrotic syndrome with histologic evidence of pedicellar effacement and negative immunofluorescence. To our knowledge, this is the third NF-\u03baB2 deficient patient in which an abnormal NK cell function has been observed, suggesting a role for non-canonical NF-\u03baB2 signaling in NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell function should be assessed in patients with mutations in the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway to explore the risk for systemic viral infections that may lead to severe complications and impact patient survival. Similarly NF-\u03baB2 should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency who have aberrant NK cell function. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of NF-\u03baB2 in NK cell cytotoxic function.", "Keywords": ["NF-\u03baB2", "NK cell deficiency", "common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)",

One of the patients has been treated with CTLA-4-Ig and achieved sustained remission.

"Abstract": "Autosomal recessive IRF7 and IRF9 deficiencies impair type I and III IFN immunity and underlie severe influenza pneumonitis. We report three unrelated children with influenza A virus (IAV) infection manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (IAV-ARDS), heterozygous for rare TLR3 variants (P554S in two patients and P680L in the third) causing autosomal dominant (AD) TLR3 deficiency. AD TLR3 deficiency can underlie herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) by impairing cortical neuron-intrinsic type I IFN immunity to HSV-1. TLR3-mutated leukocytes produce normal levels of IFNs in response to IAV. In contrast, TLR3-mutated fibroblasts produce lower levels of IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb, and display enhanced viral susceptibility, upon IAV infection. Moreover, the patients' iPSC-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs) are susceptible to IAV. Treatment with IFN-\u03b12b or IFN-\u03bb1 rescues this phenotype. AD TLR3 deficiency may thus underlie IAV-ARDS by impairing TLR3-dependent, type I and/or III IFN-mediated, PEC-intrinsic immunity. Its clinical penetrance is incomplete for both IAV-ARDS and HSE, consistent with their typically sporadic nature.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Epithelial

Analysis of electronic health record data may allow for identification of persons at risk of host-defense impairments from within the general population. Our hypothesis was that coded infection history would inform individual risk of disease and ultimately lead to diagnosis. Methods: In this study we assessed individual risk for primary immunodeficiency by analyzing diagnostic codes and pharmacy records from members (n = 185,892) of a large pediatric health network. Relevant infection-associated diagnostic codes were weighted and enumerated for individual members allowing for risk score calculations (\"Risk Vital Sign\"). At-risk individuals underwent further assessment by chart review and re-analysis of diagnostic codes 12 months later. Results: Of the original cohort, 2188 (1.2%) individuals were identified as medium-high-risk for having a primary immunodeficiency. This group included 41 subjects who were ultimately diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency. An additional 57 medium-high risk patients had coded diagnoses worthy of referral. Conclusions: Population-wide informatics approaches can facilitate disease detection and improve outcomes. Early identification of the 98 patients with confirmed or suspected primary immunodeficiency described here could represent an annual cost savings of up to $7.7 million US Dollars.", "Keywords": ["big data and analytics", "biomedical informatics", "biomedical informatics and mathematics", "primary immumunodeficiencies", "public health"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas L", "Last Name": "Rider", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology-Allergy, Rheumatology and Retrovirology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Health Plan, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Dodds", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology-Allergy, Rheumatology and Retrovirology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vicki", "Last Name": "Modell", "Affiliation": "The Jeffrey Modell Foundation, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fred", "Last Name": "Modell", "Affiliation": "The Jeffrey Modell Foundation, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "The Jeffrey Modell Foundation, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Heidi", "Last Name": "Schwarzwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Health Plan, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30922503", "Title": "Expanding the Pipeline for Pediatric Physician-Scientists.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "Career Choice", "Curriculum", "Faculty, Medical", "Humans", "Internship and Residency", "Mentoring", "Pediatrics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Terence S", "Last Name": "Dermody", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret K", "Last Name": "Hostetter", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joseph W", "Last Name": "St Geme", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.

Scoliosis, coxa vara, childhood cataracts, short dental roots, and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported in this disorder. Although an autosomal-recessive\u00a0inheritance pattern has been hypothesized, pathogenic variants in a specific gene have not been discovered in individuals with SPONASTRIME dysplasia. Here, we identified bi-allelic variants in TONSL, which encodes the Tonsoku-like DNA repair protein, in nine subjects (from eight families) with SPONASTRIME dysplasia, and four subjects (from three families) with short stature of varied severity and spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with or without immunologic and hematologic abnormalities, but no definitive metaphyseal striations at diagnosis. The finding of early embryonic lethality in a Tonsl-/- murine model and the discovery of reduced length, spinal abnormalities, reduced numbers of neutrophils, and early lethality in a tonsl-/- zebrafish model both support the hypomorphic nature of the identified TONSL variants. Moreover, functional studies revealed increased amounts of spontaneous replication fork stalling and chromosomal aberrations, as well as fewer camptothecin (CPT)-induced RAD51 foci in subject-derived cell lines. Importantly, these cellular defects were rescued upon re-expression of wild-type (WT) TONSL; this rescue is consistent with the hypothesis that hypomorphic TONSL variants are pathogenic.

NK cells express paired receptors from the immunoglobulin family which share common ligands from the nectin family of adhesion molecules. The activating receptor CD226 (DNAM-1) binds to nectin-2 and CD155, which are also recognized by the inhibitory receptor TIGIT. The third receptor in this family is CD96, which is less well characterized and may have different functions in human and mouse models. Human CD96 interacts with CD155 and ligation of this receptor activates NK cells, while in mice the presence of CD96 correlates with decreased NK cell activation. Mouse CD96 also binds nectin-1, but the effect of this interaction has not yet been determined. Here we show that human nectin-1 directly interacts with CD96 in vitro. The binding site for CD96 is located on the nectin-1 V-domain, which comprises a canonical interface that is shared by nectins to promote cell adhesion. The affinity of nectin-1 for CD96 is lower than for other nectins such as nectin-3 and nectin-1 itself. However, the affinity of nectin-1 for CD96 is similar to its affinity for herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (HSV gD), which binds the nectin-1 V-domain during virus entry. The affinity of human CD96 for nectin-1 is lower than for its known activating ligand CD155. We also found that human erythroleukemia K562 cells, which are commonly used as susceptible targets to assess NK cell cytotoxicity did not express nectin-1 on their surface and were resistant to HSV infection. When expressed in K562 cells, nectin-1-GFP accumulated at cell contacts and allowed HSV entry. Furthermore, overexpression of nectin-1-GFP led to an increased susceptibility of K562 cells to NK-92 cell cytotoxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Binding Sites", "Cell Line", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Humans", "K562 Cells", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Mice", "Nectins", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Veronica M", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Maluquer de Motes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paige T", "Last Name": "Richards", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jessenia", "Last Name": "Roldan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Arjun K", "Last Name": "Bhargava", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Claude", "Last Name": "Krummenacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30735686", "Title": "NK cells in treated HIV-infected children display altered phenotype and function.", "Abstract": "Chronic HIV infection is known to trigger a population redistribution and alteration in the functional capacity of natural killer (NK) cells.

DNA Ligase 4-deficient patients suffer from a wide range of clinical manifestations since early in life, including: microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, growth failure, developmental delay, mental retardation; hip dysplasia, and other skeletal malformations; as well as a severe combined immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and progressive bone marrow failure; or, they may present later in life with hematological neoplasias that respond catastrophically to chemo- and radiotherapy; or, they could be asymptomatic. We describe the clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of five Mexican patients with LIG4 deficiency, together with a review of 36 other patients available in PubMed Medline. Four out of five of our patients are dead from lymphoma or bone marrow failure, with severe infection and massive bleeding; the fifth patient is asymptomatic despite a persistent CD4+ lymphopenia. Most patients reported in the literature are microcephalic females with growth failure, sinopulmonary infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, very low B-cells, and radiosensitivity; while bone marrow failure and malignancy may develop at a later age. Dysmorphic facial features, congenital hip dysplasia, chronic liver disease, gradual pancytopenia, lymphoma or leukemia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported as well. Most mutations are compound heterozygous, and all of them are hypomorphic, with two common truncating mutations accounting for the majority of patients.

The importance of their homeostasis and function can be demonstrated by the study of patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), which are part of the family of diseases known as inborn defects of immunity. While NK cells are affected in many PIDs in ways that may contribute to a patient's clinical phenotype, a small number of PIDs have an NK cell abnormality as their major immunological defect. These PIDs can be collectively referred to as NK cell deficiency (NKD) disorders and include effects upon NK cell numbers, subsets, and/or functions. The clinical impact of NKD can be severe including fatal viral infection, with particular susceptibility to herpesviral infections, such as cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. While NKD is rare, studies of these diseases are important for defining specific requirements for human NK cell development and homeostasis. New themes in NK cell biology are emerging through the study of both known and novel NKD, particularly those affecting cell cycle and DNA damage repair, as well as broader PIDs having substantive impact upon NK cells. In addition, the discovery of NKD that affects other innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets opens new doors for better understanding the relationship between conventional NK cells and other ILC subsets. Here, we describe the biology underlying human NKD, particularly in the context of new insights into innate immune cell function, including a discussion of recently described NKD with accompanying effects on ILC subsets. Given the impact of these disorders upon human immunity with a common focus upon NK cells, the unifying message of a critical role for NK cells in human host defense singularly emerges.", "Keywords": ["innate lymphoid cell", "natural killer cell", "natural killer cell deficiency", "primary immunodeficiency"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Herpesviridae Infections", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Killer Cells, Natural"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Immunological reviews", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "30425284", "Title": "Somatic alterations compromised molecular diagnosis of DOCK8 hyper-IgE syndrome caused by a novel intronic splice site mutation.", "Abstract": "In hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES), a group of primary immunodeficiencies clinically overlapping with atopic dermatitis, early diagnosis is crucial to initiate appropriate therapy and prevent irreversible complications. Identification of underlying gene defects such as in DOCK8 and STAT3 and corresponding molecular testing has improved diagnosis. Yet, in a child and her newborn sibling with HIES phenotype molecular diagnosis was misleading. Extensive analyses driven by the clinical phenotype identified an intronic homozygous DOCK8 variant c.4626\u2009+\u200976\u2009A\u2009>\u2009G creating a novel splice site as disease-causing. While the affected newborn carrying the homozygous variant had no expression of DOCK8 protein, in the index patient molecular diagnosis was compromised due to expression of altered and wildtype DOCK8 transcripts and DOCK8 protein as well as defective STAT3 signaling. Sanger sequencing of lymphocyte subsets revealed that somatic alterations and reversions revoked the predominance of the novel over the canonical splice site in the index patient explaining DOCK8 protein expression, whereas defective STAT3 responses in the index patient were explained by a T cell phenotype skewed towards central and effector memory T cells.

By contrast, we found that cancer endothelium upregulates activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), which allowed us to overcome this immune-evasion mechanism by creating an ALCAM-restricted homing system (HS). We re-engineered the natural ligand of ALCAM, CD6, in a manner that triggers initial anchorage of T cells to ALCAM and conditionally mediates a secondary wave of adhesion by sensitizing T cells to low-level ICAM1 on the cancer endothelium, thereby creating the adhesion forces necessary to capture T cells from the bloodstream.

In addition, we provide genetic and phenotypic analyses that demonstrate distinct developmental origins of NK92, YTS, and NKL cell lines. Specifically, NK92 has a phenotype associated with the CD56bright NK cell subset, while both YTS and NKL appear more CD56dim-like. Finally, by classifying cell lines based on their lytic potential, we identified genes differentially expressed between NK cell lines with high and low lytic function.

However, not all PTCs result in LoF mutations, i.e., some such transcripts escape NMD and are translated to truncated peptide products that result in disease due to gain-of-function (GoF) effects. Since the location of the PTC is a major factor determining transcript fate, we hypothesized that depletion of protein-truncating variants (PTVs) within the gene region predicted to escape NMD in control databases could provide a rank for genic susceptibility for disease through GoF versus LoF. We developed an NMD escape intolerance score to rank genes based on the depletion of PTVs that would render them able to escape NMD using the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) control databases, which was further used to screen the Baylor-Center for Mendelian Genomics disease database. This analysis revealed 1,996 genes significantly depleted for PTVs that are predicted to escape from NMD, i.e., PTVesc; further studies provided evidence that revealed a subset as candidate genes underlying Mendelian phenotypes. Importantly, these genes have characteristically low pLI scores, which can cause them to be overlooked as candidates for dominant diseases. Collectively, we demonstrate that this NMD escape intolerance score is an effective and efficient tool for gene discovery in Mendelian diseases due to production of truncated or altered proteins. More importantly, we provide a complementary analytical tool to aid identification of genes associated with dominant traits through a mechanism distinct from LoF.", "Keywords": ["NMD escape intolerance scores", "NMDEscPredictor", "WES analysis", "antimorphic", "bioinformatic tool", "dominant negative", "frameshift alleles", "genotype-phenotype correlations", "nonsense-mediated decay", "stopgain variants"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Codon, Nonsense", "Databases, Genetic", "Exome", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Humans", "Mutation", "Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zeynep", "Last Name": "Coban-Akdemir", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janson J", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaofei", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shalini N", "Last Name": "Jhangiani", "Affiliation": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jawid M", "Last Name": "Fatih", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomasz", "Last Name": "Gambin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Computer Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw 00-665, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Yavuz", "Last Name": "Bayram", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivan K", "Last Name": "Chinn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Division of Pediatric Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ender", "Last Name": "Karaca", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaya", "Last Name": "Punetha", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "Poli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Division of Pediatric Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Instituto de Ciencias e Innovaci\u00f3n en Medicina, Universidad del Desarrollo, Clinica Alemana de Santiago, Santiago RM7590943, Chile."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Boerwinkle", "Affiliation": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Human Genetics Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Division of Pediatric Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tuuli", "Last Name": "Lappalainen", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10013, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Proteasome maturation protein (POMP) is a chaperone for proteasome assembly and is critical for the incorporation of catalytic subunits into the proteasome. Here, we characterize and describe POMP-related autoinflammation and immune dysregulation disease (PRAID) discovered in two unrelated individuals with a unique constellation of early-onset combined immunodeficiency, inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis, and autoimmunity.

To understand the epigenetic alterations induced by helminth coinfections, we evaluated the longitudinal effect of ascariasis and schistosomiasis infection on CD4+ T cell DNA methylation and the downstream tuberculosis (TB)-specific and bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin-induced immune phenotype. All experiments were performed on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed children. Compared with age-matched uninfected controls, children with active Schistosoma haematobium and Ascaris lumbricoides infection had 751 differentially DNA-methylated genes, with 72% hypermethylated. Gene ontology pathway analysis identified inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling, cellular proliferation, and the Th1 pathway. Targeted real-time quantitative PCR after methyl-specific endonuclease digestion confirmed DNA hypermethylation of the transcription factors BATF3, ID2, STAT5A, IRF5, PPARg, RUNX2, IRF4, and NFATC1 and cytokines or cytokine receptors IFNGR1, TNFS11, RELT (TNF receptor), IL12RB2, and IL12B (p < 0.001; Sidak-Bonferroni). Functional blockage of the IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway was confirmed, with helminth-infected individuals having decreased upregulation of IFN-\u03b3-inducible genes (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05). Hypomethylation of the IL-4 pathway and DNA hypermethylation of the Th1 pathway was confirmed by Ag-specific multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased TB-specific IFN-\u03b3 and TNF and increased IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.05). In S. haematobium-infected individuals, these DNA methylation and immune phenotypic changes persisted at least 6 mo after successful deworming.

Many patients with PI are undiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or misdiagnosed. In fact, recent studies have shown that PI may be more common than previously estimated and that as many as 1% of the population may be affected with a PI when all types and varieties are considered. In order to raise awareness of PI with the overall goal of reducing associated morbidity and mortality, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) established a network of specialized centers that could better identify, diagnose, treat, and follow patients with PI disorders. Over the past decade, the Jeffrey Modell Centers Network (JMCN) has provided the infrastructure to accept referrals, provide diagnosis, and offer treatments. Currently, the network consists of 792 Expert Physicians at 358 institutions, in 277 cities, and 86 countries spanning 6 continents. JMF developed an annual survey for physician experts within the JMCN, using the categories and gene defects identified by the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee for the Classification of PI, to report on the number of patients identified with PI; treatment modalities, including immunoglobulins, transplantation, and gene therapy; and data on gender and age. Center Directors also provided physician-reported outcomes and differentials pre- and post-diagnosis. The current physician-reported data reflect an increase in diagnosed patients, as well as those receiving treatment. Suspected patients are being identified and referred so that they can receive early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The significant increase in patients identified with a PI is due, in part, to expanding education and awareness initiatives, newborn screening, and the expansion of molecular diagnosis and sequencing.

We sought to define the genomic spectrum and associated outcomes of a diverse cohort of children who met the HLH-2004 criteria. Genetic testing was performed clinically or through research-based whole-exome sequencing. Clinical metrics were analyzed with respect to genomic results. Of 122 subjects enrolled over the course of 17 years, 101 subjects received genetic testing. Biallelic familial HLH (fHLH) gene defects were identified in only 19 (19%) and correlated with presentation at younger than 1 year of age (P < .0001). Digenic fHLH variants were observed but lacked statistical support for disease association. In 28 (58%) of 48 subjects, research whole-exome sequencing analyses successfully identified likely molecular explanations, including underlying primary immunodeficiency diseases, dysregulated immune activation and proliferation disorders, and potentially novel genetic conditions. Two-thirds of patients identified by the HLH-2004 criteria had underlying etiologies for HLH, including genetic defects, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Overall survival was 45%, and increased mortality correlated with HLH triggered by infection or malignancy (P < .05). Differences in survival did not correlate with genetic profile or extent of therapy. HLH should be conceptualized as a phenotype of critical illness characterized by toxic activation of immune cells from different underlying mechanisms.

We evaluated the incidence and timing of adverse events and potential risk factors. We described in detailed the novel finding of increased autoimmunity after HSCT in patients with CGD. At a median follow-up of 1460 days, 22 patients were full donor chimeras, and 2 patients had stable mixed chimerism. All assessable patients showed normalization of their neutrophil oxidative burst test. None of the patients developed grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease, and no patient had chronic graft-versus-host disease. Twelve of 24 patients developed 17 autoimmune diseases (ADs). Severe ADs (cytopenia and neuropathy) occurred exclusively in the unrelated donor setting and mainly in the first year after HSCT, whereas thyroid AD occurred in the related donor setting as well and more than 3 years after HSCT. Two patients died due to infectious complications after developing autoimmune cytopenias. One additional patient suffered severe brain injury.

NK cells mediate cytotoxicity predominantly through directed secretion of lytic granules, which are specialized lysosome-related organelles, containing effector molecules such as perforin and granzymes. Although many requirements for lytic granule transport to, and secretion at, the NK cell lytic synapse are known, the minimum number of degranulation events required by an NK cell to kill its target is unknown. We performed high-resolution four-dimensional confocal microscopy of human NK-target cell conjugates to quantify NK cell degranulation (using a degranulation indicator, LAMP-1-pHluorin) as well as target cell death. Despite containing almost 200 granules, we found that an individual NK cell needed only two to four degranulation events, on average, to mediate target cell death. Although NK cells released approximately one-tenth of their total lytic granule reserve upon a single target, they required just over one-hundredth of their total lytic granules to kill a target cell. Importantly, the kinetics of NK cell killing correlated to the size of and the amount of effector molecules contained within lytic granules, as well as the temporal, but not spatial, organization of degranulation events. Thus, our study answers a fundamental question as to how many degranulation events it takes for a human NK cell to kill its target.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Degranulation", "Cell Line", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lavesh A", "Last Name": "Gwalani", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, and Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, and Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030 orange@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2018May01"}, {"PMID": "29576764", "Title": "Corrigendum: Specific Antibody Deficiency: Controversies in Diagnosis and Management.", "Abstract": "[This corrects the article on p. 586 in vol. 8, PMID: 28588580.].", "Keywords": ["antibody deficiency", "diagnosis", "immunoglobulin replacement therapy", "pneumococcal vaccines", "primary immunodeficiency", "specific antibody deficiency", "treatment"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Allergy Associates of the Palm Beaches, North Palm Beach, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Francisco A", "Last Name": "Bonilla", "Affiliation": "Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Ballow", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida, Saint Petersburg, FL, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "29553488", "Title": "The Value of Food Allergy Prevention in Clinical Practice in Pediatrics: Targeting Early Life.", "Abstract": "Food allergies are common and increasing in prevalence, representing a major health concern in many countries around the world.

Actin remodeling at the lytic immunological synapse\u00a0is a critical requirement for multiple facets of cytotoxic function. Activating receptor and integrin signaling leads to the regulated turnover and remodeling of actin, which is required for adhesion, sustained receptor signaling, and ultimately exocytosis. NK cells undergo lytic granule exocytosis in hypodense regions of a pervasive actin network. Although these requirements have been well demonstrated, neither the dynamic regulation of synaptic actin nor its specific function, however, has been determined at a nanoscale level. Here, live-cell super-resolution microscopy demonstrates nanoscale filamentous actin dynamism in NK cell lytic granule secretion. Following cell spreading, the overall content of the branched actin network at an immune synapse is stable over time and contains branched actin fibers and discrete actin foci. Similar actin architecture is generated in cytolytic T\u00a0cells, although the timescale differs from that of NK cells. Individual filament displacement leads to stochastic clearance formation and disappearance, which are independent of lytic granule positioning. Actin dynamism is dependent upon branched network formation mediated by Arp2/3 and contractility generated by myosin IIA. Importantly, the use of small-molecule inhibitors demonstrates that actin dynamism is ultimately needed for granule secretion. Thus, we describe a requirement for nanoscale actin fiber rearrangement in generating the complex actin architecture that enables lytic granule secretion.", "Keywords": ["actin cytoskeleton", "cytotoxicity", "degranulation", "immune synapse", "natural killer cell", "super-resolution microscopy"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Cell Line", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Cytoskeleton", "Exocytosis", "Humans", "Immunological Synapses", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandre F", "Last Name": "Carisey", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Manchester, 46 Grafton Street, Manchester M13 9NT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mezida B", "Last Name": "Saeed", "Affiliation": "Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Manchester, 46 Grafton Street, Manchester M13 9NT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Manchester, 46 Grafton Street, Manchester M13 9NT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

We aimed to improve this killing by substituting the CD28 costimulatory endodomain (28.z) with 4-1BB (BB.z), as 28.z CD5 CAR T cells rapidly differentiated into short-lived effector cells. In contrast, 4-1BB costimulation is known to promote development of the central memory subpopulation. Here, we found BB.z CD5 CAR T cells had impaired growth compared with 28.z CD5.CAR T cells, due to increased T-cell-T-cell fratricide. We demonstrate that TRAF signaling from the 4-1BB endodomain upregulated the intercellular adhesion molecule 1, which stabilized the fratricidal immunologic synapse between CD5 CAR T cells. As the surviving BB.z CD5 CAR T cells retained the desired central memory phenotype, we aimed to circumvent the 4-1BB-mediated toxicity using a regulated expression system that reversibly inhibits CAR expression. This system minimized CAR signaling and T-cell fratricide during in vitro expansion in the presence of a small-molecule inhibitor, and restored CAR expression and antitumor function of transduced T cells in vivo These studies reveal a mechanism by which 4-1BB costimulation impairs expansion of CD5 CAR T cells and offer a solution to mitigate this toxicity.

However, in patients with cancer, both signals are frequently impaired. Hence, we developed a novel strategy that combines both essential signals in 1 transgene by expressing the nonlymphoid hematopoietic growth factor receptor c-MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia), the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO), in T cells. c-MPL signaling activates pathways shared with conventional costimulatory and cytokine receptor signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that host-derived TPO, present in the tumor microenvironment, or pharmacological c-MPL agonists approved by the US Food and Drug Administration could deliver both signals to c-MPL-engineered TCR-transgenic T cells. We found that c-MPL+ polyclonal T cells expand and proliferate in response to TPO, and persist longer after adoptive transfer in immunodeficient human TPO-transgenic mice. In TCR-transgenic T cells, c-MPL activation enhances antitumor function, T-cell expansion, and cytokine production and preserves a central memory phenotype. c-MPL signaling also enables sequential tumor cell killing, enhances the formation of effective immune synapses, and improves antileukemic activity in vivo in a leukemia xenograft model. We identify the type 1 interferon pathway as a molecular mechanism by which c-MPL mediates immune stimulation in T cells.

Analyses for variants in genes associated with radiation sensitivity identified the presence of a homozygous RNF168 variant of unknown significance. RNF168 deficiency causes radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties syndrome and may account for the radiation sensitivity. Thus, the patient was found to have a novel blended phenotype associated with multilocus genomic variation: i.e., separate and distinct genetic defects. These findings further illustrate the clinical utility of applying genomic testing in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases.", "Keywords": ["RNF168", "ZAP70", "and learning difficulties syndrome", "blended phenotype", "dysmorphic features", "immunodeficiency", "primary immunodeficiency", "radiosensitivity", "whole-exome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ivan K", "Last Name": "Chinn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Sanders", "Affiliation": "Texas Transplant Institute, Methodist Hospital, San Antonio, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Asbj\u00f8rg", "Last Name": "Stray-Pedersen", "Affiliation": "Norwegian National Unit for Newborn Screening, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Zeynep H", "Last Name": "Coban-Akdemir", "Affiliation": "Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vy Hong-Diep", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology and Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Harjit", "Last Name": "Dadi", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology and Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Chaim M", "Last Name": "Roifman", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology and Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Troy", "Last Name": "Quigg", "Affiliation": "Texas Transplant Institute, Methodist Hospital, San Antonio, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "I Celine", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28588580", "Title": "Specific Antibody Deficiency: Controversies in Diagnosis and Management.", "Abstract": "Specific antibody deficiency (SAD) is a primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by normal immunoglobulins (Igs), IgA, IgM, total IgG, and IgG subclass levels, but with recurrent infection and diminished antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens following vaccination. There is a lack of consensus regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SAD, and its clinical significance is not well understood. Here, we discuss current evidence and challenges regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SAD. SAD is normally diagnosed by determining protective titers in response to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. However, the definition of an adequate response to immunization remains controversial, including the magnitude of response and number of pneumococcal serotypes needed to determine a normal response. Confounding these issues, anti-polysaccharide antibody responses are age- and probably serotype dependent. Therapeutic strategies and options for patients with SAD are often based on clinical experience due to the lack of focused studies and absence of a robust case definition. The mainstay of therapy for patients with SAD is antibiotic prophylaxis. However, there is no consensus regarding the frequency and severity of infections warranting antibiotic prophylaxis and no standardized regimens and no studies of efficacy. Published expert guidelines and opinions have recommended IgG therapy, which are supported by observations from retrospective studies, although definitive data are lacking. In summary, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the efficacy of therapeutic strategies for patients with SAD.

We also show that IQGAP1 appears to both stabilize the actin coating and constrain its growth. Loss of compartmental IQGAP1 initiates a disassembly mechanism involving rapid and unconstrained actin polymerization around the compartment and dispersal of its vesicle contents. Together, these findings suggest IQGAP1 achieves this control by harnessing both stabilizing and antagonistic interactions with actin.

Dysregulation of Optn has been linked to neurodegenerative, autoimmune and bone diseases. Optn shares a high degree of homology with NEMO, but is not part of the same high-molecular weight complex containing IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2. Despite its homology with NEMO and the fact that it has been the subject of extensive study in several cell types, there are no published studies addressing the role of Optn during T cell activation. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Optn down-regulates TCR-induced NF-\u03baB activation and TNF-\u03b1 production, in a manner dependent on ubiquitin-binding. Conversely, knock-down of Optn enhances NF-\u03baB activation and the production of TNF-\u03b1. Consistent with a negative regulatory role for this protein, we observed transient loss of Optn after TCR stimulation in both cell lines and in primary murine T cells. The acute loss of Optn appears to be due to both protein degradation and exocytosis, the latter via activation-induced exosomes. This study therefore provides novel information regarding the role of Optn during TCR activation, suggesting the possible importance of Optn during inflammation and/or autoimmune diseases.", "Keywords": ["Extracellular vesicles", "NF-kappa B (NF-\u03baB)", "Optineurin", "T cells", "T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line", "Eye Proteins", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "NF-kappa B", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transcription Factor TFIIIA", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Montecalvo", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States."}, {"First Name": "Simon C", "Last Name": "Watkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jordan", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence P", "Last Name": "Kane", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States.

The consequences of RASGRP1 mutations in humans are unknown. In a patient with recurrent bacterial and viral infections, born to healthy consanguineous parents, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify a biallelic stop-gain variant in RASGRP1. This variant segregated perfectly with the disease and has not been reported in genetic databases. RASGRP1 deficiency was associated in T cells and B cells with decreased phosphorylation of the extracellular-signal-regulated serine kinase ERK, which was restored following expression of wild-type RASGRP1. RASGRP1 deficiency also resulted in defective proliferation, activation and motility of T cells and B cells. RASGRP1-deficient natural killer (NK) cells exhibited impaired cytotoxicity with defective granule convergence and actin accumulation.

In 3 families, we identified 4 children with recurrent infections and varying clinical manifestations including mild neutropenia, impaired wound healing, severe stomatitis with oral stenosis, and death. All patients studied had similar distinctive neutrophil herniation of the nuclear lobes and agranular regions within the cytosol. Chemotaxis and chemokinesis were markedly impaired, but staphylococcal killing was normal, and neutrophil oxidative burst was increased both basally and on stimulation. Neutrophil spreading on glass and cell polarization were also impaired. Neutrophil F-actin was elevated fourfold, suggesting an abnormality in F-actin regulation. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis identified abnormal actin-interacting protein 1 (Aip1), encoded by WDR1, in patient samples. Biallelic mutations in WDR1 affecting distinct antiparallel \u03b2-strands of Aip1 were identified in all patients. It has been previously reported that Aip1 regulates cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization, which is required for normal neutrophil function. Heterozygous mutations in clinically normal relatives confirmed that WDR1 deficiency is autosomal recessive. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation corrected the immunologic defect in 1 patient. Mutations in WDR1 affect neutrophil morphology, motility, and function, causing a novel primary immunodeficiency.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Child", "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Leukocyte Disorders", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Microfilament Proteins", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Mutation", "Neutrophils", "Pedigree"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Douglas B", "Last Name": "Kuhns", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Danielle L", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Uimook", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Host Defenses and."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Sweeney", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Host Defenses and."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Lau", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Debra Long", "Last Name": "Priel", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Dara", "Last Name": "Riva", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Mendez", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Gulbu", "Last Name": "Uzel", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra F", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth N", "Last Name": "Olivier", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Victoria L", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Currens", "Affiliation": "Werner H.

Moreover, WASp KO mice controlled growth of A20 lymphoma cells that naturally produced IL-2. WASp KO NK cells showed increased expression of DNAM-1, LAG-3, and KLRG1, all receptors associated with cellular exhaustion and NK cell memory.

Impairments in chromosome maintenance are linked to rare chromosome breakage disorders. Here, we have identified a chromosome breakage syndrome associated with severe lung disease in early childhood. Four children from two unrelated kindreds died of severe pulmonary disease during infancy following viral pneumonia with evidence of combined T and B cell immunodeficiency. Whole exome sequencing revealed biallelic missense mutations in the NSMCE3 (also known as NDNL2) gene, which encodes a subunit of the SMC5/6 complex that is essential for DNA damage response and chromosome segregation. The NSMCE3 mutations disrupted interactions within the SMC5/6 complex, leading to destabilization of the complex.

Given the heterogeneous expression of antigens on glioblastomas, we hypothesized that a bispecific CAR molecule would mitigate antigen escape and improve the antitumor activity of T cells. Here, we created a CAR that joins a HER2-binding scFv and an IL13R\u03b12-binding IL-13 mutein to make a tandem CAR exodomain (TanCAR) and a CD28.\u03b6 endodomain. We determined that patient TanCAR T cells showed distinct binding to HER2 or IL13R\u03b12 and had the capability to lyse autologous glioblastoma. TanCAR T cells exhibited activation dynamics that were comparable to those of single CAR T cells upon encounter of HER2 or IL13R\u03b12. We observed that TanCARs engaged HER2 and IL13R\u03b12 simultaneously by inducing HER2-IL13R\u03b12 heterodimers, which promoted superadditive T cell activation when both antigens were encountered concurrently. TanCAR T cell activity was more sustained but not more exhaustible than that of T cells that coexpressed a HER2 CAR and an IL13R\u03b12 CAR, T cells with a unispecific CAR, or a pooled product. In a murine glioblastoma model, TanCAR T cells mitigated antigen escape, displayed enhanced antitumor efficacy, and improved animal survival. Thus, TanCAR T cells show therapeutic potential to improve glioblastoma control by coengaging HER2 and IL13R\u03b12 in an augmented, bivalent immune synapse that enhances T cell functionality and reduces antigen escape.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Interleukin-13", "Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha2 Subunit", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transgenes", "Tumor Escape"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Hegde", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Malini", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zakaria", "Last Name": "Grada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Antonella", "Last Name": "Pignata", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Landi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shoba A", "Last Name": "Navai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Wakefield", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Fousek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Bielamowicz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin K H", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vita S", "Last Name": "Brawley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiara T", "Last Name": "Byrd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Krebs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Gottschalk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Winfried S", "Last Name": "Wels", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew L", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gianpietro", "Last Name": "Dotti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maksim", "Last Name": "Mamonkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Malcolm K", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nabil", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2016Aug01"}, {"PMID": "27389351", "Title": "Schistosome Soluble Egg Antigen Decreases Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Effector Function With Concomitant Arrest of Macrophage Phago-Lysosome Maturation.", "Abstract": "Helminth-infected individuals possess a higher risk of developing tuberculosis, but the precise immunologic mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis control remains unclear.

As a category of primary immunodeficiency diseases, those that impair immune regulation can lead to autoimmunity and/or autoinflammation. In this review we focus on one of the most recently discovered primary immunodeficiencies that leads to immune dysregulation: \"Copa syndrome\". Copa syndrome is named for the gene mutated in the disease, which encodes the alpha subunit of the coatomer complex-I that, in aggregate, is devoted to transiting molecular cargo from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Copa syndrome is autosomal dominant with variable expressivity and results from mutations affecting a narrow amino acid stretch in the COPA gene-encoding COP\u03b1 protein. Patients with these mutations typically develop arthritis and interstitial lung disease with pulmonary hemorrhage representing a striking feature. Immunologically Copa syndrome is associated with autoantibody development, increased Th17 cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Insights have also been gained into the underlying mechanism of Copa syndrome, which include excessive ER stress owing to the impaired return of proteins from the Golgi, and presumably resulting aberrant cellular autophagy. As such it represents a novel cellular disorder of intracellular trafficking associated with a specific clinical presentation and phenotype.", "Keywords": ["Autoimmunity", "arthritis", "autosomal

Hypomorphic NEMO mutations result in X-linked ectodermal dysplasia with anhidrosis and immunodeficiency, also referred to as NEMO syndrome. Here we describe a distinct group of patients with NEMO C-terminal deletion (\u0394CT-NEMO) mutations. Individuals harboring these mutations develop inflammatory skin and intestinal disease in addition to ectodermal dysplasia with anhidrosis and immunodeficiency. Both primary cells from these patients, as well as reconstituted cell lines with this deletion, exhibited increased I\u03baB kinase (IKK) activity and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Unlike previously described loss-of-function mutations, \u0394CT-NEMO mutants promoted increased NF-\u03baB activation in response to TNF and Toll-like receptor stimulation. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed impaired interactions with A20, a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB activation, leading to prolonged accumulation of K63-ubiquitinated RIP within the TNFR1 signaling complex. Recruitment of A20 to the C-terminal domain of NEMO represents a novel mechanism limiting NF-\u03baB activation by NEMO, and its absence results in autoinflammatory disease.", "Keywords": ["A20", "HED-ID", "NF-\u03baB", "TLR", "autoinflammatory disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Case-Control Studies", "Cell Line", "Cell Nucleus", "Cytokines", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "I-kappa B Kinase", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Monocytes", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "NF-kappa B", "Nuclear Proteins", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Polyubiquitin", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Protein Transport", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor", "T-Lymphocytes", "Toll-Like Receptors", "Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Ubiquitination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jevgenia", "Last Name": "Zilberman-Rudenko", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Linda Monaco", "Last Name": "Shawver", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104;"}, {"First Name": "Alex W", "Last Name": "Wessel", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Yongquan", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Pelletier", "Affiliation": "Immunoregulation Section, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Wanxia Li", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Translational Immunology Section, Office of Science and Technology, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Younglang", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Spiridon", "Last Name": "Vonortas", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Laurence", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA 94143;"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Ashwell", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030."}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "Immunoregulation Section, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;"}, {"First Name": "Eric P", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "Immunodeficiency and Inflammation Unit, Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; eric.hanson@nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Feb09"}, {"PMID": "26802037", "Title": "Primary immunodeficiencies worldwide: an updated overview from the Jeffrey Modell Centers Global Network.", "Abstract": "Primary immunodeficiencies (PI) are defects of the immune system that cause severe, sometimes life-threatening, infections if not diagnosed and treated appropriately.

Data are requested annually from physician experts within the Jeffrey Modell Centers Network\u00a0(JMCN), consisting of 602 expert physicians, at 253 academic institutions, in 206 cities, and 84 countries spanning six continents. Center Directors reported on patients' specific PI defects and treatment modalities including immunoglobulins, transplantation, and gene therapy as well as data on gender and age. Center Directors also provided physician-reported patient outcomes as well as pre- and post-diagnosis differences. Costs were assigned to these factors. In collaboration with the Network, JMF advocated, funded, and implemented population-based newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency and T cell lymphopenia, covering 96.2\u00a0% of all newborns in the US.

SNP-h(2) estimates are most significant for T1D (0.863\u00b1s.e. 0.07) and JIA (0.727\u00b1s.e. 0.037), more modest for UC (0.386\u00b1s.e. 0.04) and CD (0.454\u00b10.025), largely consistent with population estimates and are generally greater than that previously reported by adult GWAS. On pairwise analysis, we observed that the diseases UC-CD (0.69\u00b1s.e. 0.07) and JIA-CVID (0.343\u00b1s.e. 0.13) are the most strongly correlated. Variations across the MHC strongly contribute to SNP-h(2) in T1D and JIA, but does not significantly contribute to the pairwise rG.

We identified 27 genome-wide significant loci associated with one or more pAIDs, mapping to in silico-replicated autoimmune-associated genes (including IL2RA) and new candidate loci with established immunoregulatory functions such as ADGRL2, TENM3, ANKRD30A, ADCY7 and CD40LG. The pAID-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally enriched for deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-hypersensitivity sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites and coding variants. We also identified biologically correlated, pAID-associated candidate gene sets on the basis of immune cell expression profiling and found evidence of genetic sharing. Network and protein-interaction analyses demonstrated converging roles for the signaling pathways of type 1, 2 and 17 helper T cells (TH1, TH2 and TH17), JAK-STAT, interferon and interleukin in

Hypothesizing that mutant COPA leads to defective intracellular transport via coat protein complex I (COPI), we show that COPA variants impair binding to proteins targeted for retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport. Additionally, expression of mutant COPA results in ER stress and the upregulation of cytokines priming for a T helper type 17 (TH17) response. Patient-derived CD4(+) T cells also demonstrate significant skewing toward a TH17 phenotype that is implicated in autoimmunity.

We report a male infant who presented within the first year of life with physical growth impairment, feeding difficulties, hyperemesis without diarrhea, and abnormal hair findings suggestive of trichorrhexis nodosa. With advancing age, moderate global developmental delay, susceptibility to frequent viral illnesses, otitis media, and purulent conjunctivitis were identified. Because of the repeated infections, an immunological evaluation was pursued and identified impaired antibody memory responses following pneumococcal vaccine administration.

In an international retrospective survey of patients with DOCK8 mutations, focused on clinical presentation and therapeutic measures, a total of 136 patients with a median follow-up of 11.3 years (1.3-47.7) spanning 1693 patient years, were enrolled.

Overall survival probability in this cohort [censored for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)] was 87 % at 10, 47 % at 20, and 33 % at 30 years of age, respectively. Event free survival was 44, 18 and 4 % at the same time points if events were defined as death, life-threatening infections, malignancy or cerebral complications such as CNS vasculitis or stroke. Malignancy was diagnosed in 23/136 (17 %) patients (11 hematological and 9 epithelial cancers, 5 other malignancies) at a median age of 12 years. Eight of these patients died from cancer. Severe, life-threatening infections were observed in 79/136 (58 %); severe non-infectious cerebral events occurred in 14/136 (10 %). Therapeutic measures included antiviral and antibacterial prophylaxis, immunoglobulin replacement and HSCT.

"PTEN is a negative regulator of NK cell cytolytic function.", "Abstract": "Human NK cells are characterized by their ability to initiate an immediate and direct cytolytic response to virally infected or malignantly transformed cells. Within human peripheral blood, the more mature CD56(dim) NK cell efficiently kills malignant targets at rest, whereas the less mature CD56(bright) NK cells cannot. In this study, we show that resting CD56(bright) NK cells express significantly more phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein when compared with CD56(dim) NK cells. Consistent with this, forced overexpression of PTEN in NK cells resulted in decreased cytolytic activity, and loss of PTEN in CD56(bright) NK cells resulted in elevated cytolytic activity. Comparable studies in mice showed PTEN overexpression did not alter NK cell development or NK cell-activating and inhibitory receptor expression yet, as in humans, did decrease expression of downstream NK activation targets MAPK and AKT during early cytolysis of tumor target cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that PTEN overexpression disrupts the NK cell's ability to organize immunological synapse components including decreases in actin accumulation, polarization of the microtubule organizing center, and the convergence of cytolytic granules. In summary, our data suggest that PTEN normally works to limit the NK cell's PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activation and the consequent mobilization of cytolytic mediators toward the target cell and suggest that PTEN is among the active regulatory components prior to human NK cells transitioning from the noncytolytic CD56(bright) NK cell to the cytolytic CD56(dim) NK cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Confocal", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward L", "Last Name": "Briercheck", "Affiliation": "Medical Scientist Training Program and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;"}, {"First Name": "Rossana", "Last Name": "Trotta", "Affiliation": "The Comprehensive Cancer Center and Arthur G.

Patients with mutated NIK exhibit B-cell lymphopenia, decreased frequencies of class-switched memory B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia due to impaired B-cell survival, and impaired ICOSL expression. Although overall T-cell numbers are normal, both follicular helper and memory T cells are perturbed. Natural killer (NK) cells are decreased and exhibit defective activation, leading to impaired formation of NK-cell immunological synapses.

The appropriate management of these organelles enables the mounting of a precise and valuable host defense. The process of NK cell adhesion to a target cell through engagement of the integrin LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) promotes lytic granule organization through complex cellular mechanics and a signaling pathway characterized by Zhang et al. in this issue of Science Signaling. A set of signaling molecules was defined for their ability to promote the polarization of NK cell lytic granules and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) toward the interface with a target cell.

These IL-21-expanded NK cells also have increased NKG2D expression, which led us to focus our investigation on whether STAT3 regulates NKG2D. In this study, we show that modulation of STAT3 phosphorylation with cytokines and small-molecule inhibitors correlates with NKG2D expression on human NK cells, leading to altered NK-cell degranulation. Moreover, NKG2D expression on murine NK cells having conditional STAT3 ablation is lower than on NK cells from wild-type mice, and human NK cells carrying dominant-negative STAT3 mutations have decreased baseline NKG2D expression and blunted responses to IL-10 and IL-21. Lastly, we show binding of STAT3 to a predicted STAT3 binding site upstream of the NKG2D gene, which is enhanced by IL-10 and IL-21 and decreased by STAT3 inhibition.

Although iNKT cells thereby act as potent cellular adjuvants, it is less clear whether they directly control the growth of tumors. To gain insights into the direct contribution of iNKT cells to tumor immune surveillance, we developed in vitro and in vivo systems to selectively examine the antitumor activity of iNKT cells in the absence of other cytolytic effectors. Using the EL4 T-lymphoma cell line as a model, we found that iNKT cells exert robust and specific lysis of tumor cells in vitro in a manner that is differentially induced by iNKT cell agonists of varying T-cell receptor (TCR) affinities, such as OCH, \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide, and PBS44. In vitro blockade of CD1d-mediated lipid antigen presentation, disruption of TCR signaling, or loss of perforin expression significantly reduce iNKT cell killing. Consistent with these findings, iNKT cell reconstitution of T, B, and NK cell\u2013deficient mice slows EL4 growth in vivo via TCR-CD1d and perforin-dependent mechanisms. Together, these observations establish that iNKT cells are sufficient to control the growth of T lymphoma in vitro and in vivo.

The classical pathway requires inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) and NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), and hypomorphic mutations in the gene encoding NEMO (ikbkg) lead to inherited immunodeficiencies, collectively termed NEMO-ID.

We found that noncanonical NF-\u03baB was basally active in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from NEMO-ID patients and that noncanonical NF-\u03baB signaling was similarly enhanced in cell lines lacking functional NEMO. NIK, which normally undergoes constitutive degradation, was aberrantly present in resting NEMO-deficient cells, and regulation of its abundance was rescued by reconstitution with full-length NEMO, but not a mutant NEMO protein unable to physically associate with IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2. Binding of NEMO to IKK\u03b1 was not required for ligand-dependent stabilization of NIK or noncanonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Rather, an intact and functional IKK complex was essential to suppress basal NIK activity in unstimulated cells.

Ligand stimulation with either cortisone or dexamethsone (DEX) acutely elicited GR translocation to the nucleus and, comparably, ligand-independent stimulation either with the Th2 cytokine, IL-13, or the pleiotropic cytokine combination, IL-1\u03b2/TNF\u03b1, also acutely evoked GR translocation. The latter response was potentiated by combined exposure of cells to GR ligand and cytokine. Similarly, treatment with either DEX or IL-13 alone induced GR phosphorylation at its serine-211 residue (GR(Ser211)), denoting its activated state, and combined treatment with DEX+IL-13 elicited heightened and sustained GR(Ser211) phosphorylation. Interestingly, the above ligand-independent GR responses to IL-13 alone were not associated with downstream GR binding to its consensus DNA sequence or GR transactivation, whereas both DEX-induced GR:DNA binding and transcriptional activity were significantly heightened in the presence of IL-13, coupled to increased recruitment of the transcriptional co-factor, MED14. The stimulated GR signaling responses to DEX were prevented in IL-13-exposed cells wherein GR(Ser211) phosphorylation was suppressed either by transfection with specific serine phosphorylation-deficient mutant GRs or treatment with inhibitors of the MAPKs, ERK1/2 and JNK.

We find that T-bet and Eomes are broadly expressed in human memory CD8 T cells, with increasing levels of T-bet and Eomes strongly correlating with differentiation from central memory to effector memory and effector subpopulations. In resting T cells, T-bet levels directly correlate to subcellular localization, with a higher propensity for nuclear expression of T-bet within T-bet(hi) cells and predominantly cytoplasmic expression in T-bet(lo) cells. In addition, Eomes is also localized to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Upon TCR stimulation, the percentage of T cells that express T-bet dramatically increases, whereas the percentage of cells expressing Eomes remains largely unchanged across all memory populations. Of interest, T-bet, but not Eomes, relocalizes to the nucleus in the majority of cells across all populations within 24 h post stimulation.

Here, we investigated the proximal signaling pathways downstream of the immunotyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) bearing activating receptors. We found that the adaptor molecule SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) is recruited to microclusters at the plasma membrane in activated NK cells and that this is required for initiation of downstream signaling and multiple NK-cell effector functions in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that 2 types of proximal signaling complexes involving SLP-76 were formed. In addition to the canonical membrane complex formed between SLP-76 and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) family members, a novel LAT family-independent SLP-76-dependent signaling pathway was identified. The LAT family-independent pathway involved the SH2 domain of SLP-76 and adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP). Both the LAT family-dependent and ADAP-dependent pathway contributed to interferon-gamma production and cytotoxicity; however, they were not essential for other SLP-76-dependent events, including phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-related kinase and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate that NK cells possess an unexpected bifurcation of proximal ITAM-mediated signaling, each involving SLP-76 and contributing to optimal NK-cell function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Amino Acid Transport System y+", "Amino Acid Transport System y+L", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains", "Interferon-gamma", "Killer Cells, Natural", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, Knockout", "NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A", "Neoplasms", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "Division of Transfusion Medicine and Therapeutic Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Okumura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chin-Jung", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hamid", "Last Name": "Bassiri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Enjun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Rak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Naomi H", "Last Name": "Philip", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Baumgart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kim E", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taku", "Last Name": "Kambayashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Apr18"}, {"PMID": "23380740", "Title": "Rapid activation receptor- or IL-2-induced lytic granule convergence in human natural killer cells requires Src, but not downstream signaling.", "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells participate in host defense by surveying for and ultimately killing virally infected or malignant target cells. NK cell cytotoxicity is a tightly regulated process that proceeds stepwise from adhesion and activation to the secretion of preformed lytic granule contents onto a diseased or stressed cell. We previously characterized rapid dynein-dependent lytic granule convergence to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) as an early, prerequisite step in NK cell cytotoxicity. Although multiple activating receptors can trigger granule convergence, the specific signal or signals responsible remained unknown. Using live cell confocal microscopy, NK cell lytic granule movement after NK cell activation was captured and measured. Using inhibitors of common early signaling mediators, we show that Src kinases are required for lytic granule convergence, but downstream signals that promote actin rearrangement, MTOC polarization, and calcium mobilization are not. Exposure to interleukin 2 was also sufficient to induce lytic granule convergence, which required noncanonical Src-dependent signaling. Thus, NK cell lytic granule convergence, prompted by specific receptor-mediated and soluble cytokine signals, depends on a directly downstream early Src kinase-dependent signal and emphasizes the importance of this step in readying NK cells for cytotoxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "CD18 Antigens", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Dyneins", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Interleukin-2", "Janus Kinase 3", "K562 Cells", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphocyte Activation", "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microtubule-Organizing Center", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction", "src-Family Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashley Mentlik", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hsiang-Ting", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Prachi", "Last Name": "Dongre", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gulbu", "Last Name": "Uzel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pinaki P", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Apr04"}, {"PMID": "23380217", "Title": "Defective actin accumulation impairs human natural killer cell function in patients with dedicator of cytokinesis 8 deficiency.", "Abstract": "Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) mutations are responsible for a rare primary combined immunodeficiency syndrome associated with severe cutaneous viral infections, increased IgE levels, autoimmunity, and malignancy.
