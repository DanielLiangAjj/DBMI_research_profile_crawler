[{"PMID": "38854169", "Title": "A Prolonged Case of Severe Mpox as an Opportunistic Infection in Advanced AIDS.", "Abstract": "The case report discusses a 29-year-old male with advanced HIV who experienced one of the longest, confirmed cases of monkeypox (mpox) infection. Despite treatment with antivirals and supportive care, including intravenous tecovirimat and vaccinia immune globulin, the patient's condition worsened over a six-and-a-half-month period. He suffered from widespread ulcerative, necrotic lesions and multiple complications, including acute kidney injury, multi-drug resistant bacterial infections, and respiratory failure. Despite repeated treatments, including brincidofovir, the patient remained PCR-positive for monkeypox virus (MPXV) with low cycle threshold (Ct) values, indicating active infection. The case underscores the severity of mpox in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV, and highlights the challenges in managing such cases. The patient's persistently low CD4 count and unsuppressed HIV viral load likely contributed to the inability to clear the virus. The report emphasizes the need for further research to optimize treatment strategies for MPXV infection, especially in people living with HIV.", "Keywords": ["aids", "hiv", "monkeypox", "opportunistic infections", "prolonged illness"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matan S", "Last Name": "Malka", "Affiliation": "Medicine, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Parkinson", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Zucker", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob R", "Last Name": "McLean", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus R", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shauna H", "Last Name": "Gunaratne", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease, Columbia University, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Cureus", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38826270", "Title": "Men with HIV Have Increased Alveolar Bone Loss.", "Abstract": "Periodontal health in men with HIV remains understudied, despite suggestions of associations between HIV infection and gingival pocketing, periodontal attachment loss, and gingival inflammation.

Surveillance, a cornerstone of disease control and prevention, can be strengthened to promote more timely, efficient, and equitable practices by incorporating health information exchange (HIE) and other large-scale health data sources into reporting. New York City patient-level electronic health record data between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were obtained from Healthix, the largest US public HIE. Healthix data were linked to neighborhood-level information from the American Community Survey. In this casecontrol study, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV-positive cases were compared to controls to estimate the odds of receiving a specific laboratory test or positive result using generalized estimating equations with logit function and robust standard errors. Among 1,519,121 tests performed for chlamydia, 1,574,772 for gonorrhea, and 1,200,560 for HIV, 2%, 0.6% and 0.3% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV, respectively. Chlamydia and gonorrhea co-occurred in 1,854 cases (7% of chlamydia and 21% of gonorrhea total cases). Testing behavior was often incongruent with geographic and sociodemographic patterns of positive cases. For example, people living in areas with the highest levels of poverty were less likely to test for gonorrhea but almost twice as likely to test positive compared to those in low poverty areas. Regional HIE enabled review of testing and cases using granular and complementary data not typically available given existing reporting practices. Enhanced surveillance spotlights potential incongruencies between testing patterns and STI risk in certain populations, signaling potential under- and over-testing. These and future insights derived from HIE data may be used to continuously inform public health practice and drive further improvements in provision and evaluation of services and programs.", "Keywords": ["disease surveillance", "health equity", "health information exchange", "infectious diseases", "public health informatics", "sexually transmitted infections"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Harry", "Last Name": "Reyes Nieva", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zucker", "Last Name": "Jason", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Tucker", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, new York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "No\u00e9mie", "Last Name": "Elhadad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Apr12"}, {"PMID": "38366369", "Title": "Epigenetic Aging and Musculoskeletal Outcomes in a Cohort of Women Living With HIV.", "Abstract": "The relationship between accelerated epigenetic aging and musculoskeletal outcomes in women with HIV (WWH) has not been studied.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "bone mineral density", "epigenetic aging", "osteoporosis", "physical function"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Middle Aged", "HIV Infections", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "DNA Methylation", "Aging", "Bone Density", "Adult", "Cohort Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Shiau", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Rutgers School of Public Health, Piscataway, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Zumpano", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Rutgers School of Public Health, Piscataway, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Ziyi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Rutgers School of Public Health, Piscataway, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Jayesh", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis C", "Last Name": "Tien", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ryan D", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "PubDate": "2024Jun14"}, {"PMID": "38341183", "Title": "Menopause-Associated Changes in Mandibular Bone Microarchitecture Are Site-Specific.", "Abstract": "There are conflicting reports on the effects of decreased estrogen levels on mandibular bone microarchitecture.

However, the relative risks associated with specific antibiotics may vary over time, and the absolute risks have not been clearly established. This is a retrospective cohort study. Adults were included if they received an outpatient antibiotic prescription within the IBM MarketScan databases between 2008 and 2020. The primary exposure was an outpatient antibiotic prescription, and the receipt of doxycycline was used as the reference comparison. The primary outcome was CA-CDI, defined as the presence of an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code for CDI within 90\u2009days of receiving an outpatient antibiotic prescription, and subsequent treatment for CDI. There were 36,626,794 unique patients who received outpatient antibiotics, including 11,607 (0.03%) who developed CA-CDI. Relative to doxycycline, the antibiotics conferring the highest risks for CA-CDI were clindamycin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.76 to 10.00), cefdinir (aOR, 5.86; 95% CI, 5.03 to 6.83), cefuroxime (aOR, 4.57; 95% CI, 3.87 to 5.39), and fluoroquinolones (aOR, 4.05; 95% CI, 3.58 to 4.59). Among older patients with CA-CDI risk factors, nitrofurantoin was also associated with CA-CDI (aOR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.92 to 4.84), with a smaller number needed to harm, compared to the fluoroquinolones. While clindamycin, cefuroxime, and fluoroquinolone use declined from 2008 to 2020, nitrofurantoin use increased by 40%. Clindamycin was associated with the greatest CA-CDI risk, overall. Among older patients with an elevated baseline risk for CA-CDI, multiple antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, had strong associations with CA-CDI.

While DXA is the gold-standard for bone assessments, it lacks availability in resource-constrained settings (RCS). Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) offers an alternative owing to its portability, low cost, ease of handling, and lack of ionizing radiation. While QUS has detected reduced bone quality in CLHIV, the relationship between QUS and DXA in this population remains unexplored. At baseline and 12 months, BMC and BMD of the whole body, lumbar spine, and radius were measured by DXA in a longitudinal cohort of CLHIV in Johannesburg, South Africa. Calcaneal speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and radius SOS were obtained by QUS, and calcaneal stiffness index (SI) was calculated. Spearman correlations, with and without HIV stratification, were performed between QUS and DXA measurements at each visit and for absolute difference in measurements between visits. At baseline and 12-months, calcaneal BUA and SI displayed strong positive correlations with DXA, with only modest correlations between radial QUS and DXA at baseline. Longitudinal measures of QUS did not correlate with DXA. At both baseline and 12-months, individuals with DXA whole-body BMD z-score < -1 displayed significantly lower calcaneal BUA and SI. Cross-sectionally, calcaneal QUS correlates strongly with whole body DXA and may represent a viable diagnostic alternative in RCS.

(SARS-CoV-2) have emerged continuously, challenging the effectiveness of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments. Moreover, the possibility of the appearance of a new betacoronavirus with high transmissibility and high fatality is reason for concern. In this study, we used a natively paired yeast display technology, combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and massive bioinformatic analysis to perform a comprehensive study of subdomain specificity of natural human antibodies from two convalescent donors. Using this screening technology, we mapped the cross-reactive responses of antibodies generated by the two donors against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other betacoronaviruses. We tested the neutralization potency of a set of the cross-reactive antibodies generated in this study and observed that most of the antibodies produced by these patients were non-neutralizing. We performed a comparison of the specific and non-specific antibodies by somatic hypermutation in a repertoire-scale for the two individuals and observed that the degree of somatic hypermutation was unique for each patient.

Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses, suggesting that 10-40 is a promising agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses but also uncovered a distinct antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif.

We2 and others3-6 recently reported results confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of the evolution of Omicron has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K alteration (BA.1+R346K, also known as BA.1.1) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike alterations and lacking 13 spike alterations found in BA.1. Here we extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.1 (refs. 2,3,5,6). These findings indicate that these three sublineages of Omicron are antigenically equidistant from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and thus similarly threaten the efficacies of current vaccines.

It is expected to become dominant in the coming weeks2, probably due to enhanced transmissibility. A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings of our study. Here we found that B.1.1.529 is markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals who were vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from individuals who were vaccinated and received a booster dose of mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies against all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 out of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones that are currently authorized or approved for use in patients. Moreover, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance on B.1.1.529.

Population PK (POPPK) models based on suitably powered clinical studies with appropriate sampling strategies that take variability into consideration can inform PMB dosing to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity and resistance. Here we reviewed published PMB POPPK models and evaluated them using an external validation data set (EVD) of patients who are critically ill and enrolled in an ongoing clinical study to assess their utility. Seven published POPPK models were employed using the reported model equations, parameter values, covariate relationships, interpatient variability, parameter covariance, and unexplained residual variability in NONMEM (Version 7.4.3). The predictive ability of the models was assessed using prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics. Patient characteristics and treatment information were comparable across studies and with the EVD (n = 40), but the sampling strategy was a main source of PK variability across studies. All models visually and statistically underpredicted EVD plasma concentrations, but the two-compartment models more accurately described the external data set. As current POPPK models were inadequately predictive of the EVD, creation of a new POPPK model based on an appropriately powered clinical study with an informed PK sampling strategy would be expected to improve characterization of PMB PK and identify covariates to explain interpatient variability.

While studies have shown clinically significant rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after COVID-19, little is known about how these symptoms evolve over time. Here, we report findings from a cohort study of 52 participants recruited from the greater New York City area following acute COVID-19 infection. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety-related symptoms, the Insomnia Severity Scale (ISS) for sleep-related symptoms, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) for trauma-related symptoms both at baseline and at long-term (24-60 weeks post-infection) follow-up. We found a high degree of correlation between psychiatric symptom scales within participants. More participants met established cutoffs for clinically significant insomnia and post-traumatic stress at follow-up compared to baseline. Symptom scales for depression, insomnia, and PTSD were increased at long-term follow-up, with only increased PCL-C scores surviving correction for multiple comparisons (Z\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b2.92, W\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b434, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.004).

Using a cohort of 66 COVID-19-positive women in late pregnancy, we correlated clinical parameters with disease severity, placental histopathology, and the expression of viral entry and Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) antiviral transcripts. All newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the demographic parameters or placental histopathological characteristics were associated with disease severity. The fetal-maternal transfer ratio for IgG against the N or S viral proteins was commonly less than one, as recently reported. We found that the expression level of placental ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, was higher in women with severe COVID-19. Placental expression of IFITM1 and IFITM3, which have been implicated in antiviral response, was higher in participants with severe disease. We also showed that IFITM3 protein expression, which localized to early and late endosomes, was enhanced in severe COVID-19.

Effective interventions need to be developed to end this pandemic. Single and combination therapies with monoclonal antibodies have received emergency use authorization1-3, and more treatments are under development4-7. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise8, including two that have an approximately 95% protective efficacy against COVID-199,10. However, these interventions were directed against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in 2019. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK11 and B.1.351 in South Africa12 is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. Here we show that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain of the spike protein and is relatively resistant to a few monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain. It is not more resistant to plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 or sera from individuals who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.351 variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain but also by multiple individual monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding motif of the receptor-binding domain, which is mostly due to a mutation causing an E484K substitution. Moreover, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (9.4-fold) and sera from individuals who have been vaccinated (10.3-12.4-fold).

Common risk factors include older age, chronic illness, obesity, and non-Caucasian race. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with risk for respiratory infections and failure, susceptibility and response to therapy for enveloped virus infection, and immune-mediated inflammatory reaction.Objective: To test the hypothesis that 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] deficiency is a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 respiratory and inflammatory complications.Design: We examined the relationship between prehospitalization 25(OH)D levels (obtained 1-365\u00a0days prior to admission) and COVID-19 clinical outcomes in 700 COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients.Primary Outcomes: Discharge status, mortality, length of stay, intubation status, renal replacement.Secondary Outcomes: Inflammatory markers.Results: 25(OH)D levels were available in 93 patients [25(OH)D:25(IQR:17-33)ng/mL]. Compared to those without 25(OH)D levels, those with measurements did not differ in age, BMI or distribution of sex and race, but were more likely to have comorbidities.

Low 25(OH)D tended to be associated with younger age and lower frequency of preexisting pulmonary disease. There were no significant between-group differences in any outcome. Results were similar in those \u226550\u00a0years, in male/female-only cohorts, and when differing 25(OH)D thresholds were used (<15\u00a0ng/mL and <30\u00a0ng/mL).

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to &gt;5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9\u00a0ng\u00a0ml-1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

We aimed to determine the relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort (n\u2009=\u200952) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS+) bacteria previously linked to inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe periodontitis. Fungal \u03b1-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and plaque from patients with a history of AIDS. Our results show that both bacterial and fungal oral microbiome communities likely play a role in chronic systemic immune activation in PLWH. Thus, interventions targeting both inflammation and the microbiome, particularly in the oral cavity, may be necessary to reduce chronic immune dysregulation in patients with HIV.IMPORTANCE A feedback loop between dysbiotic gut microbiota, increased translocation of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide, and inflammation has been hypothesized to cause immune system dysfunction in early HIV infection. However, despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients. More broadly, these findings can bolster general models of microbiome-mediated chronic systemic immune activation and aid the development of precise microbiota-targeted interventions to reverse chronic inflammation.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "antiretroviral agents", "antiretroviral therapy", "immune dysfunction", "immune system activation", "mycobiome", "oral microbiome"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Bacteria", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Inflammation", "Linear Models", "Middle Aged", "Mycobiome", "Postmenopause", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Saliva"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Medini K", "Last Name": "Annavajhala", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina D", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean B", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jayesh", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Pass", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karolina", "Last Name": "Kister", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Kunen", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Chiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gwenna\u00eblle C", "Last Name": "Monnot", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher L", "Last Name": "Ricupero", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Mazur", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annemieke", "Last Name": "de Jong", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sunil", "Last Name": "Wadhwa", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan T", "Last Name": "Demmer", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA au2110@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2020Feb05"}, {"PMID": "31996422", "Title": "Effect of HIV Envelope Vaccination on the Subsequent Antibody Response to HIV Infection.", "Abstract": "Analysis of breakthrough HIV-1 infections could elucidate whether prior vaccination primes relevant immune responses. Here, we measured HIV-specific antibody responses in 14 South African volunteers who acquired HIV infection after participating in phase 1/2 trials of envelope-containing immunogens. Serum samples were collected annually following HIV-1 infection from participants in trials HVTN 073 (subtype C, DNA/MVA, phase 1 trial, n\u2009=\u20091), HVTN 086 (subtype C, DNA/MVA/gp140 protein, phase 1 trial, n\u2009=\u20092), and HVTN 204 (multisubtype, DNA/adenovirus serotype 5 [Ad5], phase 2 trial, n\u2009=\u20097) and 4 placebo recipients. Binding and neutralizing antibody responses to Env proteins and peptides were determined pre- and post-HIV infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the TZM-bl cell neutralization assay, respectively. HIV-infected South African individuals served as unvaccinated controls. Binding antibodies to gp41, V3, V2, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the CD4 binding site were detected from the first year of HIV-1 subtype C infection, and the levels were similar in vaccinated and placebo recipients. Neutralizing antibody responses against tier 1A viruses were detected in all participants, with the highest titers being to a subtype C virus, MW965.26. No responses were observed just prior to infection, indicating that vaccine-primed HIV-specific antibodies had waned. Sporadic neutralization activity against tier 2 isolates was observed after 2 to 3\u2009years of HIV infection, but these responses were similar in the vaccinated and placebo groups as well as the unvaccinated controls. Our data suggest that prior vaccination with these immunogens did not alter the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection, nor did it accelerate the development of HIV neutralization breadth.IMPORTANCE There is a wealth of information on HIV-specific vaccine-induced immune responses among HIV-uninfected participants; however, data on immune responses among participants who acquire HIV after vaccination are limited. Here we show that HIV-specific binding antibody responses in individuals with breakthrough HIV infections were not affected by prior vaccination with HIV envelope-containing immunogens. We also found that these vectored vaccines did not prime tier 2 virus-neutralizing antibody responses, which are thought to be required for prevention against HIV acquisition, or accelerate the development of neutralization breadth. Although this study is limited, such studies can provide insights into whether vaccine-elicited antibody responses are boosted by HIV infection to acquire broader neutralizing activity, which may help to identify antigens relevant to the design of more effective vaccines.", "Keywords": ["DNA/MVA vaccines", "HIV breakthrough infections", "HIV vaccines", "HIV-1 envelope", "HIV-specific binding

Although renal proximal tubular dysfunction and phosphaturia is common with TDF, it is unknown whether BMD loss results from inadequate mineralization. We evaluated change in BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bone histomorphometry by tetracycline double-labeled transiliac crest biopsies in young men living with HIV before (n\u2009=\u200920) and 12 months after (n\u2009=\u200916) initiating TDF/lamivudine/efavirenz. We examined relationships between calciotropic hormones, urinary phosphate excretion, pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines, and bone remodeling-related proteins with changes in BMD and histomorphometry. Mean age was 29.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5 years, with mean CD4\u2009+\u2009T cell count of 473\u2009\u00b1\u2009196 cells/mm3 . At baseline, decreased bone formation rate and increased mineralization lag time were identified in 16 (80%) and 12 (60%) patients, respectively. After 12 months, we detected a 2% to 3% decrease in lumbar spine and hip BMD by DXA. By histomorphometry, we observed no change in bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and trabecular parameters, but rather, increases in cortical thickness, osteoid volume, and osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces. We did not observe significant worsening of renal phosphate excretion or mineralization parameters. Increases in PTH correlated with decreased BMD but not histomorphometric parameters. Overall, these data suggest abnormalities in bone formation and mineralization occur with HIV infection and are evident at early stages. With TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is an increase in bone remodeling, reflected by increased osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces, but a persistence in mineralization defect, resulting in increased osteoid volume. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE HISTOMORPHOMETRY", "HIV", "PHOSPHATE", "PTH", "TDF"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult",

The role of HIV-related immunosuppression in stroke mechanism is uncertain. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that stroke mechanisms among HIV+ individuals vary according to preceding CD4 counts. We carried out a retrospective chart review of inpatient admissions for ICD-9 defined ischemic events (TIA or stroke) in HIV+ individuals from 2002 to 2016 at a tertiary care center. Stroke mechanisms were ascertained based on radiographic and clinical presentation, and adjudicated by the treating team and confirmed separately by a vascular neurologist. Vascular risk factors, use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), nadir CD4 and current CD4 counts (cells/mm3) were captured to build logistic regressions and generalized linear models to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and beta estimates with their respective 95% confidence intervals. We found that among 115 cases (median age 52, 64% men), stroke mechanisms were 22% due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 17% small artery disease, 16% infectious, 8% cardioembolic, 21% cryptogenic, and 16% other etiologies. The median nadir CD4-count was 153 (IQR 22-274), and 312 (IQR 88-518) at the time of stroke, and 53% were on ARVs. LAA was more common with longer HIV infection (OR 1.1 per year, 1.0-1.2) and nadir CD4 counts <200 (OR 6.7, 1.4-31.9). Stroke due to LAA was associated with higher CD4 count the year prior to stroke (B\u2009=\u20090.009, P\u2009=\u20090.06 for the interaction) independent of CD4 nadir <200 (B\u2009=\u20091.88, P\u2009=\u20090.035). We concluded that in this sample, LAA was the most frequent stroke mechanism among HIV+ individuals with nadir CD4\u2009<\u2009200 but higher CD4 counts near the time of stroke.

The etiology of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in AIDS patients after the initiation of HAART remains unknown. Several researches indicated that the development of IRIS is associated with the production and variation of cytokines, whose gene expression are closely related to the Ca2+/CN-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. Methods. We studied the expression of NFAT isoforms and their major target cytokines genes in peripheral blood CD3+ T cells of subjects through fluorescence quantitative PCR and explored the expression changes of these genes before and after HAART. Results. After the initiation of HARRT, NFAT1, IL-6, and IL-8 gene expression showed a reversal trend in the CD3+ T cells of the IRIS group and changed from low expression before HARRT to high expression after HARRT. In particular, the relative gene expression of NFAT1 was markedly higher compared with the other three isoforms. The IRIS group also showed higher NFAT4, NFAT2, NFAT1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-2, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression than the non-IRIS group. Conclusion. This study suggested that high expression levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 can predict the risk of IRIS. The increased expression of NFAT1 and NFAT4 may promote the expression of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, which may promote the occurrence of IRIS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD3 Complex", "Cytokines", "Female", "Humans", "Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome", "Interleukin-10", "Interleukin-18", "Interleukin-1beta", "Interleukin-6", "Interleukin-8", "Male", "NFATC Transcription Factors", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Heling", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Yirui", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Junwei", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qihui", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}], "Journal": "Mediators of inflammation", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28088742", "Title": "Patterns of drug use and HIV infection among adults in a nationally representative sample.", "Abstract": "Little is known about drug use patterns among people living with HIV in comparison to an uninfected group in the general population.

Long generally perceived as an aberration without clinical consequences in relatively young HIV-infected cohorts, recent studies have documented marked increases in fracture incidence in HIV-infected men and women over a wide age continuum. Fractures are associated with chronic pain, crippling morbidity, and increased mortality, undermining the gains in quality of life achieved though ART. As bone loss and resulting increases in fracture incidence are a natural consequence of aging, there is now concern regarding the long-term consequences of HIV/ART-associated premature bone loss, given the transition of the HIV/AIDS population into an older age demographic. The development of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of bone disease within the context of HIV and ART has been an important recent step in raising awareness of the problem and the implications of bone fracture for patient health. Significant progress has also been made in recent years in dissecting the complex and multifactorial mechanisms driving bone loss in HIV/ART and the role of underlying immunological disruption in skeletal dysmorphogenesis.

To identify blood biomarkers to predict severity and mortality in AIDS PCP patients. Methods. Biomarkers including clinical parameters and plasma inflammatory cytokines were assessed in 32 HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) at time of admission. Predictive value of the biomarkers for clinical severity and in-hospital mortality was evaluated by corresponding ROC curve. Results. Levels of CRP, WBC, LDH, HBDH, and Ferritin were significantly higher in the severe and nonsurvivor AIDS PCP patients. These important biochemical indicators have inverse correlation with oxygenation index, especially levels of LDH (P = 0.008, R (2) = 0.258), HBDH (P = 0.001, R (2) = 0.335), and Ferritin (P = 0.005, R (2) = 0.237). Plasma IL-8 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 200\u2009mmHg and nonsurvivors than in those with PaO2/FiO2 > 200\u2009mmHg and survivors. Severe and nonsurvival groups showed higher ratio of mean IL-6/IL-10 level (1.78 \u00b1 1.56, P < 0.001; 1.11 \u00b1 0.72, P = 0.043), larger AUC (95% CI 0.781-1.000, P < 0.001; 95% CI 0.592-0.917, P = 0.043), and more significantly inverse correlation with the oxygenation index.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture were characterized in 38 HIV-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (18 perinatally-infected, 20 adolescence-infected) and 20 uninfected men age 20 to 25 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CD4+/CD8+ activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28-CD57+) and to quantify circulating osteogenic precursor (COP) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibodies to RUNX2 and osteocalcin (OCN). Telomere lengths were measured in sorted COP cells using qPCR. DXA-derived areal BMD Z-scores and HRpQCT-derived volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected men. Proportion of activated and senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in HIV-infected than uninfected men. The percentage of COP cells (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE) was lower in HIV-infected than uninfected (0.19%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02% versus 0.43%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) men, and also lower in perinatally-infected than adolescence-infected men (0.15%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02% versus 0.22%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03%; p\u2009<\u20090.04). A higher proportion of COP cells correlated with higher bone stiffness, a measure of bone strength, whereas a higher proportion of activated CD4+ T cells correlated with lower BMD and stiffness and lower proportion of COP cells. T cell activation with HIV-infection was associated with decreased numbers of osteogenic precursors as well as lower peak bone mass and bone strength. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["ADOLESCENTS", "BONE ACQUISITION", "HIV", "IMMUNE ACTIVATION", "OSTEOBLASTS"], "MeSH terms": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Biomarkers", "Bone Density", "Bone Remodeling", "Bone and Bones", "Cell Movement", "Cellular Senescence", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Osteogenesis", "Radius", "Stem Cells", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tibia", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Manavalan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Arpadi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Shenthuraan", "Last Name": "Tharmarajah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jayesh", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan A", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Foca", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Neu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kyle K", "Last Name": "Nishiyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2016Nov"}, {"PMID": "27124896", "Title": "Longitudinal increase in vitamin D binding protein levels after initiation of tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz among individuals with HIV.", "Abstract": "To examine longitudinal change in vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels during the first year after initiation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/lamivudine/efavirenz and compare these findings with concurrent changes in markers of skeletal metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alkynes", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Benzoxazines", "Bone Resorption", "Cyclopropanes", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lamivudine", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plasma", "Tenofovir", "Vitamin D-Binding Protein", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evelyn", "Last Name": "Hsieh", "Affiliation": "aDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China bSection of Rheumatology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA cDepartment of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China dSection of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut eDivision of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA fClinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Liana", "Last Name": "Fraenkel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weibo", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karl L", "Last Name": "Insogna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xinqi", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taisheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "AIDS (London, England)", "PubDate": "2016Jul31"}, {"PMID": "27029778", "Title": "Low Risk of Proximal Tubular Dysfunction Associated With Emtricitabine-Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Preexposure Prophylaxis in Men and Women.", "Abstract": "Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with proximal tubular dysfunction (tubulopathy) when used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Researchers have identified certain patient characteristics as predictors of AMA discharges, but the patients' reasons for these events have not been comprehensively explored. Moreover, because the medical authority model dominates this research area, providers' experiences of AMA discharges remain unstudied. We examined the AMA discharge from a patient-centered perspective by analyzing the content of notes providers generate to record such events. We analyzed providers' notes for all inpatients with a primary HIV diagnosis (N\u00a0=\u00a033) that, in 2012, left an urban hospital AMA. Applying the Scott and Lyman accounts framework, we identified that the notes constituted records of providers' and patients' excuses and justifications for failing to meet the expectations of a provider offering patient-centered care and a compliant patient receiving care. Alongside the patients' reasons for leaving AMA, the notes also revealed the providers' reasons for honoring or discrediting the patients' accounts. The style of the accounts and the professional status of the notes' authors enabled us to contextualize the production and sharing of AMA notes in the hospital hierarchy. Conceptualizing AMA notes as dyadic accounts elicited specific factors that challenge the patient-provider relationship, and generated insights on how to strengthen it, and thus decrease the rates of AMA discharges and their associated health effects.", "Keywords": ["Accounts", "Against medical advice", "HIV", "Patient-provider relationship", "United States"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Hospitals, Urban", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Discharge", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Treatment Refusal", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Helen-Maria", "Last Name": "Lekas", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, United States.

Although HIV-infected postmenopausal women had lower aBMD at the spine, total hip, and ultradistal radius and higher levels of bone resorption markers, the only differences detected by HRpQCT were lower cortical thickness and area at the tibia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Bone Density", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Hip", "Humans", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal", "Postmenopause", "Radius"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, PH8-876, New York, NY 10032, USA.
