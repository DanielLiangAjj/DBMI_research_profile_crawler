However, they also engender vulnerability to factors that can perturb developmental trajectories. An understanding of sensitive period phenomena and mechanisms separate from sensory system development is still lacking, yet critical to understanding disease etiology and risk. The dopamine system is pivotal in controlling and shaping adolescent behaviors, and it undergoes heightened plasticity during that time, such that interference with dopamine signaling can have long-lasting behavioral consequences. Here we sought to gain mechanistic insight into this dopamine-sensitive period and its impact on behavior. In mice, dopamine transporter (DAT) blockade from postnatal (P) day 22 to 41 increases aggression and sensitivity to amphetamine (AMPH) behavioral stimulation in adulthood. Here, we refined this sensitive window to P32-41 and identified increased firing of dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo as a neural correlate to altered adult behavior. Aggression can result from enhanced impulsivity and cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine regulates working memory and motivated behavior. Hence, we assessed these behavioral domains and found that P32-41 DAT blockade increases impulsivity but has no effect on cognition, working memory, or motivation in adulthood. Lastly, using optogenetics to drive dopamine neurons, we find that increased VTA but not SNc dopaminergic activity mimics the increase in impulsive behavior in the Go/NoGo task observed after adolescent DAT blockade. Together our data provide insight into the developmental origins of aggression and impulsivity that may ultimately improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for related neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Dopamine", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Amphetamine", "Impulsive Behavior", "Aggression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deepika", "Last Name": "Suri", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giulia", "Last Name": "Zanni", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darshini", "Last Name": "Mahadevia", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nao", "Last Name": "Chuhma", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rinki", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Spivack", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicol\u00f2", "Last Name": "Pini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory S", "Last Name": "Stevens", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Ziolkowski-Blake", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanor H", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Balsam", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Ansorge", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ma2362@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "37034804", "Title": "Medial Prefrontal Cortex Serotonin Input Regulates Cognitive Flexibility in Mice.", "Abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulates cognitive flexibility and emotional behavior.

Most pharmacological agents available to treat these disorders target monoamine systems. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for an individual is a process of trial and error.

These mice show the murine equivalent of anxiety- and depression-like symptoms in adulthood and here we report that these mice are also behaviorally resistant to the antidepressant-like effects of adult SSRI administration. We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through agonism of the mu-opioid receptor instead of targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model. We found that C57BL/6J pups exposed to FLX from postnatal day 2 to 11 (PNFLX, the mouse equivalent in terms of brain development to the human third trimester) showed increased avoidant behaviors as adults that failed to improve, or were even exacerbated, by chronic SSRI treatment.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) results from renin-independent production of aldosterone and is a common cause of hypertension. PA is caused by dysregulated localization of the enzyme aldosterone synthase (Cyp11b2), which is normally restricted to the ZG. Cyp11b2 transcription and aldosterone production are predominantly regulated by AngII activation of the Gq signaling pathway. Here, we report the generation of transgenic mice with Gq-coupled designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) specifically in the adrenal cortex. We show that adrenal-wide ligand activation of Gq DREADD receptors triggered disorganization of adrenal functional zonation, with induction of Cyp11b2 in glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata cells. This result was consistent with increased renin-independent aldosterone production and hypertension. All parameters were reversible following termination of DREADD-mediated Gq signaling. These findings demonstrate that Gq signaling is sufficient for adrenocortical aldosterone production and implicate this pathway in the determination of zone-specific steroid production within the adrenal cortex.
