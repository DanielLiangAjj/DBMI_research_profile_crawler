[{"PMID": "38777216", "Title": "Evolving Strategies for the Management of Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.", "Abstract": "For many years, treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has focused on non-disease-specific therapies. Cardiac myosin modulators (ie, mavacamten and aficamten) reduce the pathologic actin-myosin interactions that are characteristic of HCM, leading to improved cardiac energetics and reduction in hypercontractility. Several recently published randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that mavacamten improves exercise capacity, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and symptoms in patients with obstructive HCM and may delay the need for septal-reduction therapy. Long-term data in real-world populations will be needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of mavacamten. Importantly, HCM is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and not all patients will respond to mavacamten; therefore, careful patient selection and shared decision making will be necessary in guiding the use of mavacamten in obstructive HCM.", "Keywords": ["Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "heart failure", "myosin inhibitor"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lusha W", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Heidi S", "Last Name": "Lumish", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo R", "Last Name": "Sewanan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yuichi J", "Last Name": "Shimada", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mathew S", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Shepard D", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Clerkin", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY.

Because differences in mortality rates after these different SRT methods have not been extensively investigated in real-world settings, in this study compared the 1-year mortality rates after ASA and SM using population-based database. Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: Utilizing New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data from 2005 to 2016, we performed a comparative effectiveness study of ASA vs. SM in patients with HCM. The outcome was all-cause death up to 360 days after SRT. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model and performed sensitivity analysis with propensity score (PS)-matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methods. We identified 755 patients with HCM who underwent SRT: 348 with ASA and 407 with SM. The multivariable analysis showed that all-cause deaths were significantly fewer in the ASA group at 360 days after SRT (adjusted odds ratio=0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.84; P=0.02). The PS-matching and IPTW methods also supported a lower mortality rate in the ASA group at 360 days post-SRT.

"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex but relatively common genetic disease that usually arises from pathogenic variants that disrupt sarcomere function and lead to variable structural, hypertrophic, and fibrotic remodeling of the heart which result in substantial adverse clinical outcomes including arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. HCM has had few effective treatments with the potential to ameliorate disease progression until the recent advent of inhibitory myosin modulators like mavacamten. Preclinical investigations and clinical trials utilizing this treatment targeted to this specific pathophysiological mechanism of sarcomere hypercontractility in HCM have confirmed that myosin modulators can alter disease expression and attenuate hypertrophic remodeling. Here, we summarize the state of hypertrophic remodeling and consider the arguments for and against salutary HCM disease modification using targeted myosin modulators. Further, we consider critical unanswered questions for future investigative and therapeutic avenues in HCM disease modification. We are at the precipice of a new era in understanding and treating HCM, with the potential to target agents toward modifying disease expression and natural history of this most common inherited disease of the heart.", "Keywords": ["fibrosis", "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "hypertrophy", "mavacamten", "myosin modulator", "remodeling", "reverse remodeling"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorenzo R", "Last Name": "Sewanan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuichi J", "Last Name": "Shimada", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36252118", "Title": "Prediction of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Proteomics Profiling.", "Abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often causes major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), for example, arrhythmias, stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.

However, it is largely unknown whether SRT prevents HCM-related cardiovascular events or death. The objective was to examine the effects of SRT on acute cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in HCM. We performed a propensity score (PS) -matched study using databases that capture all hospitalizations and outpatient visits in New York state. We identified patients with HCM who underwent SRT between 2007 and 2014 (i.e. the SRT group) and those who had never had SRT but had at least one hospitalization for HCM during the same period (i.e. the control group). We performed PS matching at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a composite of acute cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality during 0-180 days and 181-360 days. The secondary outcome was 180- and 360-day all-cause mortality. We included 846 patients with HCM (423 PS-matched pairs). Patients who underwent SRT had a lower risk of the primary outcome event (0-180 days: odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.37-0.80; P = 0.002 and 181-360 days: OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower at 180 days (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.63; P = 0.0003) and 360 days post-SRT (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51; P < 0.0001).

On the other hand, genetic testing carries socio-economical and psychological burdens. It is therefore important to identify patients with HCM who are more likely to have positive genotype. However, conventional prediction models based on clinical and echocardiographic parameters offer only modest accuracy and are subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. We therefore hypothesized that deep convolutional neural network (DCNN, a type of deep learning) analysis of echocardiographic images improves the predictive accuracy of positive genotype in patients with HCM. In each case, we obtained parasternal short- and long-axis as well as apical 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-chamber views. We employed DCNN algorithm to predict positive genotype based on the input echocardiographic images. We performed 5-fold cross-validations. We used 2 reference models-the Mayo HCM Genotype Predictor score (Mayo score) and the Toronto HCM Genotype score (Toronto score). We compared the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) between a combined model using the reference model plus DCNN-derived probability and the reference model. We calculated the p-value by performing 1,000 bootstrapping. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, we examined the net reclassification improvement. We included 99 adults with HCM who underwent genetic testing. Overall, 45 patients (45%) had positive genotype. The new model combining Mayo score and DCNN-derived probability significantly outperformed Mayo score (AUC 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.93] vs. 0.72 [0.61-0.82]; p < 0.001). Similarly, the new model combining Toronto score and DCNN-derived probability exhibited a higher AUC compared to Toronto score alone (AUC 0.84 [0.76-0.92] vs. 0.75 [0.65-0.85]; p = 0.03).

The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between the amputation risk and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. The main outcome measure was the risk of amputation. Multiple databases were searched up to February 2020 and data extraction was performed. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which reported risk of amputation with SGLT2 inhibitors over non-SGLT2 inhibitors or placebo. The risk of bias was assessed by Cochrane bias tool. The initial search yielded 1,873 citations and a total of five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The five included studies evaluated a total of 39,067 patients with diabetes mellitus, including 21,395 patients on SGLT2 inhibitors. The incidence rate of amputation ranged from 0.36 to 3.18% in the SGLT2 inhibitor group and from 0% to 2.87% in the control group. Follow up duration ranged from 24\u00a0weeks to 4.2\u00a0years.

We performed a comparative effectiveness study of ASA versus VSM (reference group) among patients with HC who underwent VSRT, using population-based ED and inpatient databases in 3 states, 2005 to 2014. The outcome was acute care use for CVD during a 2-year post-VSRT period. We constructed univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to compare the risk during sequential 6-month periods. We also performed sensitivity analysis with propensity score-matching at 1:1 ratio. We identified 850 patients with HC who underwent VSRT, including 393 with ASA and 457 with VSM.

In the United States, obesity is the nationwide public health issue of the day with the prevalence exceeding 30%. It has become a substantial health and financial burden to the society and national healthcare system; the direct cost accounted for 150 billion US dollars in 2014. Lifestyle interventions have been shown to be successful in the short term, however their long-term results are still equivocal likely due to modest weight reduction and high recurrence rates. For instance, the mean weight reduction in a randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and either overweight or obesity was 6.0% in the intensive lifestyle modification arm and 3.5% in the control arm. On the contrary, bariatric surgery is known to be the most effective in achieving substantial and long-term weight loss and can prevent the development of CVD risk factors such as DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Bariatric surgery induces prompt weight loss within a few months which lasts for at least 12-18 months, with mean weight loss of ~35% (~70% loss of excess weight), lowering the risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that bariatric surgery contributed to the reduction of acute care use for HF, CAD, and hypertension. On the other hand, it was reported that bariatric surgery may worsen the control of certain types of CVD (e.g., dysrhythmia), especially in the early postoperative period. Additionally, the notion that being overweight or obese could contribute to higher survival rate in certain populations (e.g., patients with HF)-also known as \"obesity paradox\"-has been repetitively documented in the past, while most recent investigations suggested that the observed paradox may be attributable to confounding factors including pre-existing comorbidities. Considering the aforementioned advances in the field, this paper reviews a series of recent studies with regard to the short-term and long-term effects of bariatric surgery on various types of CVDs.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "bariatric surgery", "cardiovascular disease", "coronary artery disease", "heart failure", "hypertension", "obesity", "venous thromboembolism"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Toshiki", "Last Name": "Kuno", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eriko", "Last Name": "Tanimoto", "Affiliation": "Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Sae", "Last Name": "Morita", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuichi J", "Last Name": "Shimada", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31323338", "Title": "Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Asthma Exacerbation: A Population-Based, Self-Controlled Case Series Study.", "Abstract": "Patients with asthma have a high incidence of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.", "Keywords": ["Asthma exacerbation", "Ischemic stroke", "Myocardial infarction", "Self-controlled case series design"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Asthma", "Brain Ischemia", "Humans", "Incidence", "Ischemic Stroke", "Myocardial Infarction", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yoshihiko", "Last Name": "Raita", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.

Methods This is a self-controlled case series study using the population-based emergency department (ED) and inpatient databases of 5 US states from 2007 through 2012. Among patients with existing AF, we identified patients with an AECOPD hospitalization and at least 1 ED visit or hospitalization for AF during the observation period. We constructed conditional Poisson regression models to compare the rate of AF-related ED visits or hospitalizations during sequential 90-day periods after the AECOPD hospitalization, with pre-AECOPD days 1 to 90 as the reference. Results We analyzed 944 patients who were hospitalized for AECOPD and had an ED visit or hospitalization for AF during a 450-day period. The median age was 77 years, and 41% were men. Compared with the reference period, the rate of AF-related ED visits or hospitalizations significantly increased in the post-AECOPD days 1 to 90 (7.3 versus 14.1 per 100 person-months; rate ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.63-2.29; P<0.001). Then, the rate decreased to the reference level in the post-AECOPD days 91 to 180 (7.5 per 100 person-months; rate ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.25; P=0.77) and remained at the reference level during post-AECOPD days 181 to 270 (rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68-1.03; P=0.09) and days 271 to 360 (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.10; P=0.29).

The risk remained similar in the subsequent 12-month presurgery period (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.29 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.76] p\u2009=\u20090.11). In contrast, the risk significantly increased within 12 months after bariatric surgery (aOR 1.53 [95% CI 1.13 to 2.07] p\u2009=\u20090.006). The risk remained elevated during 13-24 months after bariatric surgery (aOR 1.41 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.91] p\u2009=\u20090.03). In conclusion, this population-based study demonstrated that bariatric surgery was associated with an increased risk of AF episodes requiring an ED visit or hospitalization for at least 2 years after surgery among obese patients with AF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Bariatric Surgery", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hospital Mortality", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Morbidity", "Obesity", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuichi J", "Last Name": "Shimada", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Advances in molecular biology and gene targeting approaches are offering further novel options for genetic manipulation of the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to improve cardiac function in chronic HF by overexpressing constitutively active inhibitor-1 (I-1c) using a novel cardiotropic vector generated by capsid reengineering of adeno-associated virus (BNP116). One month after a large anterior myocardial infarction, 20 Yorkshire pigs randomly received intracoronary injection of either high-dose BNP116.I-1c (1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910(13) vector genomes (vg), n = 7), low-dose BNP116.I-1c (3.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910(12) vg, n = 7), or saline (n = 6). Compared to baseline, mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 5.7% in the high-dose group, and by 5.2% in the low-dose group, whereas it decreased by 7% in the saline group. Additionally, preload-recruitable stroke work obtained from pressure-volume analysis demonstrated significantly higher cardiac performance in the high-dose group. Likewise, other hemodynamic parameters, including stroke volume and contractility index indicated improved cardiac function after the I-1c gene transfer. Furthermore, BNP116 showed a favorable gene expression pattern for targeting the heart. In summary, I-1c overexpression using BNP116 improves cardiac function in a clinically relevant model of ischemic HF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dependovirus", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Injections, Intra-Arterial", "Myocardial Infarction", "Protein Phosphatase 1", "Stroke Volume", "Swine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kiyotake", "Last Name": "Ishikawa", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Fish", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Tilemann", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kleopatra", "Last Name": "Rapti", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaume", "Last Name": "Aguero", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlos G", "Last Name": "Santos-Gallego", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahyoung", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ioannis", "Last Name": "Karakikes", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chaoqin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fadi G", "Last Name": "Akar", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuichi J", "Last Name": "Shimada", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, University Hospital and Manhattan Campus for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith K", "Last Name": "Gwathmey", "Affiliation": "Gwathmey Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aravind", "Last Name": "Asokan", "Affiliation": "Gene Therapy Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "McPhee", "Affiliation": "Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Chapel Hill, NC."}, {"First Name": "Jade", "Last Name": "Samulski", "Affiliation": "Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Chapel Hill, NC."}, {"First Name": "Richard Jude", "Last Name": "Samulski", "Affiliation": "Gene Therapy Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Sigg", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evangelia G", "Last Name": "Kranias", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Cell Biophysics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger J", "Last Name": "Hajjar", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.
