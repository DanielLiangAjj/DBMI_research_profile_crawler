However, how meningeal immunity is altered in human neurodegeneration and its effects on CNS inflammation is understudied. We performed the first single-cell analysis of the transcriptomes and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of 104,635 immune cells from 55 postmortem human brain and leptomeningeal tissues from donors with neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. RNA and TCR sequencing from paired leptomeninges and brain allowed us to perform lineage tracing to identify the spatial trajectory of clonal T cells in the CNS and its borders. We propose that T cells activated in the brain emigrate to and establish residency in the leptomeninges where they likely contribute to impairments in lymphatic drainage and remotely to CNS inflammation by producing IFN\u03b3 and other cytokines. We identified regulatory networks local to the meninges including NK cell-mediated CD8 T cell killing which likely help to control meningeal inflammation. Collectively, these findings provide not only a foundation for future studies into brain border immune surveillance but also highlight important intercellular dynamics that could be leveraged to modulate neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Hobson", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel H S", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Harrison", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Ciener", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hasini", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Chitra", "Last Name": "Singal", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine Y", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Shneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Neurobiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2024Jan24"}, {"PMID": "37644110", "Title": "A cell-based assay for rapid assessment of ACE2 catalytic function.", "Abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is a monocarboxypeptidase expressed throughout multiple tissues and its catalysis of bioactive peptides regulates the renin-angiotensin system mediating blood pressure homeostasis. ACE2 is implicated in a variety of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, and is the obligate entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disease-associated genetic variants of ACE2 are increasingly being identified but are poorly characterized. To aid this problem, we introduce a fluorometric cell-based assay for evaluating surface-expressed ACE2 catalytic activity that preserves the native glycosylation of the host environment and is amenable to high-throughput analysis of ACE2 variants in multi-well plates. We demonstrate sensitivity to detecting catalysis of the key ACE2 substrates, Angiotensin II, Apelin-13, and des-Arg9-bradykinin, and impact of a catalytically-deficient ACE2 variant. Normalizing catalytic measures to surface ACE2 expression accounts for variability in ACE2 variant transfection, surface delivery or stability. This assay provides a convenient and powerful approach for investigating the catalytic characteristics of ACE2 variants involved in cardiovascular peptide cascades and homeostasis of multiple organs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "Angiotensin II", "Catalysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Warren M", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ryan J", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Wun Chey", "Last Name": "Sin", "Affiliation": "Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kurt", "Last Name": "Haas", "Affiliation": "Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. kurt.haas@ubc.ca."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2023Aug29"}, {"PMID": "36467826", "Title": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms in SAR1A coding regions in sickle cell disease and their potential miRNA binding sites.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["SAR1A", "hydroxyurea", "miRNA", "sickle cell disease", "single nucleotide polymorphisms"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chutima", "Last Name": "Kumkhaek", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda Maryland USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda Maryland USA."}, {"First Name": "Gulriz", "Last Name": "Kurban", "Affiliation": "Center for Sickle Cell Disease Howard University Washington District of Columbia USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianqiong", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda Maryland USA."}, {"First Name": "Wulin", "Last Name": "Aerbajinai", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda Maryland USA."}, {"First Name": "James G", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Center for Sickle Cell Disease Howard University Washington District of Columbia USA."}, {"First Name": "Griffin P", "Last Name": "Rodgers", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda Maryland USA."}], "Journal": "EJHaem", "PubDate": "2022Nov"}, {"PMID": "35646424", "Title": "The Conundrum of Dystonia in Essential Tremor Patients: How does One Classify these Cases?", "Abstract": "The relationship between essential tremor (ET) and dystonia has been long debated and the boundaries between these disorders remain unclear.

To do this, we used a coculture system of macrophages and fibroblasts paired with transcriptomic analyses to comprehensively characterize the modulation of inflammatory responses by PRP in vitro. Relying on patient-reported outcomes and achievement of minimal clinically important differences in OA patients receiving PRP injections, we identified responders and non-responders to the treatment.

One hundred and sixty-one ET and 80 age-matched control subjects drew 10 consecutive spirals on a digitizing tablet. Degree of severity (DoS), a weighted, computational score of spiral execution that takes into account spiral shape and line smoothness, previously validated against a clinical rating scale, was calculated in both groups. Tremor amplitude (Ampl), an independent index of tremor size, measured in centimeters, was also calculated. Changes in DoS and Ampl across trials were assessed using linear regression with slope evaluations. Both groups demonstrated improvement in DoS across trials, but with less improvement in the ET group compared to controls. Ampl demonstrated a tendency to worsen across trials in ET subjects. ET subjects demonstrated less improvement than controls when drawing sequential spirals, suggesting a possible motor learning deficit in ET, here captured in an affected limb.

The esterification reactions are allosterically activated by their sterol substrates, the majority of which accumulate at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that in yeast, sterol transport from the plasma membrane to the site of esterification is associated with the physical interaction of the major SOAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-related enzyme (Are)2p, with 2 plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: Aus1p and Pdr11p. Are2p, Aus1p, and Pdr11p, unlike the minor acyltransferase, Are1p, colocalize to sterol and sphingolipid-enriched, detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs). Deletion of either ABC transporter results in Are2p relocalization to detergent-soluble membrane domains and a significant decrease (53-36%) in esterification of exogenous sterol. Similarly, in murine tissues, the SOAT1/Acat1 enzyme and activity localize to DRMs. This subcellular localization is diminished upon deletion of murine ABC transporters, such as Abcg1, which itself is DRM associated. We propose that the close proximity of sterol esterification and transport proteins to each other combined with their residence in lipid-enriched membrane microdomains facilitates rapid, high-capacity sterol transport and esterification, obviating any requirement for soluble intermediary proteins.", "Keywords": ["ABC transporter", "cholesteryl ester", "lipid droplet", "sterol transport"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Animals", "Esterification", "Lipoproteins", "Membrane Microdomains", "Mice", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Sterol O-Acyltransferase", "Sterols"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sonia", "Last Name": "Gulati", "Affiliation": "*Institute of Human Nutrition, Department of Neurology, **Department of Genetics and Development, and Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA;
