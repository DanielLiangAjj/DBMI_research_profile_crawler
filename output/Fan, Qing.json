The objective of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of A.\u2009villosum in a rat model of alcohol-induced liver disease, thereby establishing a scientific foundation for the potential preventive use of A.\u2009villosum in ALD. We established a Chinese liquor (Baijiu)-induced liver injury model in rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, in combination with biochemical tests, was used to evaluate the protective effects of A.\u2009villosum on the liver. The integration of network medicine analysis with experimental validation was used to explore the hepatoprotective effects and potential mechanisms of A.\u2009villosum in rats. Our findings showed that A.\u2009villosum ameliorated alcohol-induced changes in body weight, liver index, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, blood lipid metabolism, and liver function in rats. Network proximity analysis was employed to identify 18 potentially active ingredients of A.\u2009villosum for ALD treatment.

In this research, a PD-L1-antagonistic affibody dimer (ZPD-L1) was successfully prepared through Escherichia coli expression system, and conjugated with the photosensitizer of ICG via N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester to develop a novel tumor-targeting agent (ICG-ZPD-L1) for both tumor imaging diagnosis and photothermal-immunotherapy simultaneously. In vitro, ZPD-L1 could specifically bind to PD-L1-positive LLC and MC38 tumor cells, and ICG-ZPD-L1-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) also showed excellent phototoxicity to these tumor cells. In vivo, ICG-ZPD-L1 selectively enriched into the PD-L1-positive MC38 tumor tissues, and the high-contrast optical imaging of tumors was obtained. ICG-ZPD-L1-mediated PTT exhibited a potent anti-tumor effect in vivo due to its remarkable photothermal properties. Furthermore, ICG-ZPD-L1-mediated PTT significantly induced the immunogenic cell death (ICD) of primary tumors, promoted maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), up-regulated anti-tumor immune response, enhanced immunotherapy, and superiorly inhibited the growth of metastatic tumors. In addition, ICG-ZPD-L1 showed favorable biosafety throughout the brief duration of treatment.

Previous studies have shown that IFITM3 is upregulated in various tissues and organs after avian reovirus (ARV) infection, which suggests that IFITM3 may be involved in the antiviral response after ARV infection. In this study, the chicken IFITM3 gene was cloned and analyzed bioinformatically. Then, the role of chicken IFITM3 in ARV infection was further explored. The results showed that the molecular weight of the chicken IFITM3 protein was approximately 13 kDa. This protein was found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm, and its protein structure contained the CD225 domain. The homology analysis and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the IFITM3 genes of different species exhibited great variation during genetic evolution, and chicken IFITM3 shared the highest homology with that of Anas platyrhynchos and displayed relatively low homology with those of birds such as Anser cygnoides and Serinus canaria. An analysis of the distribution of chicken IFITM3 in tissues and organs revealed that the IFITM3 gene was expressed at its highest level in the intestine and in large quantities in immune organs, such as the bursa of Fabricius, thymus and spleen. Further studies showed that the overexpression of IFITM3 in chicken embryo fibroblasts (DF-1) could inhibit the replication of ARV, whereas the inhibition of IFITM3 expression in DF-1 cells promoted ARV replication. In addition, chicken IFITM3 may exert negative feedback regulatory effects on the expression of TBK1, IFN-\u03b3 and IRF1 during ARV infection, and it is speculated that IFITM3 may participate in the innate immune response after ARV infection by negatively regulating the expression of TBK1, IFN-\u03b3 and IRF1.

Radiotherapy plays an important role in clinical treatment of lung cancer. However, the effect of radiotherapy is not ideal due to the radiation resistance of tumor tissues. Abnormalities in tumor vascular structure and function affect blood perfusion, and oxygen transport is impeded, making tumor microenvironment hypoxic. Tumor hypoxia is the major cause of radiotherapy resistance. By promoting tumor vessel normalization and enhancing vascular transport function, tumor hypoxia can be relieved to reduce radiotherapy resistance and increase tumor radiotherapy sensitivity. In our previous study, a pericytes-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha (named Z-TNF\u03b1) was first constructed and produced by genetically fusing the platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-antagonistic affibody (ZPDGFR\u03b2) to the TNF\u03b1, and the Z-TNF\u03b1 induced normalization of tumor vessels and improved the delivery of doxorubicin, enhancing tumor chemotherapy. In this study, the tumor vessel normalization effect of Z-TNF\u03b1 in lung cancer was further clarified. Moreover, the tumor hypoxia improvement and radiosensitizing effect of Z-TNF\u03b1 were emphatically explored in vivo. Inspiringly, Z-TNF\u03b1 specifically accumulated in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor graft and relieved tumor hypoxia as well as inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 expression.

The proportion of MSI-high (MSI-H) was 7.8%.Subsequent multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant associations including a link between lung metastasis and KRAS mutation, between liver metastasis and lymph node metastasis, between MSI-H and early-onset CRC (EOCRC) and KRAS mutation, between right-sided colon cancer and peritoneal metastasis, and between PIK3CA mutation and PTEN mutation. Patients with KRAS mutation presented with MSI-H, lung metastasis, and PIK3CA mutation. MSI-H, BRAF mutation, and PTEN mutation were more frequent in EOCRC. Phosphorylation and ubiquitylation were found in KRAS, BRAF, PTEN, and SMAD4; SUMOylation and ubiquitylation were observed in HRAS and NRAS; while phosphorylation was obvious in APC, P53, and MLH1.

The spleen plays a very important part in protecting hosts against infectious pathogens. In this research, transcriptome and translatome sequencing technology were combined to investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional and translational regulation in the spleen after ARV infection. On a genome-wide scale, ARV infection can significantly reduce the translation efficiency (TE) of splenic genes. Differentially expressed translational efficiency genes (DTEGs) were identified, including 15 upregulated DTEGs and 396 downregulated DTEGs. These DTEGs were mainly enriched in immune regulation signaling pathways, which indicates that ARV infection reduces the innate immune response in the spleen. In addition, combined analyses revealed that the innate immune response involves the effects of transcriptional and translational regulation. Moreover, we discovered the key gene IL4I1, the most significantly upregulated gene at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Further studies in DF1 cells showed that overexpression of IL4I1 could inhibit the replication of ARV, while inhibiting the expression of endogenous IL4I1 with siRNA promoted the replication of ARV. Overexpression of IL4I1 significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2, LGP2, TBK1 and NF-\u03baB; however, the expression of these genes was significantly upregulated after inhibition of IL4I1, suggesting that IL4I1 may be a negative feedback effect of innate immune signaling pathways. In addition, there may be an interaction between IL4I1 and ARV \u03c3A protein, and we speculate that the IL4I1 protein plays a regulatory role by interacting with the \u03c3A protein. This study not only provides a new perspective on the regulatory mechanisms of the innate immune response after ARV infection but also enriches the knowledge of the host defense mechanisms against ARV invasion and the outcome of ARV evasion of the host's innate immune response.", "Keywords": ["IL4I1", "Ribo-seq", "avian reovirus", "innate immunity", "spleen", "translatomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chickens", "Transcriptome", "Orthoreovirus, Avian", "Spleen", "Immunity, Innate", "Signal Transduction", "Gene Expression Profiling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Tengda", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Division of Liver Surgery, Department of General Surgery, Laboratory of Liver Surgery, and State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhixun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "NHC Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Frontiers Science Center for Disease-Related Molecular Network, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Liji", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Sisi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaoling", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanfang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "Minxiu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}, {"First Name": "You", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning 530000, China."}], "Journal": "Viruses", "PubDate": "2023Nov29"}, {"PMID": "38109409", "Title": "Fast and accurate wideband sparse spatial spectrum estimation in an underwater strong interference environment.", "Abstract": "Wideband sparse spatial spectrum estimation is an important direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method that can obtain a high resolution with few snapshots and a low signal-to-noise ratio.

To date, research on IFI6 has mainly focused on human malignant tumors, virus-related diseases and autoimmune diseases. Previous studies have shown that IFI6 plays an important role in antiviral, antiapoptotic and tumor-promoting cellular functions, but few studies have focused on the structure or function of avian IFI6. Avian reovirus (ARV) is an important virus that can exert immunosuppressive effects on poultry. Preliminary studies have shown that IFI6 expression is upregulated in various tissues and organs of specific-pathogen-free chickens infected with ARV, suggesting that IFI6 plays an important role in ARV infection. To analyze the function of avian IFI6, particularly in ARV infection, the chicken IFI6 gene was cloned, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted, and the roles of IFI6 in ARV replication and the innate immune response were investigated after the overexpression or knockdown of IFI6 in vitro. The results indicated that the molecular weight of the chicken IFI6 protein was approximately 11 kDa and that its structure was similar to that of the human IFI27L1 protein. A phylogenetic tree analysis of the IFI6 amino acid sequence revealed that the evolution of mammals and birds was clearly divided into two branches. The evolutionary history and homology of chickens are similar to those of other birds. Avian IFI6 localized to the cytoplasm and was abundantly expressed in the chicken lung, intestine, pancreas, liver, spleen, glandular stomach, thymus, bursa of Fabricius and trachea. Further studies demonstrated that IFI6 overexpression in DF-1 cells inhibited ARV replication and that the inhibition of IFI6 expression promoted ARV replication.

Variations in microstructure of cerebral white matter across individuals and even across fiber tracts might underlie differences in cognitive capacity and vulnerabilities to mental disorders. The frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks of the brain constitute the central system supporting cognitive functions, and functional connectivity of these networks has been used to distinguish individuals known as \"functional fingerprinting.\" The frontal aslant tract (FAT) that passes through the two networks has been implicated in executive functions. However, whether FAT can be used as a \"structural fingerprint\" to distinguish individuals and predict an individual's cognitive function and dysfunction is unknown. Here we investigated the fingerprinting property of FAT microstructural profiles using three independent diffusion MRI datasets with repeated scans on human participants including both females and males. We found that diffusion and geometric profiles of FAT can be used to distinguish individuals with a high accuracy. Next, we demonstrated that fractional anisotropy in different FAT segments predicted distinct cognitive functions, including working memory, inhibitory control, and relational reasoning. Finally, we assessed the contribution of altered FAT microstructural profiles to cognitive dysfunction in unmedicated patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders. We found that the altered microstructure in FAT was associated with the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Collectively, our findings suggest that the microstructural profiles of FAT can identify individuals with a high accuracy and may serve as an imaging marker for predicting an individual's cognitive capacity and disease severity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The frontoparietal network and cingulo-opercular network of the brain constitute a dual-network architecture for human cognitive functions, and functional connectivity of these two networks can be used as a \"functional fingerprint\" to distinguish individuals. However, the structural underpinnings of these networks subserving individual heterogeneities in their functional connectivity and cognitive ability remain unknown. We show here that the frontal aslant tract (FAT) that passes through the two networks distinguishes individuals with a high accuracy. Further, we demonstrate that the diffusion profiles of FAT predict distinct cognitive functions in healthy subjects and are associated with the clinical symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders. Our findings suggest that the FAT may serve as a unique structural fingerprint underlying individual cognitive capability.", "Keywords": ["brain fingerprinting", "cognitive capacity", "diffusion tensor imaging", "mental disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Humans", "Brain", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Cognition", "Executive Function", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danni", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200030, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Neuroimaging Research Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21224."}, {"First Name": "Hongjian", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Center for Brain Imaging Science and Technology, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrumental Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yihong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Neuroimaging Research Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21224 yihongyang@intra.nida.nih.gov yaoli@sjtu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, People's Republic of China yihongyang@intra.nida.nih.gov yaoli@sjtu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023Oct18"}, {"PMID": "37573423", "Title": "Integrating animal experiments, mass spectrometry and network-based approach to reveal the sleep-improving effects of Ziziphi Spinosae Semen and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid mixture.", "Abstract": "Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS) is a plant widely used as medicine and food in Asian countries due to its numerous health benefits. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a non-proteinaceous amino acid, is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters with a relaxant function.

The phylogenetic tree of these sequences could be divided into 6 distinct ChPV/TuPV groups. More importantly, 3 novel ChPV/TuPV groups were identified for the first time. Recombination analysis with RDP 5.0 revealed 15 recombinants in 35 ChPV/TuPV isolates. These recombination events were further confirmed by Simplot 3.5.1 analysis.

Nanocoating for LAB provides an integrity dense or smooth layer attributed to the cross-linking and assembly of the protectant. The synergism of multiple chemical forces allows for the formation of subtle coatings, including electrostatic attractions, hydrophobic interactions, \u03c0-\u03c0, and metallic bonds.

However, they also face issues such as degradation and metabolism. Carrier-free nanoplatforms consisting of active drugs can effectively avoid the security issues associated with additional carrier ingredients. Herein, a biomimetic carrier-free nanoplatform (HESN@CM) was designed to treat cancer by modulating cascade metabolic pathways of ferroptosis. CCR2-overexpressing macrophage membrane-modified HESN can target cancer cells via the CCR2-CCL2 axis. The acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) can disrupt the supramolecular interaction of HESN, releasing hemin and erastin. Then, erastin could induce cancer cells ferroptosis by inhibiting system XC- pathways, while hemin, a vital component of blood to transport oxygen, could be broken down by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), increasing the intracellular Fe2+ concentration to induce cancer cells' ferroptosis further. Meanwhile, erastin could enhance the activity of HO-1, further promoting the release of Fe2+ from hemin.

Interventions that are effective for adult OCD cannot simply be generalized to pediatric OCD, since OCD in children and adolescents usually has a different clinical presentation, etiology and course from adult OCD. Delayed and inadequate treatment is associated with a worse prognosis, making the need for early identification and intervention in pediatric OCD very urgent. In this paper, we reflected on the current constraints that make early interventions for pediatric OCD unpromoted and reviewed the approaches with potential application for early identification and early intervention in pediatric OCD, categorized by three-level prevention stages corresponding to a clinical staging model. Since the etiology of pediatric OCD is still unclear, primary prevention is most lacking, and early interventions for pediatric OCD are currently focused on the secondary prevention stage, which aims to prevent the conversion of obsessive-compulsive symptoms into full-blown OCD; tertiary prevention mostly focuses on the alleviation of mild to moderate OCD, while interventions for co-morbidities are still in their infancy.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry is mediated by a set of glycoproteins that interact to trigger the viral fusion protein glycoprotein B (gB). In the current model, receptor-binding by gD signals a gH/gL heterodimer to trigger a refolding event in gB that fuses the membranes. To explore functional interactions between gB and gH/gL, we used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate two HSV-1 mutants that show a small plaque phenotype due to changes in gB. We passaged the viruses to select for restoration of plaque size and analyzed second-site mutations that arose in gH. HSV-1 gB was replaced either by gB from saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1) or by a mutant form of HSV-1 gB with three alanine substitutions in domain V (gB3A). To shift the selective pressure away from gB, the gB3A virus was passaged in cells expressing gB3A. Sequencing of passaged viruses identified two interesting mutations in gH, including gH-H789Y in domain IV and gH-S830N in the cytoplasmic tail (CT). Characterization of these gH mutations indicated they are responsible for the enhanced plaque size. Rather than being globally hyperfusogenic, both gH mutations partially rescued function of the specific gB version present during their selection. These sites may represent functional interaction sites on gH/gL for gB. gH-H789 may alter the positioning of a membrane-proximal flap in the gH ectodomain, whereas gH-S830 may contribute to an interaction between the gB and gH CTs. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses enter cells by fusing their envelope with the host cell membrane. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry requires the coordinated interaction of several viral glycoproteins, including gH/gL and gB. gH/gL and gB are essential for virus replication and both proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies. gB fuses the membranes after being activated by gH/gL, but the details of how gH/gL activates gB are not known. This study examined the gH/gL-gB interaction using HSV-1 mutants that displayed reduced virus entry due to changes in gB. The mutant viruses were grown over time to select for additional mutations that could partially restore entry. Two mutations in gH (H789Y and S830N) were identified. The positions of the mutations in gH/gL may represent sites that contribute to gB activation during virus entry.", "Keywords": ["Saimiriine herpesvirus 1", "cell-cell fusion", "entry", "fusion", "glycoprotein B", "glycoprotein H", "glycoproteins", "herpes simplex virus type 1", "herpesviruses", "mutation", "plaque", "revertant", "structure", "syncytia", "virus entry"], "MeSH terms": ["Viral Envelope Proteins", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Glycoproteins", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Virus Internalization", "Membrane Fusion"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel P", "Last Name": "Hippler", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yueqi", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Yuanpei College, Peking University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Longnecker", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2023Feb28"}, {"PMID": "36622371", "Title": "A multiplex fluorescence-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for identifying chicken parvovirus, chicken infectious anaemia virus, and fowl aviadenovirus serotype 4.", "Abstract": "Chicken parvovirus (ChPV), chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) and fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) are avian viruses that have emerged in recent years and have endangered the global poultry industry, causing great economic loss.

Three primer sets and composite probes were designed according to the conserved regions of the NS gene of ChPV, VP1 gene of CIAV and hexon gene of FAdV-4. Each composite probe was labelled with a different fluorophore, which was detached to release the fluorescence signal after amplification.

Character strengths, which are trait-like positive personality characteristics, have also been found to be closely related to decreased stress and suicidal ideation. However, it is unclear whether character strengths act as a transfer mechanism that links childhood traumatic experiences with perceived stress and eventually suicidal ideation. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This study found that character strengths and perceived stress serially mediated the association between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation. Specifically, childhood trauma was associated with inferior character strengths, and the impaired character strengths further triggered high perceived stress, which was finally linked to a heightened risk of suicidal ideation. This study provided important theoretical implications for preventing suicidal risk among adolescents who are exposed to traumatic events during childhood. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: This study highlighted the roles of character strengths and perceived stress in the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and suicidal ideation, which provided suggestions for designing nursing interventions to reduce adolescents' suicidal ideation, especially for those with traumatic childhood experiences. In addition to family nursing, school-based regular monitoring and interventions of character strengths and perceived stress are necessary. ABSTRACT: Aim This study sought to examine the mediating effects of character strengths and perceived stress on the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation among adolescents. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 1069 Chinese adolescents. The Chinese versions of the Suicidal Ideation Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale and Character Scale for Adolescents were used to assess adolescents' suicidal ideation, childhood trauma, perceived stress and character strengths. Results The findings showed that childhood trauma influenced suicidal ideation directly and indirectly via perceived stress. Moreover, character strengths and perceived stress serially mediated the association between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation, implying that childhood trauma was associated with inferior character strengths, and the impaired character strengths further triggered high perceived stress, which was finally linked to a heightened risk of suicidal ideation. Conclusions This study highlighted the joint contribution of childhood trauma, character strengths and perceived stress to suicidal ideation, providing theoretical and practical implications to guide mental health nurses to reduce the suicide risk among adolescents.

Third, the electrodes were incubated with bovine serum albumin, four different avian reovirus (ARV) immunosensors were obtained. Last, the four ARV immunosensors were used to detect ARV. The results showed that the ARV immunosensors immobilized via Glu, EDC/NHS, direct incubation or CH showed detection limits of 100.63 EID50\u00a0mL-1, 100.48 EID50\u00a0mL-1, 100.37 EID50\u00a0mL-1 and 100.46 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV (S/N\u2009=\u20093) and quantification limits of 101.15 EID50\u00a0mL-1, and 101.00 EID50\u00a0mL-1, 100.89 EID50\u00a0mL-1 and 100.98 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV (S/N\u2009=\u200910), respectively, while the linear range of the immunosensor immobilized via CH (0-105.82 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV) was 10 times broader than that of the immunosensor immobilized via direct incubation (0-104.82 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV) and 100 times broader than those of the immunosensors immobilized via Glu (0-103.82 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV) or EDC/NHS (0-103.82 EID50\u00a0mL-1 ARV).

"Abstract": "The treatment of subcutaneous abscesses has been greatly hindered due to the spread of drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, alternative strategies are highly desired to complement conventional antibiotic therapies and surgical intervention. As one of such strategies, applications of nitric oxide (NO) have shown great potential in the treatment of bacteria-induced subcutaneous abscesses by improving the efficacy of many therapeutic methods. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve precise delivery and controlled release because of its gaseous nature. In the present study, an effective strategy was reported in which on demand hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-activated nitric oxide-releasing vancomycin (Van)-loaded electrostatic complexation (Lipo/Van@Arg) was fabricated. In this system, Van was encapsulated into a negative-charged DSPG/Chol liposome (Lipo/Van) and electrostatically bound with the positive-charged l-arginine (l-Arg). As expected, Lipo/Van@Arg exhibited superior bacterial binding and biofilm penetration abilities. After being in the interior of the biofilms, Lipo/Van@Arg could be triggered by the endogenous H2O2 and effectively release NO. The released NO could exhibit combined antibacterial and biofilm eradication effects with Van. Moreover, an in vivo evaluation using a BALB/c mouse model of subcutaneous abscesses indicated that the combination treatment of NO and Van based on Lipo/Van@Arg could effectively eliminate MRSA from the abscesses, thereby preventing abscess recurrence. In summary, the Lipo/Van@Arg system developed in this study realized controlled delivery and precise release of NO, which had significant clinical implications in the efficient treatment of abscesses.", "Keywords": ["electrostatic complexation", "hydrogen peroxide", "methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)", "nitric oxide", "subcutaneous abscesses"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Vancomycin", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Nitric Oxide", "Abscess", "Static Electricity", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiangjun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shandong New Drug Loading and Release Technology and Preparation Engineering Laboratory, Binzhou Medical University, 346 Guanhai Road, Yantai264003, P.

However, due to the special interpretation methods of this technology for reaction results, all the previously reported LAMP detection methods have been restricted to identifying a single target, which limits the application of this technology. In this study, we modified conventional LAMP to include a quencher-fluorophore composite probe complementary to the F1c segment of the inner primer FIP; upon strand separation, a gain in the visible fluorescent signal was observed. The probes could be labeled with different fluorophores, showing different colors at the corresponding wavelengths. Therefore, this multiplex LAMP (mLAMP) assay can simultaneously detect 1-3 target sequences in a single LAMP reaction tube, and the results are more accurate and intuitive. In this study, we comprehensively demonstrated a single-reaction mLAMP assay for the robust detection of three cattle viruses without nonspecific amplification of other related pathogenic cattle viruses.

Notably, with the time-dependent decline of antibody, 1-dose or 2-dose vaccination strategy seemed not to be enough to provide immune protection against the emerging variants.

Compared with the neutralizing antibody titers against BA.2, marked reductions are observed against BA.2.75 in both 2-dose and 3-dose vaccine groups. In addition, although BA.2 breakthrough infections induce a certain cross-neutralization capacity against later Omicron subvariants, the original antigenic sin phenomenon largely limits the improvement of variant-specific antibody response.

The Her2-specific Affibody (ZHer2:2891) has been clinically tested in patients with Her2-positive breast cancer and is regarded as an ideal drug carrier for tumor diagnosis and targeted treatment. Indocyanine green (ICG) can be used as a photosensitizer for photothermal therapy (PTT), in addition to fluorescent dyes for tumor imaging. In this study, a dimeric Her2-specific Affibody (ZHer2) based on ZHer2:2891 was prepared using the E. coli expression system and then coupled to ICG through an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester reactive group to construct a novel bifunctional protein drug (named ICG-ZHer2) for tumor diagnosis and PTT. In vitro, ICG-ZHer2-mediated PTT selectively and efficiently killed Her2-positive BT-474 and SKOV-3 tumor cells rather than Her2-negative HeLa tumor cells. In vivo, ICG-ZHer2 specifically accumulated in Her2-positive SKOV-3 tumor grafts rather than Her2-negative HeLa tumor grafts; high-contrast tumor optical images were obtained. However, Her2-negative HeLa tumor grafts were not detected.

Previous studies suggested that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) process decision-making differently from healthy controls. Both their compulsive behavior and obsessive thoughts may influence the evidence accumulation process, yet the previous studies disagreed on the reason. To address this question, we employed a probabilistic reasoning task in which subjects made two alternative forced choices by viewing a series of visual stimuli. These stimuli carried probabilistic information toward the choices. While the OCD patients achieved similar accuracy to the control, they took longer time and accumulated more evidence, especially in difficult trials in which the evidence strength was low. We further modeled the subjects' decision making as a leaky drifting diffusion process toward two collapsing bounds. The control group showed a higher drifting rate than the OCD group, indicating that the OCD group was less sensitive to evidence. Together, these results demonstrated that the OCD patients were less efficient than the control at transforming sensory information into evidence. However, their evidence accumulation was comparable to the healthy control, and they compensated for their decision-making accuracy with longer reaction times.", "Keywords": ["decision-making", "drift diffusion model", "evidence accumulation", "obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)", "probabilistic reasoning"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yilin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Primate Neurobiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianming", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Primate Neurobiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36203323", "Title": "Continuous theta burst stimulation over the bilateral supplementary motor area in obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment: A clinical randomized single-blind sham-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can cause substantial damage to quality of life.

In the current study, we retrieved multiple scRNA-seq datasets and illustrated the genetic programs of PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. Notably, the transcription levels of Id1 were elevated specifically along with the PDAC development. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that Id1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. The gene expression patterns of human PDAC cells were determined by the comparative analysis of the scRNA-seq data on human PDAC and normal pancreas tissues. ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells were dramatically increased compared to normal epithelial cells. ID1 deficiency in vitro significantly blunt the invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. IPA analysis on the differentially expressed genes suggested that EIF2 signaling was the core pathway regulating the development of PDAC. Blocking EFI2 signaling remarkably decreased the expression of ID1 and attenuated the tumor-formation related phenotypes. These observations confirmed that ID1 was regulated by EIF2 signaling and was the critical determinator of PDAC development and progression.

EuUCH is characterized by a high selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe3+ and Al3+, which yield different responsive modes. The two emissions of EuUCH are quenched by Fe3+; by contrast, only the emission at 450\u00a0nm is quenched by Al3+ showing a ratiometric fluorescence signal.

The estrogen receptor (ER) was considered a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC. Numerous studies have linked expression of ER\u03b2 to lung cancer outcome. However, results are conflicting regarding the association of ER\u03b2 with surviving lung cancer. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic aspect of ER\u03b2 expression on survival among NSCLC patients. We performed a final analysis of prognostic value of overexpression ER\u03b2 on 3500 patients from 18 evaluable studies (from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2021). The reference category is specified as low ER\u03b2 expression levels. Summarized hazard ratios were calculated. Our study showed that the pooled hazard ratios of ER\u03b2 overexpression for overall survival in NSCLC was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-1.02, P\u2009=\u20090.07) by univariate analysis and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.83-1.36, P\u2009=\u20090.63) by multivariate analysis. Pooled hazard ratio by univariate analysis in Asian studies was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.59-0.89, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Pooled hazard ratio by univariate analysis was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61-0.93, P\u2009=\u20090.009) from seven studies reported for nuclear ER\u03b2. No significant results were found in subgroups by multivariate analysis. No significant results were found in studies outside Asia or in studies reported for cytoplasmic ER\u03b2.

Hypotheses about OCD mainly include dysregulated neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, and disturbed neurodevelopment. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies regarding OCD are often met with inconsistent results. However, stratification by age of onset may sometimes help to limit the heterogenicity of OCD patients. Therefore, we conducted a stratified SNP association study enrolling 636 patients and 612 healthy controls. Patients were stratified by age of onset as early-onset (EO-OCD) and late-onset (LO-OCD). Blood extracted from the patients was used to genotype 18 loci, including serotonin system genes, Slitrk1, Slitrk5, and DMRT2 and related miRNA genes. Logistic regression was used to compare allele and genotype frequencies of variants. A general linear model was used to evaluate the association between variants and trait anxiety. In our study, rs3824419 in DMRT2 was associated with EO-OCD, G allele was the risk allele. Rs2222722 in miR-30a-5p was associated with EO-OCD, with the C allele being the risk allele. Rs1000952 in HTR3D was found associated with trait anxiety in OCD patients. The significance disappeared after FDR correction. Our results supported neurodevelopment-related genes, DMRT2 and miR-30a-5p, to be related to EO-OCD. However, we cannot prove serotonin genes to be directly associated with EO-OCD. While an association between HTR3D and trait anxiety was discovered, comparisons based on biological or clinical traits may be helpful in future studies.

However, a newly emerging Omicron variant, including BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 sublineages,\u00a0largely escaped the neutralization of existing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), even those elicited by three doses of vaccines. Here, we used the Omicron BA.1 RBD as a fourth dose of vaccine to induce potent Omicron-specific nAbs and evaluated the broadly neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The BA.1-based vaccine was indeed prone to induce a strain-specific antibody response substantially cross-reactive with BA.2 sublineage, and yet triggered broad neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants when it was used in the sequential immunization with WT and other variant vaccines.

However, TRAIL showed limited efficacy in clinical trials despite of good tolerability. One important reason might be attributed to the poor tumor-homing ability of TRAIL.

Z-TRAIL was produced as a soluble protein with high yield in E. coli and it maintained the trimeric state of active TRAIL. Under the EGFR-binding mediated by ZEGFR:1907, Z-TRAIL showed a\u00a0\u223c5 to 20-fold enhancement of cytotoxicity compared to TRAIL on tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, fusion to ZEGFR:1907 endowed TRAIL with a\u00a0\u223c1.8-fold increase of tumor uptake and a dramatical stronger apoptosis-inducing ability in the mice bearing EGFR-overexpressing A431 tumor xenografts.

Radioresistance is one of the most important challenges in the therapy of HCC compared with other local advanced, recurrent and metastatic cancers. The mechanisms of radioresistance are complex and remain to be fully understood; however, extracellular vesicles have been investigated in recent studies. Exosomes, which are 40\u2011\u00a0to\u00a0150\u2011nm extracellular vesicles released by cancer cells, contain multiple pathogenic components, including proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and play critical functions in cancer progression. Emerging data indicate a diagnosis potential for exosomes in HCC, since radiation\u2011derived exosomes promote radioresistance. Radiation\u2011based therapy alters the contents and components of exosomes, suggesting that exosomes and their components may serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to monitor radiation response. Therefore, understanding the roles and mechanisms of exosomes in HCC progression and radiation response during HCC therapy may increase our knowledge concerning the roles of exosomes in radioresistance, and may lead to novel approaches for HCC prognosis and treatment.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (Her3) is highly expressed in several solid tumors and is an ideal target for tumor diagnosis and therapy. This study prepared a Her3-specific dimeric affibody (ZHer3) using an Escherichia coli expression system. The affibody could bind explicitly to Her3-positive MCF7 and LS174T cells, rather than to Her3-negative SKOV-3 cells in vitro. ICG was coupled with the ZHer3 affibody (ICG-ZHer3) through an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester reactive group for tumor-targeted delivery. As expected, Her3-positive cells were selectively and efficiently killed by ICG-ZHer3-mediated PTT in vitro. In vivo, ICG-ZHer3 preferentially accumulated in Her3-positive LS174T tumor grafts because of the tumor-targeting ability of the ZHer3 affibody. As a result of the local generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and hyperthermia, the growth rates of LS174T tumor grafts were significantly inhibited by ICG-ZHer3-mediated PTT, and ICG-ZHer3 showed good safety performance during short-term treatment. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that ICG-ZHer3 is a promising photosensitizer for PTT against Her3-positive tumors.", "Keywords": ["Affibody", "Cancer-targeted therapy", "Her3", "ICG", "Photothermal therapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Indocyanine Green", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Photothermal Therapy", "Receptor, ErbB-3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huimin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dianlong", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Design, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Fengjiao", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Joint Laboratory for Translational Medicine Research, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng 252000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Feifei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Design, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Danfeng", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohui", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Baoqing", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shuhui", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Design, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ruohan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Design, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, PR China.

Lipophagy, a form of selective autophagy and a novel type of lipid metabolism, has recently received much attention. Lipophagy is defined as the autophagic degradation of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). Although much remains unknown, lipophagy appears to play a significant role in many organisms, cell types, metabolic states, and diseases. It participates in the regulation of intracellular lipid storage, intracellular free lipid levels (e.g., fatty acids), and energy balance. However, it remains unclear how intracellular lipids regulate autophagy. Impaired lipophagy can cause cells to become sensitive to death stimuli and may be responsible for the onset of a variety of diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome. Like autophagy, the role of lipophagy in cancer is poorly understood, although analysis of specific autophagy receptors has helped to expand the diversity of chemotherapeutic targets. These studies have stimulated increasing interest in the role of lipophagy in the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer and other human diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autophagy", "Fatty Acids", "Humans", "Lipid Droplets", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lysosomes", "Metabolic Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueqiang", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Shibo", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaxing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Guangpeng", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Hangyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110032, China. qingfan@cmu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2022Feb08"}, {"PMID": "35092599", "Title": "Pharmacist-Led Management Improves Treatment Adherence and Quality of Life in Opioid-Tolerant Patients With Cancer Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial.", "Abstract": "Opioid-tolerant patients are more likely to deviate from recommended treatments and to experience inadequate analgesia than opioid-naive ones.

Signaling via PD-1/PD-L1 will transmits negative regulatory signals to T cells, inducing T-cell inhibition, reducing CD8+ T-cell proliferation, or promoting T-cell apoptosis, which effectively reduces the immune response and leads to large-scale tumor growth. Accordingly, many antibody preparations targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been designed to block the binding of these two proteins and restore T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells. However, these drugs are ineffective in clinical practice. Recently, numerous of studies have shown that, in addition to the surface of tumor cells, PD-L1 is also found on the surface of extracellular vesicles secreted by these cells. Extracellular vesicle PD-L1 can also interact with PD-1 on the surface of T cells, leading to immunosuppression, and has been proposed as a potential mechanism underlying PD-1/PD-L1-targeted drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to explore the production, regulation and tumor immunosuppression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells and extracellular vesicles, as well as the potential clinical application of extracellular vesicle PD-L1 as tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

In this work, solid-phase extraction with mixed solid phases and adsorption sedimentation were used to successfully establish a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for detecting eight NAs in rat faeces. Chromatographic separation of analytes was performed with Agilent VF-WAXms (30\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.25\u00a0mm, 0.25\u00a0\u00b5m) GC columns. The LLOQs of eight NAs were set to the concentration of 0.5\u00a0ng/g and the obtained standard curves were linear, and correlation coefficients (r) were \u2265\u00a00.99 for samples with concentration ranges of 0.5-500\u00a0ng/g. The inter and intra-assay precisions were<\u00a015% for all analytes in the quality control samples, and the accuracies ranged from 88.67% to 108.33%. The extraction recoveries were above 78.56% for seven NAs, and a significant matrix effect was not observed. The application of this method revealed that the levels of NAS in the faeces of rats with colorectal cancer were higher than those of normal rats. Additionally, the effect of a high nitrite diet on NAs in faeces was analysed; the results confirmed that a high nitrite diet might contribute to an abnormal increase in NAs. Our work provides an analytical method for further in vivo study of NAs. Furthermore, a pilot study on the relationship between NAs and colorectal cancer was completed.", "Keywords": ["Colorectal cancer", "GC-MS", "Gut microbiota", "High nitrite diet", "NDMA", "Nitrosamines"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Feces", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry", "Nitrosamines", "Pilot Projects", "Rats", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhen Xiong", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital), Taizhou, Zhejiang 317700, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Sai Zhen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital), Taizhou, Zhejiang 317700, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhe Lin", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital), Taizhou, Zhejiang 317700, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Bin Xu", "Affiliation": "Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital), Taizhou, Zhejiang 317700, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Ling Ling", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital), Taizhou, Zhejiang 317700, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shan Ming", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong 250117, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong 250117, PR China.

Two modulators with opposite functional roles bind to overlapping sites within the transmembrane domain through common interactions, acting to stabilize distinct rotamer conformations of key residues on the TM6 helix.

However, the genetic reassortment of LPAIVs may generate novel viruses with increased virulence and cross-species transmission, posing potential risks to public health. To evaluate the epidemic potential and infection landscape of LPAIVs in Guangxi Province, China, we collected and analyzed throat and cloacal swab samples from chickens, ducks and geese from the live poultry markets on a regular basis from 2016 to 2019. Among the 7,567 samples, 974 (12.87%) were LPAIVs-positive, with 890 single and 84 mixed infections. Higher yearly isolation rates were observed in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, geese had the highest isolation rate, followed by ducks and chickens. Seasonally, spring had the highest isolation rate. Subtype H3, H4, H6 and H9 viruses were detected over prolonged periods, while H1 and H11 viruses were detected transiently. The predominant subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese were H9, H3, and H6, respectively. The 84 mixed infection samples contained 22 combinations.

Herein, step-by-step dual stimuli-responsive azithromycin-loaded nanoparticles (CM/AZM@Tyr) was constructed for efficient biofilm eradication. CM/AZM@Tyr was prepared by the self-assembly of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-polyethylene glycol-polyethylenimine (PCL-PEG-PEI) into cationic micelles and simultaneously encapsulated AZM into the hydrophobic core, which is further bound with cis-aconityl-D-tyrosine (CA-Tyr) through electrostatic interaction. Upon initial penetration, CM/AZM@Tyr could show step-by-step dual-response to the microenvironment of biofilms. Firstly, the CA-Tyr shell rapidly responded to the acidic microenvironment and released D-Tyr to disassemble the biofilm mass. Then, the exposed cationic CM/AZM micelles could bind firmly to the negatively-charged bacteria cell membrane. With the enzymolysis of the PCL core, the rapidly releasing AZM could kill the bacteria over the depth of biofilms. Massive accumulation was observed in the infected lungs of biofilms-associated lung infection mice after the i.v. injection of CM/Cy5.5@Tyr under the 3D mode of the in vivo Imaging System. Reduced bacterial burden and alleviated fibrosis in the infected lungs were also obtained after treatment with CM/AZM@Tyr mainly due to its intensive penetration in the biofilm and the orderly release of the biofilm dispersant and antimicrobial agents.

During entry, gB fuses viral and host cell membranes by refolding from a prefusion to a postfusion form. We previously introduced three structure-based mutations (gB-I671A/H681A/F683A) into the domain V arm of the gB ectodomain that resulted in reduced cell-cell fusion. A virus carrying these three mutations (called gB3A) displayed a small-plaque phenotype and remarkably delayed entry into cells. To identify mutations that could counteract this phenotype, we serially passaged the gB3A virus and selected for revertant viruses with increased plaque sizes. Genomic sequencing revealed that the revertant viruses had second-site mutations in gB, including E187A, M742T, and S383F/G645R/V705I/V880G. Using expression constructs encoding these mutations, only gB-V880G was shown to enhance cell-cell fusion. In contrast, all of the revertant viruses showed enhanced entry kinetics, underscoring the fact that cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion are different. The results indicate that mutations in three different regions of gB (domain I, the membrane proximal region, and the cytoplasmic tail domain) can counteract the slow-entry phenotype of gB3A virus. Mapping these compensatory mutations to prefusion and postfusion structural models suggests sites of intramolecular functional interactions with the gB domain V arm that may contribute to the gB fusion function. IMPORTANCE The nine human herpesviruses are ubiquitous and cause a range of diseases in humans. Glycoprotein B (gB) is an essential viral fusion protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses. During host cell entry, gB mediates virus-cell membrane fusion by undergoing a conformational change. Structural models for the prefusion and postfusion forms of gB exist, but the details of how the protein converts from one to the other are unclear. We previously introduced structure-based mutations into gB that inhibited virus entry and fusion. By passaging this entry-deficient virus over time, we selected second-site mutations that partially restore virus entry. The locations of these mutations suggest regulatory sites that contribute to fusion and gB refolding during entry. gB is a target of neutralizing antibodies, and defining how gB refolds during entry could provide a basis for the development of fusion inhibitors for future research or clinical use.", "Keywords": ["entry", "fusion", "glycoprotein gB", "glycoproteins", "herpes simplex virus 1", "revertant"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cricetulus", "Herpes Simplex", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Membrane Fusion", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Conformation", "Vero Cells", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern Universitygrid.16753.36, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Longnecker", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern Universitygrid.16753.36, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, DePaul Universitygrid.254920.8, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2021Oct27"}, {"PMID": "34413795", "Title": "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Unmedicated Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial With 6-Month Follow-Up.", "Abstract": "Background: This was the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder with that of the first-line treatment for OCD (SSRIs) or a placebo, as well as to analyze the treatment acceptability and safety of MBCT. Methods: A total of 123 unmedicated OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms were randomly assigned into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors group (SSRIs group), MBCT group or psycho-education group (PE group), respectively. They were intervened for 10 weeks. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) grade was the primary outcome, and Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) grades were secondary outcomes to be measured at baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention and 14, 22, and 34 weeks of follow-up. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were used to assess mindfulness and social functions, respectively.

The existence of VES component in the structure of DOX-loaded micelles had no obvious influence on the subcellular distribution of the encapsulated DOX molecules. Furthermore, the DOX-loaded VDPM2 exhibited more pronounced cytotoxicity to 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cancerous cells compared with DOX-loaded DPM and free DOX solution. The hybrid nanocarriers including VES and DSPE-PEG selectively induced intracellular ROS accumulation and increased level of cytoplasmic calcium ion in cancerous cells by interacting with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, bringing about the improved cytotoxicity of DOX.

For the experiment to be carried out, we obtained materials, and the procedures were carried out in the following manner. The initial step was the preparation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, followed by precipitation to acquire Apatite colloidal suspensions. Animals were obtained, and their tissue isolation and grouping were done ethically.

Hemocompatibility was quantified using Terminal Complement Complex (TCC) and Neutrophil elastase (NE) as an indicator. The results of the H&E staining revealed less formation of extracellular ice crystals and intracellular vacuoles in the IFC + T group compared with all other groups.

The pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs were prepared by ion crosslinking method, and their physicochemical properties were investigated. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)(MCF-7, MCF-7/ADR, K562 and K562/ADR) and drug-resistant related protein P-gp. MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR were selected as cell models. The cytotoxicity of pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs, the multiple of cell resistance to adriamycin, the reversal resistance index of pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs to doxorubicin and the sensitization of pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs to doxorubicin were detected by MTT assay. After MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR were treated with pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs, the expression changes of P-gp were detected by Western blot. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs were 37.66%\u00b1 0.53% and 3.25%\u00b1 0.34% respectively in HPLC. The nanoparticles showed an average particle size of(150.50\u00b19.3) nm, polymer dispersity index of(0.059\u00b10.007) and Zeta potential of(19.30\u00b12.02) mV as detected by laser particle size analyzer. The nanoparticles were spherical and well dispersed under transmission electron microscope. Western blot results showed that EGFR was positively expressed in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells, while negatively expressed in K562 and K562/ADR cells. P-gp was highly expressed in MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR, while negatively expressed in MCF-7 and K562. pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs had a weak effect on MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR. The adriamycin resistance of MCF-7/ADR cells was 108.36 times, and that of K562/ADR cells was more than 100 times. When IC_(85) of pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs was used as the administration concentration, the reversion index of MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR cells was 3.68 and 1.87, respectively. pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs could enhance the sensitivity of adriamycin to MCF-7/ADR cells in a positive correlation with the concentration, and the sensitivity was significantly higher than that of K562/ADR cells. Western blot results showed that the expression level of P-gp in MCF-7/ADR cells decreased significantly after treatment with pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs, while the expression level of P-gp in K562/ADR cells did not change significantly. Experimental results show that pEGF-CS-TMP-NPs have an active targeting effect on MCF-7/ADR cells with high EGFR expression, and can effectively reverse the multidrug resistance of MCF-7/ADR cells. Active targeting effect is related to the peptides modification of nanoparticles, and the mechanism of reversing tumor MDR may be achieved by down-regulating the expression level of P-gp.", "Keywords": ["epidermal growth factor receptor", "nanoparticles", "reverse multidrug resistance", "tetramethylprazine", "tumor cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Chitosan", "Doxorubicin", "Drug Resistance, Multiple", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Nanoparticles", "Peptides", "Pyrazines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liu", "Last Name": "Xiang-Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Qing", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhao", "Last Name": "Chen-Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Shao", "Last Name": "Ming-Kun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "M A", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Li-Chun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "A", "Last Name": "Ren Bao Li Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University Dalian 116027, China."}, {"First Name": "Y U", "Last Name": "Zhen-Long", "Affiliation": "Dalian Medical University Dalian 116044, China."}], "Journal": "Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica", "PubDate": "2020Nov"}, {"PMID": "33289538", "Title": "Construction of a Mesoporous Polydopamine@GO/Cellulose Nanofibril Composite Hydrogel with an Encapsulation Structure for Controllable Drug Release and Toxicity Shielding.", "Abstract": "The development of intelligent and multifunctional hydrogels having photothermal properties, good mechanical properties, sustained drug release abilities with low burst release, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility is highly desirable in the biomaterial field. Herein, mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) nanoparticles wrapped with graphene oxide (GO) were physically cross-linked in cellulose nanofibril (CNF) hydrogel to obtain a novel MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel for controllable drug release. MPDA nanoparticles exhibited a high drug loading ratio (up to 35 wt %) for tetracycline hydrochloride (TH). GO was used to encapsulate MPDA nanoparticles for extending the drug release time and reinforcing the physical strength of the obtained hydrogel. The mechanical strength of the as-fabricated MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel was five times greater compared to that of the pure CNF hydrogel. Drug release experiments demonstrated that burst release behavior was significantly reduced by adding MPDA@GO. The drug release time of the MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel was 3 times and 7.2 times longer than that of the polydopamine/CNF hydrogel and pure CNF hydrogel, respectively. The sustained and controlled drug release behaviors of the composite hydrogel were highly dependent on the proportion of MPDA and GO. Moreover, the rate of drug release could be accelerated by near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation and pH value change. The drug release kinetics of the as-prepared composite hydrogel was well described by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, and the drug release mechanism of TH from the composite hydrogel was anomalous transport. Importantly, this carefully designed MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel showed good biocompatibility through an in vitro cytotoxicity test. In particular, the toxicity of GO was well shielded by the CNF hydrogel.

Among them, Gallus NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (NME2) was further validated as a \u03c3A-binding protein through co-immunoprecipitation. The key interaction domain was identified at amino acids (aa) 121-416 in NME2 and at aa 71-139 in \u03c3A, respectively. We demonstrated that overexpression of NME2 substantially inhibited ARV replication. In addition silencing NME2 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in marked enhancement of ARV replication. Our work has demonstrated that NME2 is a \u03c3A-binding protein that may affect ARV replication in CEF cells.", "Keywords": ["Avian reovirus", "NME2 protein", "Protein-protein interactions", "\u03c3A protein"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chick Embryo", "Fibroblasts", "NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases", "Oncogene Protein v-akt", "Orthoreovirus, Avian", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "RNA, Small Interfering", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Viral Core Proteins", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liji", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, 530001, China.

In this study, a large-scale surveillance of parvoviruses in chickens and turkeys using conserved PCR assays was performed. We assessed the prevalence of ChPV/TuPV in commercial chicken and turkey farms in China between 2014 and 2019. Parvoviruses were prevalent in 51.73% (1,795/3,470) of commercial chicken and turkey farms in Guangxi, China. The highest frequency of ChPV positive samples tested by PCR occurred in chickens that were broiler chickens 64.18% (1,041/1,622) compared with breeder chickens 38.75% (572/1,476) and layer hens 38.89% (112/288), and TuPV was detected in 70/84 (83.33%). Native and exotic chicken species were both prevalent in commercial farms in southern China, and exotic broiler chickens had a higher positive rate with 88.10% (148/168), while native chickens were 50.00% (1,465/2,930). The environmental samples from poultry houses tested positive for ChPV and TuPV were 47.05% (415/874). Samples from open house flocks had higher prevalence rates of ChPV than those of closed house flocks (Table 5), among which those from the open house showed 84.16% (85/101) positivity, those from litter showed 62.86% (44/70) positivity, and those from drinking water showed 50.00% (56/112) positivity, whereas those from the closed house litter were 53.57% (60/112), those from swabs were 50.18% (138/275), and those from drinking water were 15.69% (32/204). Samples collected during spring were more frequently ChPV/ TuPV positive than those collected during other seasons. This study is the first report regarding the epidemiological surveillance of ChPV and TuPV in chicken/turkey flocks in Guangxi, China.

We found that the level of 14, 15-EET was higher in peripheral blood of children with KD compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). In comparison to KD children with non-coronary artery lesion (nCAL), the level of 14, 15-EET was higher in peripheral blood of KD children with coronary artery lesion (CAL) (P < 0.05). Compared with healthy control group, the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MMP-9 in patients with KD were significantly up-regulated. Compared with nCAL KD children, the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MMP-9 in CAL children were abnormally high (P < 0.05). Our study indicated that AUDA played an anti-inflammatory effect in HCAECs through PPAR\u03b3/STAT1 signaling pathway, and 14, 15-EET is up-regulated in children with KD, suggesting that 14, 15-EET involved in the progression of KD.", "Keywords": ["14", "15-EET", "AUDA", "Kawasaki disease", "PPAR\u03b3", "coronary injury"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunyan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Minmin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyue", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Haizhao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Cuifen", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32867960", "Title": "Genetic characterization of fowl aviadenovirus 4 isolates from Guangxi, China, during 2017-2019.", "Abstract": "Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) is a severe disease that causes 20 to 80% mortality in chickens aged 3 to 6\u00a0wk. Fowl aviadenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) plays an important role in the etiology of HHS. Since 2015, outbreaks of HHS have been reported in several provinces of China; however, details regarding the FAdV-4 genome properties are lacking. In the present study, the complete genomes of 9 isolates responsible for these outbreaks in Guangxi Province, China, were sequenced. To investigate the molecular characteristics of these FAdV-4 isolates, we compared their genomes with those of other reported pathogenic and nonpathogenic FAdV-4 isolates. A variable number of GA repeats were observed in the isolates of this study. Each of the isolates GX2017-01, GX2017-02, GX2018-08, and GX2019-09 had 11\u00a0GA repeats; GX2017-03, GX2017-04, and GX2017-05 each had 10\u00a0GA repeats, while GX2017-06 and GX2018-07 each had 8\u00a0GA repeats. We observed several deletions and distinct amino acid mutations in the major structural genes of these isolates when compared with non-Chinese isolates. We found 2 novel putative genetic markers in the hexon protein, one present in GX2017-02, in which aspartic acid (D) was changed to tyrosine (Y), and another present in each of isolates GX2018-08 and GX2019-09, in which serine (S) was changed to arginine (R), when compared with selected Chinese and some non-Chinese isolates. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the isolates of this study were clustered within FAdV-C. We found that these isolates were closely related to other recently isolated Chinese strains. The data presented in this study will not only increase the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of FAdV-4 isolates in China but also has an important reference value of the major factors that determine the virulence of FAdV-4 strains.", "Keywords": ["amino acid change", "fowl adenovirus 4", "genetic characterization", "outbreak"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aviadenovirus", "Chickens", "China", "Genetic Variation", "Genome, Viral", "Mutation", "Phylogeny"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Farooq", "Last Name": "Rashid", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China; Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhixun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China; Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Nanning, China.

A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2-6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9-14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

In vivo, AS-Dox confirmed its long circulation time and efficient accumulation in tumors. This targeted chemotherapy achieved greater tumor suppression. Further, this low-dose but effective targeted treatment reduced systemic toxicity such as body weight loss and organ injury demonstrated by H&E staining.

However, dislocation of intraperitoneal portion of drainage tube and poor drainage after major surgery has never been detailed. In this retrospective study, we determined whether postoperative abdominal infectious complications are attributed to dislocation of intraperitoneal portion of drainage tube. Patients were recruited from the Department of General Surgery at Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, between June 2015 and June 2018. All of the enrolled patients had undergone different major abdominal surgical procedures with abdominal drainage. According to different fixation methods of the drainage tube, the patients were categorised as follows: group 1 as conventional extra-abdominal fixation where the tubes were fixed on abdominal wall; group 2 as double fixation where the tubes were fixed by both extra-abdominal and intra-abdominal fixation. Among 60 patients (40 in group 1 and 20 in group 2) with suspected postoperative abdominal infection, abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed to determine the presence of abnormality. Dislocation of drainage tubes, morbidity, treatment, and prognosis were compared between the two groups. None of the patients showed slip knot or drainage tube slipping from the abdomen based on physical examination and CT imaging. Drainage tube was fixed firmly on the abdominal wall. In group 1, 18 (45%) patients developed postoperative complications resulting from abdominal infection where severe dislocation of intraperitoneal portion of drainage tubes was confirmed by CT. Drainage tubes of six cases were significantly dislocated to the anterior abdominal wall from the target area; 7 upper abdominal drainage tubes dislocated to the lower abdomen; and 5 lower abdominal drainage tubes dislocated to the upper abdomen. Common complications included localised peritonitis (n = 4), abdominal abscess (n = 8), and anastomotic leakage (n = 6). Among them, 8 patients were cured by abdominal puncture catheter drainage; 5 underwent secondary operation and 5 were cured by conservative treatment. In group 2, no tube dislocation was identified by CT. Five patients (25%) developed complications, including localised peritonitis (n = 1), abdominal abscess (n = 1), and anastomotic leakage (n = 3). All the five patients were cured by conservative treatment. Postoperative abdominal infection complications can stem from dislocation of intraperitoneal portion of drainage tube and poor drainage after major abdominal surgery. Maintaining the intraperitoneal portion of drainage tube at the proper location, for example, by applying intraabdominal fixation, is paramount to decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative complications.", "Keywords": ["abdominal surgery", "dislocation of intraperitoneal portion of drainage tube", "postoperative abdominal infection"], "MeSH terms": ["Abdomen", "Abdominal Cavity", "Drainage", "Humans", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yifan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guangzhong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongbo", "Last Name": "Lian", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziliang", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Siqi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenping", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth School of Clinical Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Buhe", "Last Name": "Amin", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Nengwei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jirun", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"First Name": "Bao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology Surgery, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University/Peking University, Ninth Clinical Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "International wound journal", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "32357718", "Title": "High-numerical-aperture and long-working-distance objective for single-atom experiments.", "Abstract": "We present a long-working-distance objective lens with numerical apertures NA = 0.4 for single-atom experiments.

Rapid and effective methods for differentiating these nine NA subtypes are needed. We developed and validated a rapid, sensitive, and robust method utilizing a GeXP analyzer-based multiplex RT-PCR assay and capillary electrophoresis for the simultaneous differentiation of the N1 to N9 subtypes in a single-tube reaction. Ten pairs of primers-nine subtype-specific pairs and one pan-AIV pair-were screened and used to establish the GeXP multiplex RT-PCR assay. A single subtype was detected using the developed GeXP assay; the N1 to N9 AIV subtypes individually generated two target peaks: the NA subtype-specific peak and the general AIV peak. Different concentrations of multiplexed subtypes were tested with this GeXP assay and the peaks of the corresponding NA subtypes were generated, suggesting that this GeXP assay is useful for identifying NA subtypes in mixed samples. Moreover, no peaks were generated for other important avian viruses, indicating negative results and validating the lack of cross-reactions between AIV subtypes and other avian pathogens. RNA templates synthesized through in vitro transcription were used to analyze the sensitivity of the assay; the limit of detection was 100 copies per reaction mixture. The results obtained from clinical samples using this GeXP method were consistent with the results of the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) test, and the ability of the GeXP assay to identify mixed infections was superior to amplicon sequencing of isolated viruses. In conclusion, this GeXP assay is proposed as a specific, sensitive, rapid, high-throughput, and versatile diagnostic tool for nine NA subtypes of AIV.", "Keywords": ["GeXP analyzer", "avian influenza virus", "differentiation diagnosis", "multiplex PCR", "neuraminidase"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sisi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhixun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaoling", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Liji", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Minxiu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanfang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}, {"First Name": "Xianwen", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, Nanning, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31213771", "Title": "Use of lidocaine to prevent postoperative coughing after partial laryngectomy: comparison of three delivery methods.", "Abstract": "Objective: To compare the effectiveness of lidocaine administration (intravenous injection, dripping via the tracheostomy tube, and spraying into the tracheostomy incision) on postoperative coughing after partial laryngectomy. Patients and methods: A total of 115 male patients with laryngeal carcinoma scheduled for partial laryngectomy under general anesthesia were randomized into three groups. In group I (n=35), 2% lidocaine hydrochloride (1.5\u00a0mg/kg) was slowly infused intravenously.

KCTDs interact with GABAB receptors and modify the kinetics of GABAB receptor signaling. Little is known about the molecular mechanism governing the direct association and functional coupling of GABAB receptors with these auxiliary proteins. Here, we describe the high-resolution structure of the KCTD16 oligomerization domain in complex with part of the GABAB2 receptor. A single GABAB2 C-terminal peptide is bound to the interior of an open pentamer formed by the oligomerization domain of five KCTD16 subunits. Mutation of specific amino acids identified in the structure of the GABAB2-KCTD16 interface disrupted both the biochemical association and functional modulation of GABAB receptors and G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) channels. These interfacial residues are conserved among KCTDs, suggesting a common mode of KCTD interaction with GABAB receptors.

The current strategies for vessel normalization focus on direct modulation of endothelial cells (ECs), which frequently affect vessels in normal tissues. Modulating EC-supporting cells, such as pericytes (PCs), is a new direction. Here, we produced a fusion protein, Z-TNF\u03b1, by fusing the platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)- antagonistic affibody ZPDGFR\u03b2 to tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Owing to the affinity of fused ZPDGFR\u03b2 for PDGFR\u03b2, Z-TNF\u03b1 binds PDGFR\u03b2+ PCs but not PDGFR\u03b2- ECs. Low-dose (1\u202f\u03bcg/mouse) Z-TNF\u03b1 treatment remodeled the tumor vessels, thus reducing vessel permeability and increasing vessel perfusion. As a result, the Z-TNF\u03b1 treatment improved the delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and enhanced its antitumor effect, indicating that Z-TNF\u03b1 induced normalization of tumor vessels. Mechanically, the tumor vessel normalization mediated by Z-TNF\u03b1 might be attributed to the reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by PCs and the elevated expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in PCs, which might suppress the proliferation and migration of ECs and simultaneously trigger interaction between perivascular macrophages and PCs. These results demonstrated that tumor-associated PCs could be considered novel target cells for vessel normalization, and Z-TNF\u03b1 might be developed as a potential tool for antitumor combination therapy.", "Keywords": ["Affibody", "Cancer-targeted therapy", "Pericytes", "Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1", "Vessel normalization"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biological Transport", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques", "Doxorubicin", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Liberation", "Endothelial Cells", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred ICR", "Neoplasms, Experimental", "Pericytes", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Ze", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiuxiao", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ultrasound, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Dianlong", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingqiu", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.

There is, however, little evidence that the RMTg-ventral tegmental area (VTA)-nucleus accumbens shell (Acb) circuit plays a role in the aversive consequences of alcohol withdrawal. This study was performed in adult male Long-Evans rats at 48-h withdrawal from chronic alcohol drinking in the intermittent schedule. These rats displayed clear anhedonia and depression-like behaviors, as measured with the sucrose preference, and forced swimming tests. These aberrant behaviors were accompanied by a substantial increase in cFos expression in the VTA-projecting RMTg neurons, identified by a combination of immunohistochemistry and retrograde-tracing techniques. Pharmacological or chemogenetic inhibition of RMTg neurons mitigated the anhedonia and depression-like behaviors. Ex vivo electrophysiological data showed that chemogenetic inactivation of RMTg neurons reduced GABA release and accelerated spontaneous firings of VTA dopamine neurons. Finally, using a functional hemispheric disconnection procedure, we demonstrated that inhibition of unilateral RMTg, when combined with activation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the contralateral (but not ipsilateral) Acb, mitigated the anhedonia and depression-like behaviors in alcohol-withdrawal rats. These data show that the integrity in the RMTg-VTA-Acb pathway in a single hemisphere is sufficient to elicit depression-like behavior during ethanol-withdrawal. Overall, the present results reveal that the RMTg-VTA-Acb pathway plays a crucial role in the depression-like behavior in animals undergoing alcohol withdrawal, further advocating the RMTg as a potential therapeutic target for alcoholism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine", "2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Clozapine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Ethanol", "Male", "Microinjections", "Neural Inhibition", "Neural Pathways", "Nucleus Accumbens", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos", "Quinoxalines", "Quinpirole", "Rats", "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome", "Tegmentum Mesencephali", "Ventral Tegmental Area", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rao", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanhong", "Last Name": "Zuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nimisha", "Last Name": "Shiwalkar", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qinghua", "Last Name": "Mei", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Bekker", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiang-Hong", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, NJ, 07103, USA. ye@njms.rutgers.edu."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2019Jul"}, {"PMID": "30883838", "Title": "The classification of eating disorders in China: A categorical model or a dimensional model.", "Abstract": "According to the ICD-10 and DSM-5, eating disorders (EDs) are classified using a categorical model that assumes the subtypes are qualitatively different from one another.

However, these disorders cannot always be well distinguished on clinical grounds and may also be comorbid. A biological blood-based dynamic genomic signature that can differentiate among OCD, MDD, and schizophrenia would therefore be of great utility. This study enrolled 77 patients with OCD, 67 controls with no psychiatric illness, 39 patients with MDD, and 40 with schizophrenia. An OCD-specific gene signature was identified using blood gene expression analysis to construct a predictive model of OCD that can differentiate this disorder from healthy controls, MDD, and schizophrenia using a logistic regression algorithm. To verify that the genes selected were not derived as a result of chance, the algorithm was tested twice. First, the algorithm was used to predict the cohort with true disease/control status and second, the algorithm predicted the cohort with disease/control status randomly reassigned (null set). A six-gene panel (COPS7A, FKBP1A, FIBP, TP73-AS1, SDF4, and GOLGA8A) discriminated patients with OCD from healthy controls, MDD, and schizophrenia in the training set (with an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.938; accuracy, 86%; sensitivity, 88%; and specificity, 85%).

To mediate fusion with the cellular membrane, gB refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation. We hypothesize that an interaction between the C-terminal arm and the central coiled coil of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gB ectodomain is critical for fusion. We previously reported that three mutations in the C-terminal arm (I671A/H681A/F683A, called gB3A) greatly reduced cell-cell fusion and that virus carrying these mutations had a small-plaque phenotype and delayed entry into cells. By serially passaging gB3A virus, we selected three revertant viruses with larger plaques. These revertant viruses acquired mutations in gB that restore the fusion function of gB3A, including gB-A683V, gB-S383F/G645R/V705I/A855V, and gB-T509M/N709H. V705I and N709H are novel mutations that map to the portion of domain V that enters domain I in the postfusion structure. S383F, G645R, and T509M are novel mutations that map to an intersection of three domains in a prefusion model of gB. We introduced these second-site mutations individually and in combination into wild-type gB and gB3A to examine the impact of the mutations on fusion and expression. V705I and A855V (a known hyperfusogenic mutation) restored the fusion function of gB3A, whereas S383F and G645R dampened fusion and T509M and N709H worked in concert to restore gB3A fusion. The results identify two regions in the gB ectodomain that modulate the fusion activity of gB, potentially by impacting intramolecular interactions and stability of the prefusion and/or postfusion gB trimer.IMPORTANCE Glycoprotein B (gB) is an essential viral protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and is required for virus entry. gB is thought to undergo a conformational change that provides the energy to fuse the viral and cellular membranes; however, the details of this conformational change and the structure of the prefusion and intermediate conformations of gB are not known. Previously, we demonstrated that mutations in the gB \"arm\" region inhibit fusion and impart a small-plaque phenotype. Using serial passage of a virus carrying these mutations, we identified revertants with restored plaque size. The revertant viruses acquired novel mutations in gB that restored fusion function and mapped to two sites in the gB ectodomain. This work supports our hypothesis that an interaction between the gB arm and the core of gB is critical for gB refolding and provides details about the function of gB in herpesvirus-mediated fusion and subsequent virus entry.", "Keywords": ["entry", "fusion", "gB", "glycoprotein B", "herpes simplex virus 1", "mutation", "revertant"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Refolding", "Selection, Genetic", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Viral Fusion Proteins", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah J", "Last Name": "Kopp", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina C", "Last Name": "Byskosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Longnecker", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA r-longnecker@northwestern.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2018Oct16"}, {"PMID": "30165867", "Title": "Clinical experience of debridement combined with resorbable bone graft substitute mixed with antibiotic in the treatment for infants with osteomyelitis.", "Abstract": "Osteomyelitis (OM) is an uncommon disease that originates from many different mechanisms in children.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a duplex fluorescence-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (DLAMP) assay for simultaneous detection of MB and BHV-1. Two sets of specific primers for each pathogen were designed to target the unique sequences of the MB uvrC gene and the BHV-1 gB gene. The inner primer for BHV-1 was synthesized with the fluorophore FAM at the 5' end to detect the BHV-1 gB gene, and the inner primer for MB was synthesized with the fluorophore CY5 at the 5' end to detect the MB uvrC gene. The DLAMP reaction conditions were optimized for rapid and specific detection of MB and BHV-1. The DLAMP assay developed here could specifically detect MB and BHV-1 without cross-reaction with other known non-target bovine pathogens. The sensitivity of this DLAMP assay was as low as 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 copies for recombinant plasmids containing the MB and BHV-1 target genes. In a detection test of 125 clinical samples, the positive rates for MB, BHV-1 and co-infection were 44.8%, 13.6% and 1.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of DLAMP were determined as 95%-96.6% and 100%, respectively, of those of field sample detection by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health.

Twelve months after surgery, patients from the 2 groups were also observed with reduction in BMI, percent excess weight loss (EWL), preoperative FPG, and HbA1c as compared with these indicators before surgery. However, the differences of these indicators between 2 groups were not significant at the time point of before and 3, 6, 12 months after surgery.LRYGB had significant effects on weight loss and diabetes control in obese T2DM patients. However, there was no significant difference in the short term on weight loss and diabetes control in the patients receiving different limb lengths.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anastomosis, Roux-en-Y", "Biliopancreatic Diversion", "Body Mass Index", "China", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Postoperative Period", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Weight Loss", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Peng", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dong-Bo", "Last Name": "Lian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dong-Dong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guang-Zhong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "De-Xiao", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Buhe", "Last Name": "Amin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ji-Run", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neng-Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Medicine", "PubDate": "2018Jun"}, {"PMID": "29807209", "Title": "Anterior thalamic radiation structural and metabolic changes in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A combined DTI-MRS study.", "Abstract": "Numerous studies indicate the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit plays an important role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), as a major fiber in the fronto-thalamic circuitry, contributes to symptomology of OCD. However, the underlying biochemical mechanism in relation with its structural alteration remains not understood. This study investigated the structural abnormality of ATR and its correlation with thalamic metabolic alteration in OCD, using diffusion tensor image (DTI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Twenty-six unmedicated adult OCD patients and twenty-six matched healthy controls participated in DTI study. Thirteen OCD patients and thirteen healthy controls, a subset of DTI participants, took part in MRS study. The results showed that mean fiber length of right ATR negatively correlated with ipsilateral thalamic choline (Cho) level in OCD patients. Additionally, significantly higher Cho concentration was detected in right thalamus of OCD patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value of right ATR positively correlated with patients Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score, as well as YBOCS compulsion score. These results suggested the coupling of structural and metabolic changes in right ATR, which might serve as a multi-modal biomarker contributing to the pathogenesis of OCD.", "Keywords": ["Anterior thalamic radiation", "Choline", "Diffusion tensor image", "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anisotropy", "Choline", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Thalamus", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruilin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Imaging Technology, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200030,China.

Conventional vascular-targeted PDT has been achieved by passive photosensitizer (PS) delivery, which involves a high risk of adverse effects. Active PS delivery is urgently required for vascular-targeted PDT. Although endothelial cells and pericytes are major cellular components of tumor blood vessels, little attention has been paid to pericyte-targeted PDT for cancer therapy. PDGFR\u03b2 is abundantly expressed in the pericytes of various tumors. In this experiment, a dimeric ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody with a 0.9\u2009nM affinity for PDGFR\u03b2 was produced. The ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody showed PDGFR\u03b2-dependent pericyte binding. Intravenously injected ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody was predominantly distributed on pericytes and thus accumulated in LS174T tumor grafts. The conjugate of the ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody and IR700 dye, i.e. ZIR700, bound to PDGFR\u03b2+ pericytes but not to PDGFR\u03b2- LS174T tumor cells. Accordingly, ZIR700-mediated PDT in vitro induced the death of pericytes but not of LS174T tumor cells. In mice bearing LS174T tumor grafts, ZIR700-mediated PDT damaged tumor blood vessels, thus inducing tumor destruction by intensifying tissue hypoxia. The average mass of tumor grafts administered with ZIR700-mediated PDT was approximately 20-30% of that of the control, indicating that pericyte-targeted PDT is efficient for cancer therapy.

Long neglected in research, exosomes were deemed nonfunctional cellular components to be discarded. However, it has been gradually revealed that exosomes are an important tool for the exchange of intercellular information and material. Exosomes contain specific repertoires of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs, including microRNA and lncRNA), indicating that a specific RNA sorting mechanism may exist. Correspondingly, intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are produced after fusion with the cell membrane to release exosomes rather than inducing autophagy, which reveals that there may be a specific regulatory mechanism for MVB secretion. Cells can trigger cancer-related disorders after the recognition and uptake of circulating exosomal ncRNAs, providing indications for early tumor biopsy and treatment. The use of exosomes as a biological carrier in targeted therapy has been demonstrated. However, there may be a specific, unknown switch for loading drugs. This review focuses on the mechanisms of exosome biogenesis, release, and uptake.

PCC 7120.", "Abstract": "Filamentous cyanobacteria have developed a strategy to perform incompatible processes in one filament by differentiating specialized cell types, N2-fixing heterocysts and CO2-fixing, photosynthetic, vegetative cells. These bacteria can be considered true multicellular organisms with cells exchanging metabolites and signaling molecules via septal junctions, involving the SepJ and FraCD proteins. Previously, it was shown that the cell wall lytic N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase, AmiC2, is essential for cell-cell communication in Nostoc punctiforme. This enzyme perforates the septal peptidoglycan creating an array of nanopores, which may be the framework for septal junction complexes. In Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, two homologs of AmiC2, encoded by amiC1 and amiC2, were identified and investigated in two different studies. Here, we compare the function of both AmiC proteins by characterizing different Anabaena amiC mutants, which was not possible in N. punctiforme, because there the amiC1 gene could not be inactivated. This study shows the different impact of each protein on nanopore array formation, the process of cell-cell communication, septal protein localization, and heterocyst differentiation. Inactivation of either amidase resulted in significant reduction in nanopore count and in the rate of fluorescent tracer exchange between neighboring cells measured by FRAP analysis. In an amiC1 amiC2 double mutant, filament morphology was affected and heterocyst differentiation was abolished. Furthermore, the inactivation of amiC1 influenced SepJ localization and prevented the filament-fragmentation phenotype that is characteristic of sepJ or fraC fraD mutants. Our findings suggest that both amidases are to some extent redundant in their function, and describe a functional relationship of AmiC1 and septal proteins SepJ and FraCD.", "Keywords": ["AmiC", "SepJ", "amidase", "cell\u2013cell communication", "cyanobacteria", "heterocysts", "peptidoglycan", "septal junctions"], "MeSH terms": ["Amidohydrolases", "Anabaena", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Communication", "Cell Wall", "Cytoskeleton", "Intercellular Junctions", "Membrane Proteins", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Mutation", "Nanopores", "Peptidoglycan"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Bornikoel", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine T\u00fcbingen, Organismic Interactions, University of T\u00fcbingenT\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Carri\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica Vegetal y Fotos\u00edntesis, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas and Universidad de SevillaSeville, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern UniversityChicago, IL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Enrique", "Last Name": "Flores", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica Vegetal y Fotos\u00edntesis, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas and Universidad de SevillaSeville, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Karl", "Last Name": "Forchhammer", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine T\u00fcbingen, Organismic Interactions, University of T\u00fcbingenT\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Vicente", "Last Name": "Mariscal", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica Vegetal y Fotos\u00edntesis, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas and Universidad de SevillaSeville, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Conrad W", "Last Name": "Mullineaux", "Affiliation": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of LondonLondon, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Rebeca", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine T\u00fcbingen, Organismic Interactions, University of T\u00fcbingenT\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nadine", "Last Name": "Silber", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine T\u00fcbingen, Organismic Interactions, University of T\u00fcbingenT\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "C Peter", "Last Name": "Wolk", "Affiliation": "MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State UniversityEast Lansing, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Iris", "Last Name": "Maldener", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine T\u00fcbingen, Organismic Interactions, University of T\u00fcbingenT\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28860228", "Title": "Anterior transversalis fascia approach versus preperitoneal space approach for inguinal hernia repair in residents in northern China: study protocol for a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Many surgical techniques have been used to repair abdominal wall defects in the inguinal region based on the anatomic characteristics of this region and can be categorised as 'tension' repair or 'tension-free' repair.

The CobraPLA provided an oropharyngeal leak pressure higher than that provided by the CLMA (weight mean difference: 3.90, 95% CI, [1.59-6.21] cmH2O) and ULMA (weight mean difference: 6.57, 95% CI, [4.30-8.84] cmH2O). We also found a higher likelihood of blood staining in the airway with the CobraPLA than with the CLMA. In our research, the principal finding of our meta-analysis is that the success rate of first insertion of the CobraPLA was not different from the rate for each of the CLMA and the ULMA, which featured a short learning curve implying its ease of insertion. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of the best view (with a score of 4) obtained with the CobraPLA compared with the other 2 devices. The CobraPLA does seem to be superior to the CLMA and ULMA in providing a higher oropharyngeal leak pressure. The data were insufficient to establish differences in airway adverse events between the groups except for blood staining in the devices, although mucosal trauma occurred more frequently with the Cobra PLA device than with the CLMA and the ULMA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anesthesia, General", "Humans", "Intubation, Intratracheal", "Laryngeal Masks", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "From the *Department of Anesthesiology, the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, China; and \u2020Department of Oro-maxillofacial Head and Neck Oncology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xia", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wen Xian", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "PubDate": "2017Sep"}, {"PMID": "28740549", "Title": "Targeted Delivery to Tumor-associated Pericytes via an Affibody with High Affinity for PDGFR\u03b2 Enhances the in vivo Antitumor Effects of Human TRAIL.", "Abstract": "Human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (hTRAIL) has exhibited superior in vitro cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cells. However, hTRAIL showed a disappointing anticancer effect in clinical trials, although hTRAIL-based regimens were well tolerated. One important reason might be that hTRAIL was largely trapped by its decoy receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed on normal cells. Tumor-targeted delivery might improve the tumor uptake and thus enhance the antitumor effect of hTRAIL. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-expressing pericytes are enriched in tumor tissues derived both from patients with colon cancer and from mice bearing colorectal tumor xenografts. A ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody showed high affinity (nM) for PDGFR\u03b2 and was predominantly distributed on tumor-associated PDGFR\u03b2-positive pericytes. Co-administration with the ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody did not significantly enhance the antitumor effect of hTRAIL in mice bearing tumor xenografts. Fusion to the ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody endows hTRAIL with PDGFR\u03b2-binding ability but does not interfere with its death receptor binding and activation. The fused ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody mediated PDGFR\u03b2-dependent binding of hTRAIL to pericytes. In addition, hTRAIL bound on pericytes could kill tumor cells through juxtatropic activity or exhibit cytotoxicity in tumor cells after being released from pericytes. Intravenously injected hTRAIL fused to ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody initially accumulated on tumor-associated pericytes and then diffused to the tumor parenchyma over time. Fusion to the ZPDGFR\u03b2 affibody increased the tumor uptake of hTRAIL, thus enhancing the antitumor effect of hTRAIL in mice bearing tumor xenografts.

The structure of the postfusion conformation of gB has been solved for several herpesviruses; however, the gB prefusion crystal structure and the details of how the protein refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion form to mediate fusion have not been determined. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we previously reported that three mutations (I671A, H681A, and F683A) in the C-terminal arm of the gB ectodomain greatly reduced cell-cell fusion. This fusion deficit could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation, suggesting that the gB triple mutant was not misfolded. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed two independent herpes simplex virus 1 mutant strains (gB 3A) carrying the three arm mutations. The gB 3A viruses have 200-fold smaller plaques than the wild-type virus and demonstrate remarkably delayed entry into cells. Single-step and multistep growth curves show that gB 3A viruses have delayed replication kinetics. Interestingly, incubation at 40\u00b0C promoted the entry of the gB 3A viruses. We propose that the gB 3A viruses' entry deficit is due to a loss of interactions between residues in the gB C-terminal arm and the coiled-coil core of gB. The results suggest that the triple alanine mutation may destabilize the postfusion gB conformation and/or stabilize the prefusion gB conformation and that exposure to elevated temperatures can overcome the defect in gB 3A viruses.IMPORTANCE Because of its complexity, the mechanism of herpesvirus entry into cells is not well understood. Our study investigated one of the most important unanswered questions about herpesvirus entry; i.e., how does the herpesvirus fusion protein gB mediate membrane fusion? gB is an essential protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and is thought to undergo a conformational change to provide the energy to fuse the viral and cellular membranes. Using our understanding of the structure of gB, we designed mutations in the gB \"arm\" region that we predicted would impede gB function. We introduced these mutations into herpes simplex virus 1 by using a bacterial artificial chromosome, and the mutant virus exhibited a drastically delayed rate of entry.

We found that the N-terminus of gD tolerates long insertions, whereas residues adjacent to the gD Ig-like V-type core tolerated shorter insertions (up to 15 amino acids), but not greater than 60 amino acids. Recombinant HSV-1 containing the ch14.18 single chain variable fragment (scFv) at the N-terminus of gD failed to mediate entry, even though the ch14.18 scFv-gD chimera Fc bound to neuroblastoma cells expressing GD2.

A rapid and high-throughput GenomeLab Gene Expression Profiler (GeXP) analyzer-based multiplex PCR assay was developed for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of these six cattle viruses. Six pairs of chimeric primers consisting of both the gene-specific primer and a universal primer were designed and used for amplification. Then capillary electrophoresis was used to separate the fluorescent labeled PCR products according to the amplicons size. The specificity of GeXP-multiplex PCR assay was examined with samples of the single template and mixed template of six viruses. The sensitivity was evaluated using the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay on serial 10-fold dilutions of ssRNAs obtained via in vitro transcription. To further evaluate the reliability, 305 clinical samples were tested by the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay. The results showed that the corresponding virus specific fragments of genes were amplified. The detection limit of the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay was 100 copies/\u03bcL in a mixed sample of ssRNAs containing target genes of six different cattle viruses, whereas the detection limit for the Gexp-mono PCR assay for a single target gene was 10 copies/\u03bcL. In detection of viruses in 305 clinical samples, the results of GeXP were consistent with simplex real-time PCR. Analysis of positive samples by sequencing demonstrated that the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay had no false positive samples of nonspecific amplification. In conclusion, this GeXP-multiplex PCR assay is a high throughput, specific, sensitive, rapid and simple method for the detection and differentiation of six cattle viruses.

PEGylation is a well-established method and has been clinically proven to improve pharmacokinetics. mmTRAIL exhibited supercytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cells, but its serum half-life was less than 10 min in mice. Here, mmTRAIL-5K, mmTRAIL-10K, and mmTRAIL-20K were produced by N-terminus-specific PEGylation of mmTRAIL with 5, 10, or 20 kDa mPEG, respectively. The particle sizes of mmTRAIL-5K, mmTRAIL-10K, and mmTRAIL-20K were 9.09 \u00b1 2.76, 12.62 \u00b1 4.05, and 15.68 \u00b1 4.95 nm, which were higher than the threshold (\u223c7 nm) of renal clearance. Accordingly, mmTRAIL-5K exhibited a serum half-life of 30 min only 3 times longer than that of mmTRAIL. However, both mmTRAIL-10K and mmTRAIL-20K exhibited similar serum half-lives ranging from 350 to 400 min, indicating that PEGylation with 10 or 20 kDa mPEG significantly improved the pharmacokinetics of mmTRAIL. However, death receptor binding of mmTRAIL-20K was reduced 5- to 8-fold, resulting in a 3-fold reduction of cytotoxicity. Additionally, repeated administration of mmTRAIL-20K elicited both mPEG-specific IgG and IgM antibody responses in rats. In contrast, the receptor binding and cytotoxicity of mmTRAIL-10K were similar to those of mmTRAIL. Repeated administration of mmTRAIL-10K did not obviously stimulate mPEG-specific antibody responses in rats and rhesus monkeys. Of the three PEGylated mmTRAIL analogues, mmTRAIL-10K exerted the greatest tumor suppression in mice bearing human tumor xenografts. These results demonstrated that conjugation of mmTRAIL to 10 kDa mPEG was better than that to 5 or 20 kDa mPEG for enhancing antitumor effects.", "Keywords": ["PEGylation", "anti-PEG antibody", "cancer targeted therapy", "serum half-life", "tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin M", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Protein Binding", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qianxue", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Dianlong", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanru", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiuxiao", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaofeng", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041, China."}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "PubDate": "2017Feb06"}, {"PMID": "27185658", "Title": "Roles of T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin Domain Genes and Toll-like Receptors in Wheezy Children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae Pneumonia.", "Abstract": "The study aimed to explore possible factors influencing wheezing in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP).", "Keywords": ["Inflammatory factors", "Mycoplasma pneumoniae", "T-cell immunoglobulin", "Wheeze"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cytokines", "Female", "Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1", "Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mycoplasma pneumoniae", "Pneumonia, Mycoplasma", "Respiratory Sounds", "Toll-Like Receptor 2", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital, Shandong, 250001, China.

present study was conducted to identify avian reovirus (ARV) proteins that can activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt pathway. Based on ARV protein amino acid sequence analysis, \u03c3A, \u03c3NS, \u03bcA, \u03bcB and \u03bcNS were identified as putative proteins capable of mediating PI3K/Akt pathway activation. The recombinant plasmids \u03c3A-pcAGEN, \u03c3NS-pcAGEN, \u03bcA-pcAGEN, \u03bcB-pcAGEN and \u03bcNS-pcAGEN were constructed and used to transfect Vero cells, and the expression levels of the corresponding genes were quantified by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) levels in the transfected cells were measured by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The results showed that the \u03c3A, \u03c3NS, \u03bcA, \u03bcB and \u03bcNS genes were expressed in Vero cells. \u03c3A-expressing and \u03c3NS-expressing cells had higher P-Akt levels than negative control cells, pcAGEN-expressing cells and cells designed to express other proteins (i.e., \u03bcA, \u03bcB and \u03bcNS). Pre-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation in \u03c3A- and \u03c3NS-expressing cells. These results indicate that the \u03c3A and \u03c3NS proteins can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bird Diseases", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Gene Expression Regulation, Viral", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Orthoreovirus, Avian", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Reoviridae Infections", "Signal Transduction", "Vero Cells", "Viral Core Proteins", "Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liji", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhixun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China. xiezhixun@126.com."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Sisi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaoling", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Xianwen", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiqin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanfang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemic Etiology and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai North Road, Nanning, 530001, China."}], "Journal": "Archives of virology", "PubDate": "2016Aug"}, {"PMID": "27159718", "Title": "Complete sequence determination and analysis of the Guangxi Phasianus colchicus (Galliformes: Phasianidae) mitochondrial genome.", "Abstract": "The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Guangxi Phasianus colchicus was measured by PCR-based methods and analyzed in detail.

Using endogenous albumin as a carrier is an attractive approach for circulatory half-life extension. Here, we produced ABD-hTRAIL and hTRAIL-ABD by fusing the albumin-binding domain (ABD) from protein G to the N- or C-terminus of hTRAIL. We found that ABD-hTRAIL bound human serum albumin (HSA) with a high affinity (0.4 \u00b1 0.18 nM) and formed nanoparticles with an average diameter (~12 nm) above the threshold (~7 nm) of renal filtration. ABD-hTRAIL also bound mouse serum albumin (MSA); thus, its half-life was 40-50-fold greater than that of hTRAIL (14.1 \u00b1 0.87 h vs 0.32 \u00b1 0.14 h). Tumor uptake of ABD-hTRAIL 8-48 h post-injection was 6-16-fold that of hTRAIL. Consequently, the tumor suppression of ABD-hTRAIL in mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts was 3-4 times greater than that of hTRAIL. Additionally, the time period during which ABD-hTRAIL could kill circulating tumor cells was approximately 8 times longer than that of hTRAIL. These results demonstrate that ABD fused to the N-terminus endows hTRAIL with albumin binding ability; once it enters the vasculature, ABD mediates binding with endogenous albumin, thus prolonging the half-life and enhancing the antitumor effect of hTRAIL. However, hTRAIL-ABD did not show a high affinity for albumin and therefore did not display the prolonged circulatory half-life and enhanced antitumor effects. These results demonstrate that N-terminal, but not C-terminal, ABD-fusion is an efficient technique for enhancing the antitumor effects of hTRAIL by using endogenous albumin as a carrier.", "Keywords": ["Albumin", "Albumin-binding domain", "Anti-cancer drug", "Cancer biotherapy", "Drug delivery", "Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplasms", "Protein Binding", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Serum Albumin", "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China; Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Dianlong", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China; Regenerative Medical Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Qianxue", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Huawei", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaofeng", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.

As an important adipokine secreted by white adipose tissue, leptin may be a key mediator in the progression of OA. Leptin exerts a catabolic effect on OA cartilage by increasing the production of metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes, and contributes to apoptosis in chondrocytes. The current study aimed to explore the role of leptin on the apoptosis of chondrocytes in OA, and its underlying mechanisms. In the in vitro model of OA used in the present study, administration of exogenous leptin induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in chondrocytes. It has been demonstrated that leptin is associated with the pathogenesis of OA via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)\u2011signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, and data gathered in the present study demonstrated that suppression of this signaling pathway using a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, significantly ameliorated leptin\u2011induced apoptosis in damaged chondrocytes in vitro, and reduced the generation of ROS. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of MMP\u201113 and B\u2011cell lymphoma 2\u2011associated X protein were downregulated in the AG490\u2011treated group.

Previously, we constructed the chimeric peptide BB28 by fusing bombesin to a mitochondria-disrupting peptide. BB28 selectively induced the apoptosis of various tumor cells in vitro and showed promising in vivo antitumor effects. In general, a short circulating half-life limits the in vivo effect of peptides. To prolong the half-life of BB28, here, we generated the novel peptide ABB28 by fusing an albumin-binding domain (ABD) to the N-terminus of BB28. ABB28 exhibited much higher binding affinity for albumin than BB28, and this modification extended the peptide half-life from several minutes to 2 h. Optical imaging revealed that ABB28 accumulated in xenografted tumors within 1h post-injection and persisted at an evident level for up to 24 h. ABB28 exerted stronger tumor-suppressive effects than BB28. Significant differences in the tumor volumes (P<0.001) and the tumor weights (P=0.002) were observed between ABB28- and BB28-treated mice. Moreover, ABB28 exhibited tumor suppression comparable to that of PEGylated 5K-BB28 in vivo.

regimen simulating the clinical treatment of patients with epilepsy, on P-glycoprotein (P-GP) overexpression in a pentylenetetrazole-kindled mouse model of epilepsy. Epilepsy was induced by intraperitoneal administration of pentylenetetrazole (40 mg/kg) for 7 days followed by intragastric administration of PHT (40 mg/kg) for 14 days. Thirty mice that developed seizures were randomly divided into three groups and administered PHT as well as the following treatments: saline (negative control); verapamil (20 mg/kg, positive control); and G. biloba (30 mg/kg). Seizure severity was recorded 30 minutes after treatment on Day 4 of drug administration, after which the mice were euthanized, and their brains isolated. Western blots and immunohistochemistry were performed to analyze the expression of P-GP and caspase-3, respectively, in the brain tissue. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure the concentrations of PHT in the brains of the treated mice. After 4 consecutive days of treatment, the seizure severity in the mice in the G. biloba extract group was more significantly reduced than the seizure severity in the saline control group, and a significant difference was observed between the G. biloba extract and verapamil control groups (p < 0.05). P-GP expression in the brain more significantly decreased in the mice treated with G. biloba extract and verapamil than it did in the saline-treated control group (p < 0.05). Compared with the saline-treated control group, the mice treated with G. biloba extract and verapamil showed significantly increased brain PHT concentrations (p < 0.05). Furthermore, caspase-3 expression in the brain tissue of the G. biloba extract group was significantly lower than that in the vehicle control group (p < 0.05); this finding demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of G. biloba. Therefore, this study showed that treatment with G. biloba extract in combination with PHT prevented the upregulation of P-GP expression in mice.

Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which CA inhibits hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced injury in HepG2 cells. Cells were pretreated with 2.5-10 \u03bcmol/L CA for 2 h and then exposed to 3 mmol/L H2O2 for an additional 4 h. CA dose-dependently increased cell viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activities. Pretreatment with CA completely attenuated the inhibited expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and the B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), and reduced glutathione activity caused by H2O2, whereas it reversed reactive oxygen species accumulation and the increase in cleaved caspase-3. Importantly, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, was significantly increased by CA. Considering the above results, we hypothesized that SIRT1 may play important roles in the protective effects of CA in injury induced by H2O2. As expected, SIRT1 suppression by Ex527 (6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide) and siRNA-mediated SIRT1 silencing (si-SIRT1) significantly aggravated the H2O2-induced increased level of cleaved caspase-3 but greatly reduced the decreased expression of MnSOD and Bcl-xL.

For most alphaherpesviruses, the minimal set of viral proteins required for fusion with the host cell includes glycoproteins gD, gB, and a gH/gL heterodimer. In the current model of entry, gD binds to a cellular receptor and transmits a signal to gH/gL. This signal then triggers gB, the conserved fusion protein, to insert into the target membrane and refold to merge the viral and cellular membranes. We previously demonstrated that gB homologs from two alphaherpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1), were interchangeable. In contrast, neither gD nor gH/gL functioned with heterotypic entry glycoproteins, indicating that gD and gH/gL exhibit an essential type-specific functional interaction. To map this homotypic interaction site on gH/gL, we generated HSV-1/SaHV-1 gH and gL chimeras. The functional interaction with HSV-1 gD mapped to the N-terminal domains I and II of the HSV-1 gH ectodomain. The core of HSV-1 gL that interacts with gH also was required for functional homotypic interaction.

However, APAP overdose is the principal cause of acute liver failure in Western countries. Salvianolic acid B (SalB), a major water-soluble compound extracted from Radix Salvia miltiorrhiza, has well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We aimed to evaluate the ability of SalB to protect against APAP-induced acute hepatotoxicity by inducing nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression. SalB pretreatment ameliorated acute liver injury caused by APAP, as indicated by blood aspartate transaminase levels and histological findings. Moreover, SalB pretreatment increased the expression of Nrf2, Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutamate-l-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). Furthermore, the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin and the GCLC inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine reversed the protective effect of SalB. Additionally, siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 reduced the induction of HO-1 and GCLC by SalB, and SalB pretreatment activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. Both inhibitors (PI3K and PKC) blocked the protective effect of SalB against APAP-induced cell death, abolishing the SalB-induced Nrf2 activation and decreasing HO-1 and GCLC expression.

Cell-cell fusion assays indicate that SaHV-1 entry glycoproteins function with the previously identified alphaherpesvirus entry receptors nectin-1 and CD155 but not with herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) or paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha (PILR\u03b1). Replacement of HSV-1 gD with the SaHV-1 gD homolog resulted in a complete loss of fusion function when coexpressed with HSV-1 gB and gH/gL. HSV-1 gD was also unable to substitute for SaHV-1 gD when coexpressed with SaHV-1 gB and gH/gL. Similarly, the gH/gL heterodimers from HSV-1 and SaHV-1 were not interchangeable. In contrast, both the HSV-1 and SaHV-1 gB homologs retained function in a heterotypic context. These results suggest that an essential interaction between homotypic gD and gH/gL occurs during both HSV-1 and SaHV-1 entry. To map the site of this homotypic interaction, we created a series of gD chimeras, focusing on the \"profusion domain\" (PFD) that consists of HSV-1 gD residues 261 to 305 or SaHV-1 gD residues 264 to 307. We identified a seven-amino-acid stretch (264 RTLPPPK 270) at the N terminus of the SaHV-1 gD PFD that contributes to homotypic fusion.

Southern China is regarded as the world \"influenza epicenter\", due to a rash of outbreaks of influenza in recent years. In this study, we conducted an epidemiological survey of LPAIV at different live bird markets (LBMs) in Guangxi province, Southern China. From January 2009 to December 2011, we collected 3,121 cotton swab samples of larynx, trachea and cloaca from the poultry at LBMs in Guangxi. Virus isolation, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and RT-PCR were used to detect and subtype LPAIV in the collected samples. Of the 3,121 samples, 336 samples (10.8%) were LPAIV positive, including 54 (1.7%) in chicken and 282 (9.1%) in duck. The identified LPAIV were H3N1, H3N2, H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, H6N8, and H9N2, which are combinations of seven HA subtypes (H1, H3, H4, H6, H9, H10 and H11) and five NA subtypes (N1, N2, N5, N6 and N8). The H3 and H9 subtypes are predominant in the identified LPAIVs. Among the 336 cases, 29 types of mixed infection of different HA subtypes were identified in 87 of the cases (25.9%).

Neuroimaging studies of patients with OCD in China started to appear in the late 1990s, identifying structural abnormalities in the gray matter and white matter of the prefrontal lobe, the corpus striatum, and the thalamus. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have found increased metabolism and activation in these brain regions that are correlated with the duration, severity and cognitive symptoms of OCD.

Two sets of specific oligonucleotide primers for Haplosporidium spp. and Perkinsus spp., along with two hydrolysis probes specific for each parasite group, were used in the assay. The dq-PCR results were detected and analyzed using the Light Cycler 2.0 software system. The dq-PCR identified and differentiated the two protozoan parasite groups. The sensitivity of the dq-PCR assay was 200 template copies for both Haplosporidium spp. and Perkinsus spp. No DNA product was amplified when known DNA from Marteilia refringens, Toxoplasma gondii, Bonamia ostreae, Escherichia coli, Cymndinium spp., Mykrocytos mackini, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and shellfish tissue were used as templates. A total of 840 oyster samples from commercial cultivated shellfish farms from two coastal areas in China were randomly collected and tested by dq-PCR. The detection rate of Haplosporidium spp. was 8.6% in the Qindao, Shandong coastal area, whereas Perkinsus spp. was 8.3% coastal oysters cultivated from shellfish farms of Beihai, Guangxi. The dqPCR results suggested that Haplosporidium spp. was prevalent in oysters from Qindao, Shandong, while Perkinsus spp. was prevalent in oysters from the coastal areas of Beihai, Guangxi.
