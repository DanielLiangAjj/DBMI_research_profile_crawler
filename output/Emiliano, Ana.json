Accordingly, in this study, middle-aged obese female and male mice were randomized to one of three groups: sleeve gastrectomy (SG), sham surgery ad libitum (SH-AL), or sham surgery with weight matching to SG through intermittent fasting with calorie restriction (SH-IF). Comprehensive measures of energy and glucose homeostasis, including energy intake, body weight, energy expenditure, glucose and insulin tolerance, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) sympathetic innervation density were obtained. At the end of 8 wk, SG and SH-IF females had better metabolic outcomes than their male counterparts. SG females had improved weight loss maintenance, preservation of fat-free mass (FFM), higher total energy expenditure (TEE), normal locomotor activity, and reduced plasma insulin and white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammatory markers. SH-IF females also had lower plasma insulin and WAT inflammatory markers, and higher TEE than SH-IF males, despite their lower FFM. In addition, SH-IF females had higher iBAT sympathetic nerve density than SG and SH-AL females, whereas there were no differences among males. Notably, SH-IF mice of both sexes had the most improved glucose tolerance, highlighting the benefits of fasting, irrespective of weight loss. Results from this study demonstrate that in middle-aged obese mice, female sex is associated with better metabolic outcomes after SG or IF with calorie restriction. Clinical studies are needed to determine if sex differences should guide the choice of obesity therapies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY SG or IF with calorie restriction produces better metabolic outcomes in females than in males. IF with calorie restriction prevents metabolic adaptation, even in the face of fat-free mass loss. IF with calorie restriction in females only, is associated with increased iBAT sympathetic innervation, which possibly mitigates reductions in energy expenditure secondary to fat-free mass loss. Lastly, IF leads to better glucose homeostasis than SG, irrespective of sex.", "Keywords": ["brown adipose tissue", "energy expenditure", "glucose homeostasis", "leptin", "metabolic adaptation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Fasting", "Gastrectomy", "Glucose", "Insulins", "Mice, Obese", "Obesity", "Sex Characteristics", "Weight Loss"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ana B", "Last Name": "Emiliano", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Natalie R", "Last Name": "Lopatinsky", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marko", "Last Name": "Kraljevi\u0107", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sei", "Last Name": "Higuchi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Haeusler", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gary J", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

The mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood, but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions. Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119 agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential physiological role in humans.
