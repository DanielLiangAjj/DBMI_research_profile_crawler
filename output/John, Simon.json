[{"PMID": "38895321", "Title": "TLR4 deficiency does not alter glaucomatous progression in a mouse model of chronic glaucoma.", "Abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern-recognition transmembrane receptor that induces neuroinflammatory processes in response to injury. Tlr4 is highly expressed in ocular tissues and is known to modulate inflammatory processes in both anterior and posterior segment tissues. TLR4 activation can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic deficits in inflammatory disorders. Due to its effects on inflammation and metabolism, TLR4 is a candidate to participate in glaucoma pathogenesis. It has been suggested as a therapeutic target based on studies using acute models, such as experimentally raising IOP to ischemia-inducing levels. Nevertheless, its role in chronic glaucoma needs further evaluation. In the current study, we investigated the role of TLR4 in an inherited mouse model of chronic glaucoma, DBA/2J. To do this, we analyzed the effect of Tlr4 knockout (Tlr4 -/-) on glaucoma-associated phenotypes in DBA/2J mice. Our studies found no significant differences in intraocular pressure, iris disease, or glaucomatous progression in Tlr4 -/- compared to Tlr4 +/+ DBA/2J mice. These data do not identify a role for TLR4 in this chronic glaucoma, but further research is warranted to understand its role in other glaucoma models and different genetic contexts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Sim\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Harder", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME."}, {"First Name": "Haeyn", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Christa", "Last Name": "Montgomery", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Simon W M", "Last Name": "John", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun08"}, {"PMID": "37886472", "Title": "Transcriptomic profiling of Schlemm's canal cells reveals a lymphatic-biased identity and three major cell states.", "Abstract": "Schlemm's canal (SC) is central in intraocular pressure regulation but requires much characterization. It has distinct inner and outer walls, each composed of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells (SECs) with different morphologies and functions. Recent transcriptomic studies of the anterior segment added important knowledge, but were limited in power by SEC numbers or did not focus on SC. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of SC biology, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on C57BL/6J SC, blood vessel, and lymphatic endothelial cells from limbal tissue (~4500 SECs). We also analyzed mouse limbal tissues by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (C57BL/6J and 129/Sj strains), successfully sequencing 903 individual SECs. Together, these datasets confirm that SC has molecular characteristics of both blood and lymphatic endothelia with a lymphatic phenotype predominating. SECs are enriched in pathways that regulate cell-cell junction formation pointing to the importance of junctions in determining SC fluid permeability. Importantly, and for the first time, our analyses characterize 3 molecular classes of SECs, molecularly distinguishing inner wall from outer wall SECs and discovering two inner wall cell states that likely result from local environmental differences. Further, and based on ligand and receptor expression patterns, we document key interactions between SECs and cells of the adjacent trabecular meshwork (TM) drainage tissue. Also, we present cell type expression for a collection of human glaucoma genes. These data provide a new molecular foundation that will enable the functional dissection of key homeostatic processes mediated by SECs as well as the development of new glaucoma therapeutics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Revathi", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Krishnakumar", "Last Name": "Kizhatil", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine."}, {"First Name": "Taibo", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Tolman", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Aakriti", "Last Name": "Bhandari", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Graham", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine."}, {"First Name": "Violet", "Last Name": "Bupp-Chickering", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ruth A", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University, NC."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Peregrin", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Sim\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Christa", "Last Name": "Montgomery", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "W Daniel", "Last Name": "Stamer", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University, NC."}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD."}, {"First Name": "Simon W M", "Last Name": "John", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan23"}, {"PMID": "36351424", "Title": "CyclinD2-mediated regulation of neurogenic output from the retinal ciliary margin is perturbed in albinism.", "Abstract": "In albinism, aberrations in the ipsi-/contralateral retinal ganglion cell (RGC) ratio compromise the functional integrity of the binocular circuit. Here, we focus on the mouse ciliary margin zone (CMZ), a neurogenic niche at the embryonic peripheral retina, to investigate developmental processes regulating RGC neurogenesis and identity acquisition. We found that the mouse ventral CMZ generates predominantly ipsilaterally projecting RGCs, but this output is altered in the albino visual system because of CyclinD2 downregulation and disturbed timing of the cell cycle. Consequently, albino as well as CyclinD2-deficient pigmented mice exhibit diminished ipsilateral retinogeniculate projection and poor depth perception. In albino mice, pharmacological stimulation of calcium channels, known to upregulate CyclinD2 in other cell types, augmented CyclinD2-dependent neurogenesis of ipsilateral RGCs and improved stereopsis.

Mutations in human PYCR1 and ALDH18A1 (P5C Synthetase) cause Cutis Laxa (CL), whereas mutations in PYCR2 cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 10 (HLD10). Here, we investigated the genetics of Pycr1 and Pycr2 in mice. A null allele of Pycr1 did not show integument or CL-related phenotypes. We also studied a novel chemically-induced mutation in Pycr2. Mice with recessive loss-of-function mutations in Pycr2 showed phenotypes consistent with neurological and neuromuscular disorders, including weight loss, kyphosis, and hind-limb clasping. The peripheral nervous system was largely unaffected, with only mild axonal atrophy in peripheral nerves. A severe loss of subcutaneous fat in Pycr2 mutant mice is reminiscent of a CL-like phenotype, but primary features such as elastin abnormalities were not observed. Aged Pycr2 mutant mice had reduced white blood cell counts and altered lipid metabolism, suggesting a generalized metabolic disorder. PYCR1 and -2 have similar enzymatic and cellular activities, and consistent with previous studies, both were localized in the mitochondria in fibroblasts. Both PYCR1 and -2 were able to complement the loss of Pro3, the yeast enzyme that converts P5C to proline, confirming their activity as P5C reductases. In mice, Pycr1; Pycr2 double mutants were sub-viable and unhealthy compared to either single mutant, indicating the genes are largely functionally redundant. Proline levels were not reduced, and precursors were not increased in serum from Pycr2 mutant mice or in lysates from skin fibroblast cultures, but placing Pycr2 mutant mice on a proline-free diet worsened the phenotype. Thus, Pycr1 and -2 have redundant functions in proline biosynthesis, and their loss makes proline a semi-essential amino acid. These findings have implications for understanding the genetics of CL and HLD10, and for modeling these disorders in mice.", "Keywords": ["adipocyte", "cutis laxa", "elastin", "hypomyelinating leukodystrophy", "metabolism", "proline synthesis", "skin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Proline", "Pyrroline Carboxylate Reductases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Morgane G", "Last Name": "Stum", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abigail L D", "Last Name": "Tadenev", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin L", "Last Name": "Seburn", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathy E", "Last Name": "Miers", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pak P", "Last Name": "Poon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christopher R", "Last Name": "McMaster", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Coleen", "Last Name": "Kane", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen A", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul F", "Last Name": "Cliften", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Sundberg", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura G", "Last Name": "Reinholdt", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon W M", "Last Name": "John", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert W", "Last Name": "Burgess", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA."}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2021May17"}, {"PMID": "33462143", "Title": "Genetic background modifies vulnerability to glaucoma-related phenotypes in Lmx1b mutant mice.", "Abstract": "Variants in the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1-beta (LMX1B) gene predispose individuals to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a key risk factor for glaucoma. However, the effect of LMX1B mutations varies widely between individuals.

Strain background had a significant effect on the onset and severity of ocular phenotypes in Lmx1bV265D/+ mutant mice. Mice of the B6 background were the most susceptible to developing abnormal IOP distribution, severe anterior segment developmental anomalies (including malformed eccentric pupils, iridocorneal strands and corneal abnormalities) and glaucomatous nerve damage. By contrast, Lmx1bV265D mice of the 129 background were the most resistant to developing anterior segment abnormalities, had less severe IOP elevation than B6 mutants at young ages and showed no detectable nerve damage. To identify genetic modifiers of susceptibility to Lmx1bV265D -induced glaucoma-associated phenotypes, we performed a mapping cross between mice of the B6 (susceptible) and 129 (resistant) backgrounds. We identified a modifier locus on Chromosome 18, with the 129 allele(s) substantially lessening severity of ocular phenotypes, as confirmed by congenic analysis.

Subsequent metabolic studies characterized an intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent decline in retinal pyruvate levels coupled to dysregulated glucose metabolism prior to detectable optic nerve degeneration.

Oral supplementation of the glycolytic product pyruvate strongly protected from neurodegeneration in both rat and mouse models of glaucoma.

Rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR robustly prevented glaucomatous neurodegeneration, supporting a damaging role for IOP-induced mTOR activation in perturbing metabolism and promoting glaucoma.

Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for glaucoma and recent work has demonstrated critical early neuroinflammatory insults occur in the optic nerve head following ocular hypertension. Microglia and infiltrating monocytes are likely candidates to drive these neuroinflammatory insults. However, the exact molecular identity / transcriptomic profile of microglia following ocular hypertensive insults is unknown. To elucidate the molecular identity of microglia after long-term exposure to ocular hypertension, we used a mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2\u2009J). We performed RNA-sequencing of microglia mRNA from the optic nerve head at a time point following ocular hypertensive insults, but preceding detectable neurodegeneration (with microglia identified as being CD45lo/CD11b+/CD11c-). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing was performed on optic nerve head microglia from mice treated with radiation therapy, a potent therapy preventing neuroinflammatory insults. Transcriptomic profiling of optic nerve head microglia mRNA identifies metabolic priming with marked changes in mitochondrial gene expression, and changes to phagocytosis, inflammatory, and sensome pathways. The data predict that many functions of microglia that help maintain tissue homeostasis are affected. Comparative analysis of these data with data from previously published whole optic nerve head tissue or monocyte-only samples from DBA/2\u2009J mice demonstrate that many of the neuroinflammatory signatures in these data sets arise from infiltrating monocytes and not reactive microglia. Finally, our data demonstrate that prophylactic\u00a0radiation therapy of DBA/2\u2009J mice potently abolishes these microglia metabolic transcriptomic changes at the same time points.
