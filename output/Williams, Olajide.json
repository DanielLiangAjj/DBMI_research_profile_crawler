This article describes the development and validation of the stroke literacy assessment test (SLAT)-pertaining to the Life's Simple Seven (LS7) risk factors for stroke-for evaluating CHWs' competencies in the context of education and training programs. The SLAT was developed using an iterative instrument design protocol, followed by empirically testing the instrument in 68 CHWs from the Columbia University Institute for Training Outreach and Community Health (InTOuCH) in New York. Data collection began in March 2021 and continued through May 2021. The evaluation was based on four types of validity evidence: (a) content validation with expert reviews of items and overall domain, (b) validation on examinee response processes with cognitive interviews, (c) item validation and diagnostic analysis, and (d) validity evidence based on expected directional group differences. In addition, the internal consistency reliability of the total test scores, with the best functioning items, were evaluated. Two such iterative cycles yielded a 34-item, written structured response test that assesses the factual knowledge and application levels of cognition, and demonstrates sufficient validity and reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .69) for use with CHWs specializing in stroke prevention efforts.

Evidence suggests that digital innovation can greatly benefit health education, including nutrition programs. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education sector, forcing schools to modify standard practices from exclusively in-person delivery to online or blended learning. Digitalized curriculums became particularly useful as an Emergency Remote Teaching tool. This article focuses on developing and implementing a multimedia, multisensory, and scalable Hip-Hop Healthy Eating and Living in Schools (H.E.A.L.S.) Nutrition-Math Curriculum (NMC). NMC comprises 20 lessons-music-based multimedia resources used in the classroom or at home. Fourteen lessons represent self-directed online modules (asynchronous learning) hosted on a Learning Management System (LMS) called \"Gooru.\" The remaining six lessons are teacher-facilitated (in person or using Zoom) review sessions (synchronous learning). The article discusses (1) the development of NMC through the lens of the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model (MMHEM), (2) the high acceptability of NMC evaluated using a mixed-methods design among minoritized fifth-grade students attending an after-school program, and (3) the students' completion and mastery rates of the NMC modules based on LMS data.

There is a critical need to close this knowledge gap by investigating novel factors that may contribute to stroke disparities. Allostatic load (AL) is the lifetime adverse physiologic impact of needing to adjust to socially structured stressors such as racism. AL has been shown to increase health vulnerability and worsen outcomes in marginalized populations. We sought to assess the differential impact of AL on cognitive outcomes post intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) across race-ethnicity. The Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project (ICHOP) prospectively collected data from patients presenting to Columbia Medical Center with ICH from 3/2009 to 5/2016. Data included demographics, stroke scores, labs, complications, neuroimaging, medical history, and discharge data. Five markers of AL (HbA1c, WBC, SBP, HR, ALB) were obtained. An AL score was generated by summing the elements in each patient that fell outside normal ranges, with AL score ranging 0-5. A linear regression model, adjusted for stroke severity and ICH volumes, was used to evaluate the relationship between AL and Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) at discharge, stratified by race-ethnicity. Among 248 white, 195 black, and 261 Hispanic ICH patients, neither mean AL nor mean TICS differed by race/ethnicity (p\u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009=\u20090.79 respectively). In the overall cohort AL did not predict TICS at discharge (Beta -1.0, SE 1.1, p\u2009=\u20090.353). In Whites (beta 1.18, SE 2.5, p\u2009=\u20090.646) and Hispanics (beta -0.95, SE 1.6, p\u2009=\u20090.552) AL was not associated with TICS at discharge. In Black patients, higher AL was associated with a decrease in TICS at discharge (beta -3.2, SE 1.5, p\u2009=\u20090.049).

In the United States, stroke prevention interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) have been proven to be highly effective in preventing the onset of MRFs. We conducted a scoping review of the competency assessment methods used in CVD and stroke-focused CHW training programs. We searched six online databases: PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and HaPI, from all available years until January 2021. Of the 1,774 initial articles found, we identified 30 eligible articles to be included in the review. Nine of these studies used previously validated instruments, whereas the remaining 21 studies used tools from the training curriculum or independently developed instruments. Only five of these validated tools reported psychometric properties; none of them were designed for the CHW population.

Individuals who failed the vision screening were scheduled with an on-site optometrist for an eye exam; those with ocular pathologies were referred to an ophthalmologist. Participants were also administered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-8 (NEI-VFQ-8) and Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test by community health workers.Results:Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a042) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 70.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8, female (61.9%), and Hispanic (78.6%). Most individuals (78.6%, n =\u00a033) failed vision screening. Of those who failed, 84.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a028) attended the on-site eye exam with the optometrist. Ocular diagnoses: refractive error 13/28 (46.4%), glaucoma/glaucoma suspect 9/28 (32.1%), cataract 7/28 (25.0%), retina abnormalities 6/28 (21.4%); 13 people required eyeglasses.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using CHWs and patient navigators for reducing barriers to vision screening and optometrist-based eye exams in vulnerable populations, ultimately improving early detection of eye disease and linking individuals to additional eye care appointments. The full five-year study aims to further examine these outcomes.", "Keywords": ["Glaucoma detection", "access to eye care", "community-based", "vision screening", "vulnerable populations"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Community Health Services", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Behavior", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New York City", "Patient Navigation", "Risk Factors", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Vision Disorders", "Vision Screening", "Vulnerable Populations"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa A", "Last Name": "Hark", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Camille S", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yocheved S", "Last Name": "Kresch", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "C Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Auran", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Univertsity, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Prakash", "Last Name": "Gorroochurn", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stella", "Last Name": "Stempel", "Affiliation": "Edward S.

promotion frameworks have been at the forefront of public health research and practice. A multilevel focus, as exemplified by the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM), is one common denominator among these frameworks. The SEM highlights important social and ecological influences on health behavior by delineating the different levels of influence. These include public policy, organizational, community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal levels, which, when considered during the development of health promotion campaigns, especially those that focus on health education, strengthen the potential influence of that campaign on targeted behaviors. However, the SEM lacks a complimenting framework for understanding the role of conventional and unconventional approaches to health education; that is, how to design a health education intervention that considers both the context, such as the social and ecological levels of influence, and the best approaches for developing and delivering the health education in a manner that optimizes their effectiveness in today's modern and increasingly diverse world. Addressing this gap, the current article presents an integrative Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model (MMHEM), which incorporates three key domains-(1) Art (innovativeness/creativity), (2) Culture (cultural tailoring), and (3) Science (evidence-based), while promoting the importance of considering the socio-ecological levels of influence on targeted behaviors. Using a successful health education intervention, called the Hip Hop Stroke, we deconstruct the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model and discuss its potential role as a guide for developing public health education interventions.", "Keywords": ["Socio-Ecological Model", "Stroke Education", "health communication", "health promotion", "public health education"], "MeSH terms": ["Health Education", "Models, Theoretical", "Multilevel Analysis", "Public Health", "Public Policy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Olajide", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA. ow11@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ewelina M", "Last Name": "Swierad", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA. es2818@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "PubDate": "2019Mar10"}, {"PMID": "30671157", "Title": "Impact of Patient Language on Emergency Medical Service Use and Prenotification for Acute Ischemic Stroke.", "Abstract": "Use of emergency medical services (EMS) is associated with decreased door-to-needle time in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Stroke incidence and prevalence is not uniform. It occurs more frequently in some geographical areas of the United States and the rates are higher in minority groups.(1,2) Some proposed causes for these disparities include increased rate of vascular risk factors that disproportionally affect some minority groups, differential effect of hypertension on stroke risk across racial groups, lack of access to health care and other social determinants of health, suboptimal control of risk factors, and although lacking substantive data to date, an inherited predisposition to stroke associated with genetic differences. The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) investigators found that the rate of suboptimal control of vascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles were significantly greater in African Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW).(2) Moreover, regarding high blood pressure (BP), a triple threat has been described: blacks are not only more likely to have high BP, they are less likely, once diagnosed, to have their high BP controlled, and this suboptimal control has been shown to confer a stroke risk that is 3 times higher among blacks compared to whites for every 10-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (SBP).(3.)", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Health Surveys", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Life Style", "Male", "Mexican Americans", "Middle Aged", "Risk", "Stroke", "United States", "White People", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Olajide A", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2014Mar25"}, {"PMID": "24481976", "Title": "Effect of a novel video game on stroke knowledge of 9- to 10-year-old, low-income children.", "Abstract": "Improving actionable stroke knowledge of a witness or bystander, which in some cases are children, may improve response to an acute stroke event.", "Keywords": ["health education", "healthcare disparities", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Child", "Female", "Health Education", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Intracranial Hemorrhages", "Male", "New York City", "Poverty", "Stroke", "Video Games"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Olajide", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology, The Neurological Institute of New York, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mindy F", "Last Name": "Hecht", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra L", "Last Name": "DeSorbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saima", "Last Name": "Huq", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}]
