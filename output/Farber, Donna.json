[{"PMID": "38905110", "Title": "Distinct Localization, Transcriptional Profiles, and Functionality in Early Life Tonsil Regulatory T Cells.", "Abstract": "CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key orchestrators of the immune system, fostering the establishment of protective immunity while preventing deleterious responses. Infancy and childhood are crucial periods of rapid immunologic development, but how Tregs mediate immune responses at these earliest timepoints of human life is poorly understood. In this study, we compare blood and tissue (tonsil) Tregs across pediatric and adult subjects to investigate age-related differences in Treg biology. We observed increased FOXP3 expression and proportions of Tregs in tonsil compared with paired blood samples in children. Within tonsil, early life Tregs accumulated in extrafollicular regions with cellular interactions biased toward CD8+ T cells. Tonsil Tregs in both children and adults expressed transcriptional profiles enriched for lineage defining signatures and canonical functionality compared with blood, suggesting tissue as the primary site of Treg activity. Early life tonsil Tregs transcriptional profiles were further defined by pathways associated with activation, proliferation, and polyfunctionality. Observed differences in pediatric tonsil Treg transcriptional signatures were associated with phenotypic differences, high proliferative capacity, and robust production of IL-10 compared with adult Tregs. These results identify tissue as a major driver of Treg identity, provide new insights into developmental differences in Treg biology across the human lifespan, and demonstrate unique functional properties of early life Tregs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shivali", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marissa C", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Pranay", "Last Name": "Dogra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel P", "Last Name": "Caron", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Maurrasse", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Eli", "Last Name": "Grunstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Waldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Minyoung", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kalpana", "Last Name": "Pethe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2024Jun21"}, {"PMID": "38848342", "Title": "Human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in diverse tissues exhibit site-specific maturation dynamics across the life span.", "Abstract": "During ontogeny, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells emerge from the thymus and directly seed peripheral tissues for in situ immunity.

Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults.

The mechanisms by which infants and young children mount effective immune responses to respiratory pathogens are unknown. Through investigation of lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes from infant and pediatric organ donors aged 0-13 years, we show that bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), containing B cell follicles, CD4+ T cells and functionally active germinal centers, develop during infancy. BALT structures are prevalent around lung airways during the first 3 years of life, and their numbers decline through childhood coincident with the accumulation of memory T cells. Single-cell profiling and repertoire analysis reveals that early life lung B cells undergo differentiation, somatic hypermutation and immunoglobulin class switching and exhibit a more activated profile than lymph node B cells. Moreover, B cells in the lung and lung-associated lymph nodes generate biased antibody responses to multiple respiratory pathogens compared to circulating antibodies, which are mostly specific for vaccine antigens in the early years of life.

While immunotherapies have been beneficial with many different types of solid tumors, they have almost uniformly failed in the treatment of PDAC. Understanding how therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can provide insights for the development of strategies to treat PDAC. We used quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescence (qmIF) quantitative spatial analysis (qSA), and immunogenomic (IG) analysis to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 44 patients with PDAC including 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and 26 patients receiving no treatment (NT) and compared them with tissues from 40 treatment-na\u00efve melanoma patients. We find that relative to NT tumors, CD3+ T cell infiltration was increased in CRT treated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0006), including increases in CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs, p =\u00a0.0079), CD3+CD4+FOXP3- T helper cells (Th, p =\u00a0.0010), and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs, p =\u00a0.0089) with no difference in CD68+ macrophages. IG analysis from micro-dissected tissues indicated overexpression of genes involved in antigen presentation, T cell activation, and inflammation in CRT treated tumors. Among treated patients, a higher ratio of Tregs to total T cells was associated with shorter survival time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0121). Despite comparable levels of infiltrating T cells in CRT PDACs to melanoma, PDACs displayed distinct spatial profiles with less T cell clustering as defined by nearest neighbor analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These findings demonstrate that, while CRT can achieve high T cell densities in PDAC compared to melanoma, phenotype and spatial organization of T cells may limit benefit of T cell infiltration in this immunotherapy-resistant tumor.", "Keywords": ["T regulatory cells", "Tumor microenvironment", "biomarkers", "tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Gartrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Enzler", "Affiliation": "Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ladan", "Last Name": "Fazlollahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew X", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanna E", "Last Name": "Minns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Subha", "Last Name": "Perni", "Affiliation": "Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart P", "Last Name": "Weisberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuelle M", "Last Name": "Rizk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eun Jeong", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinzheng V", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Codruta", "Last Name": "Chiuzan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Bates", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chabot", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Schrope", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kluger", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabad\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Remotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne M", "Last Name": "Saenger", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35446789", "Title": "Immune and epithelial determinants of age-related risk and alveolar injury in fatal COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is characterized by widespread disruption of the lung's alveolar gas exchange interface.

We found marked loss of type 2 alveolar epithelial (T2AE) cells and increased perialveolar lymphocyte cytotoxicity in all fatal COVID-19 cases, even at early stages before typical patterns of acute lung injury are histologically apparent. In lungs from uninfected organ donors, there was also progressive loss of T2AE cells with increasing age, which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19-mediated lung damage in older individuals. In the fatal COVID-19 cases, macrophage infiltration differed according to the histopathological pattern of lung injury. In cases with acute lung injury, we found accumulation of CD4+ macrophages that expressed distinctly high levels of T cell activation and costimulation genes and strongly correlated with increased extent of alveolar epithelial cell depletion and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.

Acute cardiac dysfunction and resultant cardiogenic shock are common in children with MIS-C. While most children recover rapidly from acute illness, the long-term impact on the myocardium and cardiac function is unknown. Methods In this prospective study, cardiac MRI (CMR) was performed on patients <21 years of age with a history of MIS-C, 6-9 months following hospitalization. Per institutional protocol, patients with any history of LVEF<50%, persistent cardiorespiratory symptoms, or ECG abnormalities underwent clinical CMR. Research CMRs were offered to all others >10 years old. Native T1 and T2 mapping values were compared with 20 children with normal CMR examinations. Results We performed CMRs on 13 subjects at a median age of 13.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 11.9-16.0) and a median time from hospitalization of 8.2 months (IQR 6.8-9.6). Twelve subjects displayed normal ventricular function with a median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57.2% (IQR 56.1-58.4) and median right ventricular (RV) EF of 53.1% (IQR 52.0-55.7). One subject had low normal EF (52%). There was normal T2 and native T1 as compared to normal controls. There was qualitatively no evidence of edema by T2 weighted imaging. One subject had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at the inferior insertion point and mid-ventricular inferolateral region, with normal EF, no evidence of edema or perfusion defects, and normal T1 and T2 times. When stratifying by a history of abnormal LVEF (LVEF <55%) on echocardiography, there was no difference in or parametric mapping values, though LVEF and LVEDV approached significance (p=0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusions Although many children with MIS-C present acutely with cardiac dysfunction, myocardial recovery is overall excellent with minimal to no evidence of residual cardiac dysfunction or myocardial involvement. LVEF by CMR at 6-9 months among children with history of echocardiographic LV dysfunction is slightly lower, though does not meet statistical significance and is still within normal range.

Human pDCs produced high amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I) when incubated with live CMV-infected fibroblasts but not with free CMV; the response involved integrin-mediated adhesion, transfer of DNA-containing virions to pDCs, and the recognition of DNA through TLR9. Compared with transient polyfunctional responses to CpG or free influenza virus, pDC response to CMV-infected cells was long-lasting, dominated by the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, and lacked diversification into functionally distinct populations. Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control.

A subset of lung T cells can persist as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) following infection and allergen induction, although the generation and role of TRM in asthma persistence and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of chronic exposure to intranasal house dust mite (HDM) extract to dissect how lung TRMs are generated and function in the persistence and pathogenesis of allergic airway disease. We demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate into the lung tissue during acute HDM exposure; however, only CD4+ TRMs, and not CD8+ TRMs, persist long term following cessation of HDM administration.

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) produce type 2 cytokines, and although advances have been made in understanding the cytokine milieu that promotes ILC2 responses, how ILC2 responses are regulated by other stimuli remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that ILC2s in the mouse gastrointestinal tract co-localize with cholinergic neurons that express the neuropeptide neuromedin U (NMU). In contrast to other haematopoietic cells, ILC2s selectively express the NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1). In vitro stimulation of ILC2s with NMU induced rapid cell activation, proliferation, and secretion of the type 2 cytokines IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 that was dependent on cell-intrinsic expression of NMUR1 and G\u03b1q protein. In vivo administration of NMU triggered potent type 2 cytokine responses characterized by ILC2 activation, proliferation and eosinophil recruitment that was associated with accelerated expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or induction of lung inflammation. Conversely, worm burden was higher in Nmur1-/- mice than in control mice. Furthermore, use of gene-deficient mice and adoptive cell transfer experiments revealed that ILC2s were necessary and sufficient to mount NMU-elicited type 2 cytokine responses.

Many anesthetics potentiate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing \u03b14-subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR \u03b14-subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra40/0 ) mice. Wild-type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to PBS intranasally 5 days/wk for 3 wk. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (P = not significant; n = 4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (P < 0.05, n = 8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (P < 0.05; n = 4) and increased markers of lung T-cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; P < 0.01, n = 4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4+ cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T-cell receptor as compared with WT CD4+ cells.

Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections.

Stability does not appear to reflect replenishment from new infection events but rather normal physiologic processes that provide for immunologic memory. Of particular importance are proliferative processes that drive clonal expansion of infected cells.

T cells are integral to adaptive immunity; mouse studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both protective immunity and immunoregulation.

We present here an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ donors in the first two years of life, as compared to adult organ donors, revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation.

Emerging studies indicate that immune cells, including monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes, regulate metabolic homeostasis and are dysregulated in obesity. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) can regulate adaptive immunity and eosinophil and alternatively activated macrophage responses, and were recently identified in murine white adipose tissue (WAT) where they may act to limit the development of obesity. However, ILC2s have not been identified in human adipose tissue, and the mechanisms by which ILC2s regulate metabolic homeostasis remain unknown. Here we identify ILC2s in human WAT and demonstrate that decreased ILC2 responses in WAT are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice. Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in WAT and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure. This was associated with recruitment of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)(+) beige adipocytes in WAT, a process known as beiging or browning that regulates caloric expenditure. IL-33-induced beiging was dependent on ILC2s, and IL-33 treatment or transfer of IL-33-elicited ILC2s was sufficient to drive beiging independently of the adaptive immune system, eosinophils or IL-4 receptor signalling. We found that ILC2s produce methionine-enkephalin peptides that can act directly on adipocytes to upregulate Ucp1 expression in vitro and that promote beiging in vivo.

Using a spleen efferocytosis assay and targeted genetic deletion in mice, we identified a multiprotein complex--composed of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), and RAN-binding protein 9 (RANBP9)--that mediates DC efferocytosis and antigen cross-presentation. We found that AXL bound ACs, but required LRP-1 to trigger internalization, in murine CD8\u03b1+ DCs and human-derived DCs. AXL and LRP-1 did not interact directly, but relied on RANBP9, which bound both AXL and LRP-1, to form the complex. In a coculture model of antigen presentation, the AXL/LRP-1/RANBP9 complex was used by DCs to cross-present AC-associated antigens to T cells. Furthermore, in a murine model of herpes simplex virus-1 infection, mice lacking DC-specific LRP-1, AXL, or RANBP9 had increased AC accumulation, defective viral antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation, enhanced viral load, and decreased survival. The discovery of this multiprotein complex that mediates functionally important DC efferocytosis in vivo may have implications for future studies related to host defense and DC-based vaccines.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Apoptosis", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Coculture Techniques", "Cross-Priming", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Dendritic Cells", "Female", "Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2", "Herpesviridae Infections", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phagocytosis", "Protein Binding", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Receptors, LDL", "Receptors, Virus", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manikandan", "Last Name": "Subramanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Crystal D", "Last Name": "Hayes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph J", "Last Name": "Thome", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Thorp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Glenn K", "Last Name": "Matsushima", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joachim", "Last Name": "Herz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Madepalli", "Last Name": "Lakshmana", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24336101", "Title": "Human memory T cells: generation, compartmentalization and homeostasis.", "Abstract": "Memory T cells constitute the most abundant lymphocyte population in the body for the majority of a person's lifetime; however, our understanding of memory T cell generation, function and maintenance mainly derives from mouse studies, which cannot recapitulate the exposure to multiple pathogens that occurs over many decades in humans.

Previous studies linked pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-expressing HSCs, EMH, and immune responses to microbial stimuli. However, whether EMH operates in broader immune contexts remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in promoting the population expansion of progenitor cells in the periphery and identify that TSLP-elicited progenitors differentiated into effector cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes and that these cells contributed to type 2 cytokine responses. The frequency of circulating progenitor cells was also increased in allergic patients with a gain-of-function polymorphism in TSLP, suggesting the TSLP-EMH pathway might operate in human disease.

Previously, IAV-specific effector CD8 T cells found systemically during the course of IAV infection were thought to have been primed in lung-draining lymph nodes with subsequent migration to other tissues. However, little is known about whether other lymphoid sites participate in the generation of virus-specific CD8 T cells during localized IAV infection. Here, we present evidence of early CD8 T cell priming in the spleen following respiratory IAV infection independent of lung-draining lymph node priming of T cells. Although we found early indications of CD8 T cell activation in the lymph nodes draining the respiratory tract, we also saw evidence of virus-specific CD8 T cell activation in the spleen. Furthermore, CD8 T cells primed in the spleen differentiated into memory cells of equivalent longevity and with similar recall capacity as CD8 T cells primed in the draining lymph nodes.
