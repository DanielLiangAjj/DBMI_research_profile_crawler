The circuit underlying this property begins in the retina, from which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) extend to the same or opposite side of the brain. RGC axons decussate to form the optic chiasm, then grow to targets in the thalamus and midbrain, where they synapse with neurons that project to the visual cortex. Here we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms of RGC axonal growth cone guidance across or away from the midline via receptors to cues in the midline environment. We present new views on the specification of ipsi- and contralateral RGC subpopulations and factors implementing their organization in the optic tract and termination in subregions of their targets.

RGC repopulation is a promising therapeutic approach to reverse vision loss from optic neuropathies if the newly introduced neurons can reestablish functional retinal and thalamic circuits. In theory, RGCs might be repopulated through the transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons or via the induction of endogenous transdifferentiation. The RGC Repopulation, Stem Cell Transplantation, and Optic Nerve Regeneration (RReSTORe) Consortium was established to address the challenges associated with the therapeutic repair of the visual pathway in optic neuropathy. In 2022, the RReSTORe Consortium initiated ongoing international collaborative discussions to advance the RGC repopulation field and has identified five critical areas of focus: (1) RGC development and differentiation, (2) Transplantation methods and models, (3) RGC survival, maturation, and host interactions, (4) Inner retinal wiring, and (5) Eye-to-brain connectivity.

The ability of semaphorins to act both as signaling receptors and ligands yields a multitude of responses. Here, we describe a novel role for Semaphorin-6D (Sema6D) and Plexin-A1 in the positioning and targeting of retinogeniculate axons. In Plexin-A1 or Sema6D mutant mice of either sex, the optic tract courses through, rather than along, the border of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), and some retinal axons ectopically arborize adjacent and lateral to the optic tract rather than defasciculating and entering the target region. We find that Sema6D and Plexin-A1 act together in a dose-dependent manner, as the number of the ectopic retinal projections is altered in proportion to the level of Sema6D or Plexin-A1 expression. Moreover, using retinal in utero electroporation of Sema6D or Plexin-A1 shRNA, we show that Sema6D and Plexin-A1 are both required in retinal ganglion cells for axon positioning and targeting. Strikingly, nonelectroporated retinal ganglion cell axons also mistarget in the tract region, indicating that Sema6D and Plexin-A1 can act non-cell-autonomously, potentially through axon-axon interactions. These data provide novel evidence for a dose-dependent and non-cell-autonomous role for Sema6D and Plexin-A1 in retinal axon organization in the optic tract and dLGN.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Before innervating their central brain targets, retinal ganglion cell axons fasciculate in the optic tract and then branch and arborize in their target areas. Upon deletion of the guidance molecules Plexin-A1 or Semaphorin-6D, the optic tract becomes disorganized near and extends within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, some retinal axons form ectopic aggregates within the defasciculated tract. Sema6D and Plexin-A1 act together as a receptor-ligand pair in a dose-dependent manner, and non-cell-autonomously, to produce this developmental aberration. Such a phenotype highlights an underappreciated role for axon guidance molecules in tract cohesion and appropriate defasciculation near, and arborization within, targets.", "Keywords": ["axon guidance", "development", "fasciculation", "retina", "semaphorin", "visual system"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Axons", "Ligands", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Semaphorins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Delphine S", "Last Name": "Prieur", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche-S 839, Paris, 75005, France."}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9dric", "Last Name": "Francius", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche-S 839, Paris, 75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Gaspar", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche-S 839, Paris, 75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Carol A", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Neuroscience, and Ophthalmology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Rebsam", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche-S 839, Paris, 75005, France alexandra.rebsam@inserm.fr."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023Aug09"}, {"PMID": "36351424", "Title": "CyclinD2-mediated regulation of neurogenic output from the retinal ciliary margin is perturbed in albinism.", "Abstract": "In albinism, aberrations in the ipsi-/contralateral retinal ganglion cell (RGC) ratio compromise the functional integrity of the binocular circuit.

We found that the mouse ventral CMZ generates predominantly ipsilaterally projecting RGCs, but this output is altered in the albino visual system because of CyclinD2 downregulation and disturbed timing of the cell cycle. Consequently, albino as well as CyclinD2-deficient pigmented mice exhibit diminished ipsilateral retinogeniculate projection and poor depth perception. In albino mice, pharmacological stimulation of calcium channels, known to upregulate CyclinD2 in other cell types, augmented CyclinD2-dependent neurogenesis of ipsilateral RGCs and improved stereopsis.

To further understand the molecular link between disrupted RPE and a reduced ipsilateral RGC projection in albinism, we compared gene expression in the embryonic albino and pigmented mouse RPE. We found that the Wnt pathway, which directs peripheral retinal differentiation and, generally, cell proliferation, is dysregulated in the albino RPE.

To parse whether these two populations also differ in the timing of their genesis, a feature of distinct neural subtypes and associated projections, we used newer birthdating methods and cell subtype specific markers to determine birthdate and cell cycle exit more precisely than previously. In the ventrotemporal (VT) retina, i- and cRGCs intermingle and neurogenesis in this zone lags behind RGC production in the rest of the retina where only cRGCs are positioned. In addition, within the VT retina, i- and cRGC populations are born at distinct times: neurogenesis of iRGCs surges at E13, and cRGCs arise as early as E14, not later in embryogenesis as reported. Moreover, in the ventral ciliary margin zone (CMZ), which contains progenitors that give rise to some iRGCs in ventral neural retina (Marcucci et al., 2016), cell cycle exit is slower than in other retinal regions in which progenitors give rise only to cRGCs. Further, when the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D2 is missing, cell cycle length in the CMZ is further reduced, mirroring the reduction of both i- and cRGCs in the Cyclin D2 mutant.

To identify potential cell-autonomous factors contributing to the segregation of ipsilateral and contralateral RGC axons in the visual pathway, we assessed their fasciculation behavior in a retinal explant assay. Ipsilateral RGC neurites self-fasciculate more than contralateral neurites in vitro and maintain this difference in the presence of extrinsic chiasm cues. To further probe the role of axon self-association in circuit formation in vivo, we examined RGC axon organization and fasciculation in an EphB1-/- mutant, in which a subset of ipsilateral RGC axons aberrantly crosses the midline but targets the ipsilateral zone in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus on the opposite side. Aberrantly crossing axons retain their association with ipsilateral axons in the contralateral tract, indicating that cohort-specific axon affinity is maintained independently of guidance signals present at the midline.

BCG, the only vaccine currently available, provides some protection against tuberculous meningitis in children but variable efficacy in adults, and is not safe to use in immune compromised individuals. A safe and effective vaccine that could be given early in life, and that could also potentiate subsequent booster immunization, would represent a significant advance. To test this proposition, we have generated gene-based vaccine vectors expressing Ag85B from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and designed experiments to test their immunogenicity and protective efficacy particularly when given in heterologous prime-boost combination, with the initial DNA vaccine component given soon after birth. Intradermal delivery of DNA vaccines elicited Th1-based immune responses against Ag85B in neonatal mice but did not protect them from subsequent aerosol challenge with virulent Mtb H37Rv. Recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding Ag85B, given via the intranasal route at six weeks of age, generated moderate immune responses and were poorly protective. However, neonatal DNA priming following by mucosal boosting with recombinant adenovirus generated strong immune responses, as evidenced by strong Ag85B-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, both in the lung-associated lymph nodes and the spleen, by the quality of these responding cells (assessed by their capacity to secrete multiple antimicrobial factors), and by improved protection, as indicated by reduced bacterial burden in the lungs following pulmonary TB challenge. These results suggest that neonatal immunization with gene-based vaccines may create a favorable immunological environment that potentiates the pulmonary mucosal boosting effects of a subsequent heterologous vector vaccine encoding the same antigen.

The Autophagy linked FYVE protein (Alfy), previously identified as a molecular scaffold between the ubiquitinated cargo and the autophagic machinery, is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, indicating that this pathway may have yet unexplored roles in neurodevelopment. To examine this possibility, we used mouse genetics to eliminate Alfy expression. We report that this evolutionarily conserved protein is required for the formation of axonal tracts throughout the brain and spinal cord, including the formation of the major forebrain commissures. Consistent with a phenotype reflecting a failure in axon guidance, the loss of Alfy in mice disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells, and attenuates axon outgrowth in response to Netrin-1.

Disruption of pigmentation in the albino RPE is associated with delayed neurogenesis in the ventrotemporal retina, the source of ipsilateral RGCs, and a reduced ipsilateral RGC projection. To begin to unravel how melanogenesis and the RPE regulate RGC neurogenesis and cell subpopulation specification, we compared the features of albino and pigmented mouse RPE cells during the period of RGC neurogenesis (embryonic day, E, 12.5 to 18.5) when the RPE is closely apposed to developing RGC precursors. At E12.5 and E15.5, although albino and pigmented RPE cells express RPE markers Otx2 and Mitf similarly, albino RPE cells are irregularly shaped and have fewer melanosomes compared with pigmented RPE cells. The adherens junction protein P-cadherin appears loosely distributed within the albino RPE cells rather than tightly localized on the cell membrane, as in pigmented RPE. Connexin 43 (gap junction protein) is expressed in pigmented and albino RPE cells at E13.5 but at E15.5 albino RPE cells have fewer small connexin 43 puncta, and a larger fraction of phosphorylated connexin 43 at serine 368. These results suggest that the lack of pigment in the RPE results in impaired RPE cell integrity and communication via gap junctions between RPE and neural retina during RGC neurogenesis. Our findings should pave the way for further investigation of the role of RPE in regulating RGC development toward achieving proper RGC axon decussation. J. Comp.

Most studies indicate that cell-mediated immune responses involving both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are necessary for effective immunity against Mtb. Genetic vaccination induces humoral and cellular immune responses, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, against a variety of bacterial, viral, parasitic and tumor antigens, and this strategy may therefore hold promise for the development of more effective TB vaccines. Novel formulations and delivery strategies to improve the immunogenicity of DNA-based vaccines have recently been evaluated, and have shown varying degrees of success. In the present study, we evaluated DNA-launched Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons (Vrep) encoding a novel fusion of the mycobacterial antigens \u03b1-crystallin (Acr) and antigen 85B (Ag85B), termed Vrep-Acr/Ag85B, for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a murine model of pulmonary TB. Vrep-Acr/Ag85B generated antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that persisted for at least 10 wk post-immunization. Interestingly, parenterally administered Vrep-Acr/Ag85B also induced T cell responses in the lung tissues, the primary site of infection, and inhibited bacterial growth in both the lungs and spleens following aerosol challenge with Mtb. DNA-launched Vrep may, therefore, represent an effective approach to the development of gene-based vaccines against TB, particularly as components of heterologous prime-boost strategies or as BCG boosters.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acyltransferases", "Animals", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Encephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine", "Immunity, Cellular", "Immunity, Humoral", "Mice", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Replicon", "Tuberculosis Vaccines", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary", "Vaccination", "alpha-Crystallins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neha", "Last Name": "Dalmia", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "William B", "Last Name": "Klimstra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Carol", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alistair J", "Last Name": "Ramsay", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25998323", "Title": "Adverse events of local treatment in long-term head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma survivors after external beam radiotherapy or AMORE treatment.", "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is a well-known cause of adverse events (AEs).

We have followed the course of this transient early ipsilateral cohort of RGCs, paying attention to how far they extend, whether they enter targets and if so, which ones, and the time course of their disappearance. The DC ipsilateral RGC axons were traced using DiI labeling at E13.5 and E15.5 to compare the proportion of ipsi- versus contralateral projections during the first period of growth. In utero electroporation of E12.5 retina with GFP constructs was used to label axons that could be visualized at succeeding time points into postnatal ages. Our results show that the earliest ipsilateral axons grow along the cellular border of the brain, and are segregated from the laterally positioned contralateral axons from the same retinal origin. In agreement with previous reports, although many early RGCs extend ipsilaterally, after E16 their number rapidly declines. Nonetheless, some ipsilateral axons from the DC retina enter the superior colliculus and arborize minimally, but very few enter the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and those that do extend only short branches.

We conclude that thalamic effectiveness does not rely on enhanced TC strength, but rather on coincident activation of converging inputs.", "Keywords": ["compartmental", "confocal", "dendrite", "in vivo", "optogenetics", "synapse"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Dendrites", "Dendritic Spines", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Pathways", "Neurons", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Thalamus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carl E", "Last Name": "Schoonover", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Juan-Carlos", "Last Name": "Tapia", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Verena C", "Last Name": "Schilling", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Verena", "Last Name": "Wimmer", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville VIC 3010, Australia, and."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Blazeski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wanying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carol A", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Randy M", "Last Name": "Bruno", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, randybruno@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014May14"}, {"PMID": "23526936", "Title": "L-Dopa and the albino riddle: content of L-Dopa in the developing retina of pigmented and albino mice.", "Abstract": "The absence or deficiency of melanin as in albinos, has detrimental effects on retinal development that include aberrant axonal projections from eye to brain and impaired vision.
