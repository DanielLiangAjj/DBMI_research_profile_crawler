This equilibrium is governed by the light-absorbing 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore of visual pigments, which, upon bleaching, transforms into all-trans-retinal and undergoes regeneration through an enzymatic pathway, named the visual cycle. Chemical side reactions of retinaldehyde during the recycling process can generate by-products that may result in a depletion of retinoids. In our study, we have clarified the crucial roles played by melanin pigmentation and the retinoid transporter STRA6 in preventing this loss and preserving the integrity of the visual cycle. Our experiments initially confirmed that consecutive green and blue light bleaching of isolated bovine rhodopsin produced 9-cis and 13-cis retinal. The same unusual retinoids were found in the retinas of mice exposed to intense light, with elevated concentrations observed in albino mice. Examining the metabolic fate of these visual cycle byproducts revealed that 9-cis-retinal, but not 13-cis-retinal, was recycled back to all-trans-retinal through an intermediate called isorhodopsin. However, investigations in Stra6 knockout mice unveiled that the generation of these visual cycle byproducts correlated with a light-induced loss of ocular retinoids and visual impairment.

Vitamin A aldehyde is sequestered by reversible Schiff base formation with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and subsequently undergoes NADPH-dependent reduction. Otherwise inefficient handling of retinaldehyde can lead to the formation of fluorescent di-retinal compounds within the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. These bisretinoid fluorophores initiate photooxidative processes having adverse consequences for retina. Various carrier proteins confer water solubility and maintain the 11-cis-retinoid configuration. Mechanisms for sequestration of retinoid include the formation of a reversible Schiff base between retinaldehyde and taurine (A1-taurine, A1T), the most abundant amino acid in photoreceptor cells. Here we have undertaken to examine the effects of taurine depletion using the transport inhibitors guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) and \u03b2-alanine. Oral treatment of BALB/cJ mice with \u03b2-alanine reduced ocular A1T and the mice exhibited significantly lower scotopic and photopic a-wave amplitudes. As a secondary effect of retinal degeneration, A1T was not detected and taurine was significantly reduced in mice carrying a P23H opsin mutation. The thinning of ONL that is indicative of reduced photoreceptor cell viability in albino Abca4-/- mice was more pronounced in \u03b2-alanine treated mice. Treatment of agouti and albino Abca4-/- mice with \u03b2-alanine and GES was associated with reduced bisretinoid measured chromatographically. Consistent with a reduction in carbonyl scavenging activity by taurine, methylglyoxal-adducts were also increased in the presence of \u03b2-alanine. Taken together these findings support the postulate that A1T serves as a reservoir of vitamin A aldehyde, with diminished A1T explaining reduced photoreceptor light-sensitivity, accentuated ONL thinning in Abca4-/- mice and attenuated bisretinoid formation.", "Keywords": ["Bisretinoids", "Retina", "Retinaldehyde", "Taurine", "Vitamin A"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Animals", "Mice", "Opsins", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Retina", "Retinaldehyde", "Retinoids", "Schiff Bases", "Taurine", "beta-Alanine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hye Jin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA; Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA.

Herein, we extend this work, finding surprising chronic features of the model: geographic atrophy and sympathetic ophthalmia. We provide new mechanistic insights derived from focal AF in the photoreceptors, quantification of bisretinoids, and localization of carboxyethyl pyrrole, an oxidized adduct of docosahexaenoic acid associated with AMD. In mice given IVT ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), RPE died in patches that slowly expanded at their borders, like human geographic atrophy. There was green AF in the photoreceptor ellipsoid, a mitochondria-rich region, 4\u00a0h after injection, followed later by gold AF in rod outer segments, RPE and subretinal myeloid cells. The green AF signature is consistent with flavin adenine dinucleotide, while measured increases in the bisretinoid all-trans-retinal dimer are consistent with the gold AF. FAC induced formation carboxyethyl pyrrole accumulation first in photoreceptors, then in RPE and myeloid cells. Quantitative PCR on neural retina and RPE indicated antioxidant upregulation and inflammation. Unexpectedly, reminiscent of sympathetic ophthalmia, autofluorescent myeloid cells containing abundant iron infiltrated the saline-injected fellow eyes only if the contralateral eye had received IVT FAC. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the potential toxicity caused by AMD-associated retinal iron accumulation.

We hypothesize that increasing dietary intake of the macular carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin in individuals at risk of AMD and STGD1 can inhibit the formation of bisretinoids A2E and iso-A2E, which can potentially ameliorate macular degenerative diseases. To study the beneficial effect of macular carotenoids in a retinal degenerative diseases model, we used ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 4 (Abca4-/-)/\u03b2,\u03b2-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase 2 (Bco2-/-) double knockout (KO) mice that accumulate elevated levels of A2E and iso-A2E in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and macular carotenoids in the retina. Abca4-/-/Bco2-/- and Abca4-/- mice were fed a lutein-supplemented chow, zeaxanthin-supplemented chow or placebo chow (~2.6\u00a0mg of carotenoid/mouse/day) for three months. Visual function and electroretinography (ERG) were measured after one month and three months of carotenoid supplementation. The lutein and zeaxanthin supplemented Abca4-/-/Bco2-/- mice had significantly lower levels of RPE/choroid A2E and iso-A2E compared to control mice fed with placebo chow and improved visual performance. Carotenoid supplementation in Abca4-/- mice minimally raised retinal carotenoid levels and did not show much difference in bisretinoid levels or visual function compared to the control diet group. There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between carotenoid levels in the retina and A2E and iso-A2E levels in the RPE/choroid. Supplementation with retinal carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin, effectively inhibits bisretinoid formation in a mouse model of STGD1 genetically enhanced to accumulate carotenoids in the retina.

We previously showed that iron can promote the oxidation of bisretinoid by generating highly reactive hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH). Now we report that preservation of iron regulation in the retina is not sufficient to prevent iron-induced bisretinoid oxidative degradation when blood iron levels are elevated in liver-specific hepcidin knockout mice. We obtained evidence for the perpetuation of Fenton reactions in the presence of the bisretinoid A2E and visible light. On the other hand, iron chelation by deferiprone was not associated with changes in postbleaching recovery of 11-cis-retinal or dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes indicating that the activity of Rpe65, a rate-determining visual cycle protein that carries an iron-binding domain, is not affected. Notably, iron levels were elevated in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of Abca4-/- mice.

aldehyde-taurine adduct and the visual cycle.", "Abstract": "Visual pigment consists of opsin covalently linked to the vitamin A-derived chromophore, 11-cis-retinaldehyde. Photon absorption causes the chromophore to isomerize from the 11-cis- to all-trans-retinal configuration. Continued light sensitivity necessitates the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal via a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps within the visual cycle. During this process, vitamin A aldehyde is shepherded within photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells to facilitate retinoid trafficking, to prevent nonspecific reactivity, and to conserve the 11-cis configuration. Here we show that redundancy in this system is provided by a protonated Schiff base adduct of retinaldehyde and taurine (A1-taurine, A1T) that forms reversibly by nonenzymatic reaction. A1T was present as 9-cis, 11-cis, 13-cis, and all-trans isomers, and the total levels were higher in neural retina than in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). A1T was also more abundant under conditions in which 11-cis-retinaldehyde was higher; this included black versus albino mice, dark-adapted versus light-adapted mice, and mice carrying the Rpe65-Leu450 versus Rpe65-450Met variant. Taurine levels paralleled these differences in A1T. Moreover, A1T was substantially reduced in mice deficient in the Rpe65 isomerase and in mice deficient in cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; in these models the production of 11-cis-retinal is compromised. A1T is an amphiphilic small molecule that may represent a mechanism for escorting retinaldehyde. The transient Schiff base conjugate that the primary amine of taurine forms with retinaldehyde would readily hydrolyze to release the retinoid and thus may embody a pool of 11-cis-retinal that can be marshalled in photoreceptor cells.", "Keywords": ["photoreceptor cells", "retinal pigment epithelium", "taurine", "visual cycle", "vitamin A"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Isomerism", "Light", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Retina", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Retinaldehyde", "Retinoids", "Taurine", "cis-trans-Isomerases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hye Jin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; jrs88@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2020Oct06"}, {"PMID": "32927963", "Title": "A mutation in CRX causing pigmented paravenous retinochoroidal atrophy.", "Abstract": "Mutations in the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) gene, a known cause of inherited retinal dystrophy, are characterized by extensive phenotypic heterogeneity.

With the advent of gene therapy and the numerous ongoing clinical trials for inherited retinal degenerations, quantifiable and reliable outcome measurements continually need to be identified. In this retrospective analysis, normalized and non-normalized short-wavelength (SW-AF) and near-infrared (NIR-AF) autofluorescence images of ten patients with mutations in visual cycle (VC) genes and nineteen patients with mutations in phototransduction (PT) genes were analyzed. Normalized SW-AF and NIR-AF images appeared darker in all patients with mutations in the VC as compared to patients with mutations in PT despite the use of significantly higher detector settings for image acquisition in the former group.

Following absorption of a photon, the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of visual pigment in photoreceptor cells isomerizes to all-trans-retinal. To maintain photosensitivity 11-cis-retinal must be replaced. At the same time, however, all-trans-retinal has to be handled so as to prevent nonspecific aldehyde activity. Some molecules of retinaldehyde upon release from opsin are efficiently reduced to retinol. Other molecules are released into the lipid phase of the disc membrane where they form a conjugate [N-retinylidene-PE (NRPE)] through a Schiff base linkage with PE. The reversible formation of NRPE serves as a transient sink for retinaldehyde that is intended to return retinaldehyde to the visual cycle. However, if instead of hydrolyzing to PE and retinaldehyde, NRPE reacts with a second molecule of retinaldehyde, a synthetic pathway is initiated that leads to the formation of multiple species of unwanted bisretinoid fluorophores. We report on recently identified members of the bisretinoid family, some of which differ with respect to the acyl chains associated with the glycerol backbone.

In short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW-AF) images, speckled hyperautofluorescence and mottling indicated macular involvement. In both the affected individuals and their asymptomatic carrier parents, reduced SW-AF intensities, measured as quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF), indicated chronic impairment in 11-cis-retinal availability and provided information on mutation severity. Hypertransmission of the SD-OCT signal into the choroid together with decreased near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) provided evidence for retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) involvement. In Rlbp1/Cralbp-/- mice, reduced 11-cis-retinal levels, qAF and NIR-AF intensities, and photoreceptor loss were consistent with the clinical presentation of the affected siblings.

The spectral features, cellular origin and topographic distribution of the natural autofluorescence of the fundus indicate that it is emitted from retinaldehyde-adducts that form in photoreceptor cells and accumulate, under most conditions, in retinal pigment epithelial cells. The distributions and intensities of fundus autofluorescence deviate from normal in many retinal disorders and it is widely recognized that these changing patterns can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal disease. The standardized protocol employed by qAF involves the normalization of fundus grey levels to a fluorescent reference installed in the imaging instrument.

To further delineate BEST1-associated pathology in vivo and to provide an animal model useful to explore experimental treatment efficacies, we have generated a knock-in mouse line (Best1Y227N). Heterozygous and homozygous mutants revealed no significant ocular abnormalities up to 2\u2005years of age. In contrast, knock-in animals demonstrated a severe phenotype in the male reproductive tract. In heterozygous Best1Y227N males, Best1 protein was significantly reduced in testis and almost absent in homozygous mutant mice, although mRNA transcription of wild-type and knock-in allele is present and similar in quantity. Degradation of mutant Best1 protein in testis was associated with adverse effects on sperm motility and the capability to fertilize eggs.

The mammalian retina relies on heterophagy and selective autophagy to efficiently degrade and metabolize ingested lipids with disruption in autophagy associated degradation contributing to age related retinal disorders. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) supports photoreceptor cell renewal by daily phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (OS). The daily ingestion of these lipid-rich OS imposes a constant degradative burden on these terminally differentiated cells. These cells rely on Microtubule-Associated Protein 1 Light Chain 3 (LC3) family of proteins for phagocytic clearance of the ingested OS. The LC3 family comprises of three highly homologous members, MAP1LC3A (LC3A), MAP1LC3B (LC3B), and MAP1LC3C (LC3C). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the LC3B isoform plays a specific role in maintaining RPE lipid homeostasis. We examined the RPE and retina of the LC3B -/- mouse as a function of age using in vivo ocular imaging and electroretinography coupled with ex vivo, lipidomic analyses of lipid mediators, assessment of bisretinoids as well as imaging of lipid aggregates. Deletion of LC3B resulted in defects within the RPE including increased phagosome accumulation, decreased fatty acid oxidation and a subsequent increase in RPE and sub-RPE lipid deposits. Age-dependent RPE changes included elevated levels of oxidized cholesterol, deposition of 4-HNE lipid peroxidation products, bisretinoid lipofuscin accumulation, and subretinal migration of microglia, collectively likely contributing to loss of retinal function. These observations are consistent with a critical role for LC3B-dependent processes in the maintenance of normal lipid homeostasis in the aging RPE, and suggest that LC3 isoform specific disruption in autophagic processes contribute to AMD-like pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)", "lipid metabolism", "mouse model", "oxidative stress", "retinal pigment epithelium"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anuradha", "Last Name": "Dhingra", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brent A", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Scheie Eye Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Neal S", "Last Name": "Peachey", "Affiliation": "Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lauren L", "Last Name": "Daniele", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Reyes-Reveles", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rachel C", "Last Name": "Sharp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bokkyoo", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Center of Excellence, School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas G", "Last Name": "Bazan", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Center of Excellence, School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hye Jin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nancy J", "Last Name": "Philp", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen", "Last Name": "Boesze-Battaglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30231179", "Title": "Light Come Shining: Fundus Autofluorescence.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fluorescein Angiography", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus", "PubDate": "2018Sep20"}, {"PMID": "30053465", "Title": "Quantitative Comparison of Near-infrared Versus Short-wave Autofluorescence Imaging in Monitoring Progression of Retinitis Pigmentosa.", "Abstract": "To quantitatively compare near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) and short-wave autofluorescence (SW-AF) as imaging modalities used to monitor retinitis pigmentosa (RP) disease progression, measured as a function of hyperautofluorescent ring constriction over time.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Coloring Agents", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Indocyanine Green", "Infrared Rays", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Optical Imaging", "Radio Waves", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruben", "Last Name": "Jauregui", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA;

This structural assignment was based on molecular mass (m/z 998), UV-visible absorbance maxima (340 and 440 nm), and retention time (73 min) and was corroborated by biomimetic synthesis using all-trans-retinal and glycerophosphoethanolamine analogs as starting materials. UPLC profiles of ocular extracts acquired from human donor eyes revealed that alkyl ether lysoA2PE was detectable in RPE, but not neural retina. LysoA2PE FLR spectra exhibited a significant hyperchromic shift in hydrophobic environments. The propensity for lysoA2PE to undergo photooxidation/degradation was less pronounced than A2E.

This SLOS rat model undergoes progressive and irreversible degeneration of the neural retina, with associated pathological features of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Here, we provide further insights into the mechanism involved in the RPE pathology. In the SLOS rat model, markedly increased RPE apical autofluorescence is observed, compared to untreated animals, which correlates with increased levels of A2E and other bisretinoids. Utilizing cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived SLOS RPE cells, we found significantly elevated steady-state levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and decreased cholesterol levels (key biochemical hallmarks of SLOS). Western blot analysis revealed altered levels of the macroautophagy/autophagy markers MAP1LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62, and build-up of ubiquitinated proteins. Accumulation of immature autophagosomes was accompanied by inefficient degradation of phagocytized, exogenously supplied retinal rod outer segments (as evidenced by persistence of the C-terminal 1D4 epitope of RHO [rhodopsin]) in SLOS RPE compared to iPSC-derived normal human control. SLOS RPE cells exhibited lysosomal pH levels and CTSD activity within normal physiological limits, thus discounting the involvement of perturbed lysosomal function. Furthermore, 1D4-positive phagosomes that accumulated in the RPE in both pharmacological and genetic rodent models of SLOS failed to fuse with lysosomes.

The short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) of fundus flecks in recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) suggests a connection to these fluorophores. Through multimodal imaging, we sought to elucidate this link. Flecks observed in SW-AF images often colocalized with foci exhibiting reduced or absent near-infrared autofluorescence signal, the source of which is melanin in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. With serial imaging, changes in near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) preceded the onset of fleck hyperautofluorescence in SW-AF images and fleck profiles in NIR-AF images tended to be larger. Flecks in SW-AF and NIR-AF images also corresponded to hyperreflective lesions traversing photoreceptor-attributable bands in horizontal SD-OCT scans. The hyperreflective lesions interrupted adjacent OCT reflectivity bands and were associated with thinning of the outer nuclear layer. These SD-OCT findings are attributable to photoreceptor cell degeneration. Progressive increases and decreases in the SW-AF intensity of flecks were evident in color-coded quantitative fundus autofluorescence maps. In some cases, flecks appeared to spread radially from the fovea to approximately 8\u00b0 of eccentricity, beyond which a circumferential spread characterized the distribution. Since the NIR-AF signal is derived from melanin and loss of this autofluorescence is indicative of RPE atrophy, the SW-AF of flecks cannot be accounted for by bisretinoid lipofuscin in RPE. Instead, we suggest that the bisretinoid serving as the source of the SW-AF signal, resides in photoreceptors, the cell that is also the site of bisretinoid synthesis.", "Keywords": ["ABCA4", "SD-OCT", "bisretinoid", "fundus autofluorescence", "recessive Stargardt disease", "retinal pigment epithelium", "spectral domain optical coherence tomography"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Lipofuscin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Optical Imaging", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Stargardt Disease", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Zinc Phosphate Cement"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maarjaliis", "Last Name": "Paavo", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neuroscience research", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "29686088", "Title": "Iron promotes oxidative cell death caused by bisretinoids of retina.", "Abstract": "Intracellular Fe plays a key role in redox active energy and electron transfer. We sought to understand how Fe levels impact the retina, given that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are also challenged by accumulations of vitamin A aldehyde adducts (bisretinoid lipofuscin) that photogenerate reactive oxygen species and photodecompose into damaging aldehyde- and dicarbonyl-bearing species. In mice treated with the Fe chelator deferiprone (DFP), intracellular Fe levels, as reflected in transferrin receptor mRNA expression, were reduced. DFP-treated albino Abca4-/- and agouti wild-type mice exhibited elevated bisretinoid levels as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography or noninvasively by quantitative fundus autofluorescence. Thinning of the outer nuclear layer, a parameter indicative of the loss of photoreceptor cell viability, was also reduced in DFP-treated albino Abca4-/- In contrast to the effects of the Fe chelator, mice burdened with increased intracellular Fe in RPE due to deficiency in the Fe export proteins hephaestin and ceruloplasmin, presented with reduced bisretinoid levels. These findings indicate that intracellular Fe promotes bisretinoid oxidation and degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments showing that DFP decreased the oxidative/degradation of the bisretinoid A2E in the presence of light and reduced cell death in cell-based experiments.

There was a tendency for Usher syndrome patients to have a higher distribution of severe mutations, and alleles in this group had a higher odds of containing nonsense or frame-shift mutations.

fluorophores are implicated in the pathogenesis of inherited and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here we demonstrate that bisretinoid photodegradation is ongoing in the eye. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of eyes of dark-reared and cyclic light-reared wild-type mice, together with comparisons of pigmented versus albino mice, revealed a relationship between intraocular light and reduced levels of the bisretinoids A2E and A2-glycero-phosphoethanolamine (A2-GPE). Analysis of the bisretinoids A2E, A2-GPE, A2-dihydropyridine-phosphatidylethanolamine (A2-DHP-PE), and all-trans-retinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine (all-trans-retinal dimer-PE) also decreases in albino Abca4(-/-) mice reared in cyclic light compared with darkness. In albino Abca4(-/-) mice receiving a diet supplemented with the antioxidant vitamin E, higher levels of RPE bisretinoid were evidenced by HPLC analysis and quantitation of fundus autofluorescence; this effect is consistent with photooxidative processes known to precede bisretinoid degradation. Amelioration of outer nuclear layer thinning indicated that vitamin E treatment protected photoreceptor cells. Conversely, in-cage exposure to short-wavelength light resulted in reduced fundus autofluorescence, decreased HPLC-quantified A2E, outer nuclear layer thinning, and increased methylglyoxal (MG)-adducted protein. MG was also released upon bisretinoid photodegradation in cells. We suggest that the lower levels of these diretinal adducts in cyclic light-reared and albino mice reflect photodegradative loss of bisretinoid.

Because bisretinoid constituents of the lipofuscin of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are known to photodegrade to mixtures of aldehyde-bearing fragments and small dicarbonyls (glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MG)), we investigated RPE lipofuscin as a source of the reactive species that covalently modify protein side chains. Abca4(-/-) and Rdh8(-/-)/Abca4(-/-) mice that are models of accelerated bisretinoid formation were studied and pre-exposure of mice to 430 nm light enriched for dicarbonyl release by bisretinoid photodegradation. MG protein adducts were elevated in posterior eyecups of mutant mice, whereas carbonylation of an RPE-specific protein was observed in Abca4(-/-) but not in wild-type mice under the same conditions. Immunolabeling of cryostat-sectioned eyes harvested from Abca4(-/-) mice revealed that carbonyl adduct deposition in Bruch's membrane was accentuated. Cell-based assays corroborated these findings in mice. Moreover, the receptor for advanced glycation end products that recognizes MG and GO adducts and glyoxylase 1 that metabolizes MG and GO were up-regulated in Abca4(-/-) mice. Additionally, in acellular assays, peptides were cross-linked in the presence of A2E (adduct of two vitamin A aldehyde and ethanolamine) photodegradation products, and in a zymography assay, reaction of collagen IV with products of A2E photodegradation resulted in reduced cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9. In conclusion, these mechanistic studies demonstrate a link between the photodegradation of RPE bisretinoid fluorophores and aging changes in underlying Bruch's membrane that can confer risk of age-related macular degeneration.", "Keywords": ["aging", "basement membrane", "bisretinoid", "dicarbonyl", "eye", "lipofuscin", "photodegradation", "retina", "retinal degeneration", "retinal pigment epithelium"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Aging", "Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Animals", "Bruch Membrane", "Cell Line", "Glycation End Products, Advanced", "Glyoxal", "Humans", "Lipofuscin", "Macular Degeneration", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Photolysis", "Protein Carbonylation", "Pyruvaldehyde", "Retina", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Retinoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jilin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Keiko", "Last Name": "Ueda", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Departments of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032; Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032.

Bisretinoid fluorophores isolated from retinal pigment epithelial cells have the spectral characteristics consistent with their being the source of fundus autofluorescence. Clinically relevant experiments were designed to better understand conditions in the micromilieu of bisretinoid fluorophores that can influence fluorescence efficiencies, photobleaching, and subsequent fluorescence recovery of this fluorophore. The consumption of the bisretinoid A2E due to photooxidation-induced degradation was quantified in solvent systems of variable relative permittivity (formerly called dielectric constant), in micelles, and in phospholipid vesicles of varying composition. Reorganization within biphasic systems was also examined. A2E content was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence intensity was quantified spectroscopically. As solvent polarity was increased, A2E fluorescent spectra exhibited red-shifted maxima and reduced intensity. A2E was depleted by light irradiation and the loss was more pronounced in less polar solvents, lower concentrations of anionic surfactant, and in gel- versus fluid-ordered phospholipid liposomes. Conditions that permit A2E aggregation promoted photooxidation/photodegradation, while movement of A2E between bisphasic systems was associated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The fluorescence characteristics of A2E are subject to environmental modulation. Photooxidation and photodegradation of bisretinoid can account for fundus autofluorescence photobleaching. Return of fluorescence intensity after photobleaching likely occurs due to redistribution of A2E fractions amongst co-existing heterogeneous microdomains of the lysosomal compartment.", "Keywords":

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 9 million older Americans, and is characterized by the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the closely linked genome-wide association studies ARMS2/HTRA1 genes, located at the chromosome 10q26 locus, are strongly associated with the risk of AMD, their downstream targets are unknown. Low population frequencies of risk alleles in tissue banks make it impractical to study their function in cells derived from autopsied tissue. Moreover, autopsy eyes from end-stage AMD patients, where age-related RPE atrophy and fibrosis are already present, cannot be used to determine how abnormal ARMS2/HTRA1 expression can initiate RPE pathology. Instead, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE from patients provides us with earlier stage AMD patient-specific cells and allows us to analyze the underlying mechanisms at this critical time point. An unbiased proteome screen of A2E-aged patient-specific iPS-derived RPE cell lines identified superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative defense in the genetic allele's susceptibility of AMD. The AMD-associated risk haplotype (T-in/del-A) impairs the ability of the RPE to defend against aging-related oxidative stress. SOD2 defense is impaired in RPE homozygous for the risk haplotype (T-in/del-A; T-in/del-A), while the effect was less pronounced in RPE homozygous for the protective haplotype (G-Wt-G; G-Wt-G).

Here, we test the ability of these vectors to sustain gene expression and phenotypic improvement for the life of the animal. NPs or naked DNA were subretinally injected in rpe65(-/-) mice at postnatal day (P) 16 and evaluated at 15 months PI. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence were performed at PI-15 months and demonstrated appreciable expression of transferred RPE65 (levels were 32% of wild-type [WT] for NPs and 44% of WT for naked DNA). No reduction in expression at the message level was observed from PI-6 month data. Spectral electroretinography (ERG) demonstrated significant improvement in cone ERG amplitudes in treated versus uninjected animals. Most importantly, we also observed reduced fundus autofluorescence in the eyes injected with NP and naked DNA compared to uninjected counterparts. Consistent with these observations, biochemical studies showed a reduction in the accumulation of toxic retinyl esters in treated mice, suggesting that the transferred hRPE65 was functional. These critical results indicate that both NP and uncompacted plasmid VMD2-hRPE65-S/MAR can mediate persistent, long-term improvement in an RPE-associated disease phenotype, and suggest that DNA NPs, which are non-toxic and have a large payload capacity, expand the treatment repertoire available for ocular gene therapy.", "Keywords": ["DNA nanoparticle", "Non-viral gene therapy", "RPE65", "Retinal pigment epithelium", "S/MAR"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Mice", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "cis-trans-Isomerases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adarsha", "Last Name": "Koirala", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, 940 Stanton L.
