Previous research suggests strength loss is not the cause, leaving impaired sensorimotor control as an alternative. Here we examine vestibular control of posture in 18\u00a0male volunteers before and after 60\u00a0days of bed rest. Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was used to evoke sway responses before, 1 and 6\u00a0days after bed rest under different head yaw orientations. The directional accuracy and precision of these responses were calculated from ground reaction force vectors. Bed rest caused up to 63% increases in spontaneous standing sway and 31% reductions in leg strength, changes which were uncorrelated. The increase in sway was exacerbated when the eyes were closed. Mean directions of SVS-evoked sway responses were unaffected, being directed towards the anodal ear and rotating in line with head orientation in the same way before and after bed rest. However, individual trial analysis revealed 25%-30% increases in directional variability, which were significantly correlated with the increase in spontaneous sway (r\u00a0=\u00a00.48-0.71; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.044) and were still elevated on day 6 post-bed rest. This reveals that individual sway responses may be inappropriately oriented, a finding masked by the averaging process. Our results confirm that impaired balance following prolonged bedrest is not related to loss of strength. Rather, they demonstrate that the sensorimotor transformation process which converts vestibular feedback into appropriately directed balance responses is impaired. KEY POINTS: Prolonged inactivity impairs balance but previous research suggests this is not caused by loss of strength. Here we investigated vestibular control of balance before and after 60\u00a0days of bed rest using electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) to evoke sway responses. Spontaneous sway significantly increased and muscle strength reduced following bed rest, but, in keeping with previous research, these two effects were not correlated. While the overall accuracy of EVS-evoked sway responses was unaffected, their directional variability significantly increased following bed rest, and this was correlated with the increases in spontaneous sway. We have shown that the ability to transform head-centred vestibular feedback into an appropriately directed body sway response is negatively affected by prolonged inactivity; this may contribute to the impaired balance commonly observed following bed rest.", "Keywords": ["accuracy", "bed rest", "electrical vestibular stimulation", "precision", "proprioceptive acuity"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Bed Rest", "Male", "Postural Balance", "Adult", "Vestibule, Labyrinth", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stuart W", "Last Name": "Mackenzie", "Affiliation": "School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."}, {"First Name": "Craig P", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."}, {"First Name": "Malcom F", "Last Name": "Tremblay", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Brian L", "Last Name": "Day", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Raymond F", "Last Name": "Reynolds", "Affiliation": "School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38714277", "Title": "Neuroanatomical distribution of fluorophores within adult RXFP3 Cre-tdTomato/YFP mouse brain.", "Abstract": "Relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3) is activated by relaxin-3 in the brain to influence arousal and related functions, such as feeding and stress responses. Two transgenic mouse lines have recently been developed that co-express different fluorophores within RXFP3-expressing neurons: either yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; RXFP3-Cre/YFP mice) or tdTomato (RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice). To date, the characteristics of neurons that express RXFP3-associated fluorophores in these mice have only been investigated in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. To better determine the utility of these fluorophore-expressing mice for further research, we characterised the neuroanatomical distribution of fluorophores throughout the brain of these mice and compared this to the published distribution of Rxfp3 mRNA (detected by in situ hybridisation) in wildtype mice. Coronal sections of RXFP3-Cre/YFP (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato (n\u00a0=\u00a08) mouse brains were imaged, and the density of fluorophore-expressing cells within various brain regions/nuclei was qualitatively assessed. Comparisons with our previously reported RXFP3 mRNA distribution revealed that of 212 brain regions that contained either fluorophore or RXFP3 mRNA, approximately half recorded densities that were within two qualitative measurements of each other (on a 9-point scale), including hippocampal dentate gyrus and amygdala subregions. However, many brain areas with likely non-authentic, false-positive, or false-negative fluorophore expression were also detected, including the cerebellum. Therefore, this study provides a guide to which brain regions should be prioritized for future study of RXFP3 in these mice, to better understand the neuroanatomy and function of this intriguing, neuronal peptide receptor.", "Keywords": ["Fluorophore immunohistochemistry", "Mouse brain", "Neuroanatomy", "Relaxin-3", "Relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Luminescent Proteins", "Mice, Transgenic", "Brain", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Male", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Neurons", "Integrases", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Red Fluorescent Protein", "Bacterial Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Izel M", "Last Name": "Eraslan", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Monique", "Last Name": "Egberts-Brugman", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Justin L", "Last Name": "Read", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Lara M", "Last Name": "Voglsanger", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rasika M", "Last Name": "Samarasinghe", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Lee", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Poshmaal", "Last Name": "Dhar", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leigh C", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Ch'ng", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Olivia M", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia; The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew L", "Last Name": "Gundlach", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation (IMPACT), Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia.

Mosquitoes from four traps yielded JEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Pools containing RNA positive mosquitoes were inoculated onto mosquito cell monolayers. Discussion: A single isolate of JEV was obtained from a pool of mixed mosquito species. Near whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate demonstrated its high genomic relatedness with JEV GIV pig sequences sampled from Queensland and the state of New South Wales in 2022. Conclusion: We report the first isolation of JEV GIV from mosquitoes collected in Australia. With only a few JEV GIV isolates available globally, the isolate we report will be essential for future research of JEV host interactions, evolution and disease markers, and development of effective therapies, vaccines, diagnostic assays, and mosquito control strategies.", "Keywords": ["Japanese encephalitis virus", "flavivirus", "mosquito", "phylogenetics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alyssa T", "Last Name": "Pyke", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Burtonclay", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nirdesh", "Last Name": "Poudel", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Wayne", "Last Name": "Ingall", "Affiliation": "Wide Bay Public Health Unit, Wide Bay Hospital and Health Service, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Neelima", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Hall-Mendelin", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Scott B", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Biosecurity Queensland, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan M", "Last Name": "Darbro", "Affiliation": "Metro North Public Health Unit, Queensland Health, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Cassie C", "Last Name": "Jansen", "Affiliation": "Communicable Diseases Branch and Health Protection and Regulation Branch, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "van den Hurk", "Affiliation": "Public Health Virology, Forensic and Scientific Services, Department of Health, Queensland Government, Queensland, Australia."}], "Journal": "Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2024Apr15"}, {"PMID": "38544301", "Title": "Setting the context for a complex dental intervention of role substitution in care homes: Initial process evaluation findings.", "Abstract": "SENIOR (uSing rolE-substitutioN In care homes to improve oRal health) is a randomised controlled trial designed to determine whether role substitution could improve oral health for this population.

In humans, the M\u00fcllerian ducts differentiate into the Fallopian tubes, uterus and upper portion of the vagina. In birds and reptiles, the M\u00fcllerian ducts develop into homologous structures, the oviducts. The genetic and hormonal regulation of duct development is a model for understanding sexual differentiation. In males, the ducts typically undergo regression during embryonic life, under the influence of testis-derived Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone, AMH. In females, a lack of AMH during embryogenesis allows the ducts to differentiate into the female reproductive tract. In the chicken embryo, a long-standing model for development and sexual differentiation, M\u00fcllerian duct development in females in asymmetric. Only the left duct forms an oviduct, coincident with ovary formation only on the left side of the body. The right duct, together with the right gonad, becomes vestigial. The mechanism of this avian asymmetry has never been fully resolved, but is thought to involve local interplay between AMH and sex steroid hormones. This mini-review re-visits the topic, highlighting questions in the field and proposing a testable model for asymmetric duct development. We argue that current molecular and imaging techniques will shed new light on this curious asymmetry.

Clopidogrel is prescribed to people who have had a non-cardioembolic stroke. There is evidence that clopidogrel is not effective for patients with CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. Pharmacogenetic testing is a potential strategy to identify such patients and guide prescription of appropriate antiplatelet treatment. This study aimed to provide an early estimate of the cost-effectiveness of using a point-of-care pharmacogenetic CYP2C19 test in the UK National Health System. Methods: A decision-analytic model comprising a linked decision tree and Markov model were created in R comparing pharmacogenetic testing with current prescribing practice. In the pharmacogenetic testing arm, patients identified to have one of three loss-of-function alleles were prescribed modified-release dipyridamole and aspirin or aspirin alone. Indicative data were sourced from reviews of the literature supported by expert consultation to select the most appropriate value for the input parameters. The healthcare costs (\u00a3;2021) and quality adjusted life years resulting from each strategy were estimated and the incremental cost-effectiveness of testing calculated. Deterministic threshold analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Results: The pharmacogenetic testing strategy generated 0.107 additional QALYs per patient tested and saved \u00a3512. Pharmacogenetic testing dominated current prescribing practice. The results were robust to extreme changes in key input variables. The PSA suggested that there was a 77% chance that pharmacogenetic testing would be cost-effective with a 62% chance it is cost-saving. Conclusions: A point-of-care pharmacogenetic test to guide prescription of clopidogrel for people who have experienced a stroke has the potential to provide a significant health gain by preventing secondary strokes and may save resources in the health system.

Animals were allowed to recover for 1.5\u2009h after treatment to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), and 3\u2009days or 14\u2009days post-stroke to evaluate lesion volume and functional outcomes. At 3-days post-stroke preconditioned MSCs reduced (by 67%) lesion volume and increased CBF (by 32%) compared to vehicle, while non-conditioned MSCs had no effect. A separate cohort of animals recovered to 14\u2009days post-stroke also showed reduced infarct volume (by 51%) at 48\u2009h (assessed by MRI) and better functional recovery at 14\u2009days when treated with preconditioned MSCs when compared to vehicle. Preconditioning MSCs with IL-1\u03b1 increases their neuroprotective capability and improves functional recovery after delayed intra-arterial administration. With increasing use of thrombectomy, the adjunct use of preconditioned MSCs therefore represents a highly relevant therapy to improve outcomes in ischemic stroke.", "Keywords": ["Stroke", "mesenchymal", "pre-clinical", "therapy", "translation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Ischemic Stroke", "Interleukin-1alpha", "Stroke", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Raymond", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Craig J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Geoffrey Jefferson Brain Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stuart M", "Last Name": "Allan", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Pinteaux", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}], "Journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "37562760", "Title": "Carotid Artery Diameter Correlates with Plaque Volume but not with Degree of Stenosis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Carotid artery disease", "Carotid plaque volume", "Outward arterial remodelling"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Constriction, Pathologic", "Carotid Arteries", "Carotid Artery, Common", "Carotid Stenosis", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Phair", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science, Manchester University NHS Foundation trust, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Vascular research and Innovation Centre (MAVRIC), Manchester University NHS Foundation trust, Manchester University NHS Foundation trust, Manchester, UK.

Despite their great size, abyssal plains extend across modest environmental gradients compared to other marine ecosystems. However, little is known about the patterns and processes regulating biodiversity or potentially delimiting biogeographical boundaries at regional scales in the abyss. Improved macroecological understanding of remote abyssal environments is urgent as threats of widespread anthropogenic disturbance grow in the deep ocean. Here, we use a new, basin-scale dataset to show the existence of clear regional zonation in abyssal communities across the 5,000\u2009km span of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (northeast Pacific), an area targeted for deep-sea mining. We found two pronounced biogeographic provinces, deep and shallow-abyssal, separated by a transition zone between 4,300 and 4,800\u2009m depth. Surprisingly, species richness was maintained across this boundary by phylum-level taxonomic replacements. These regional transitions are probably related to calcium carbonate saturation boundaries as taxa dependent on calcium carbonate structures, such as shelled molluscs, appear restricted to the shallower province. Our results suggest geochemical and climatic forcing on distributions of abyssal populations over large spatial scales and provide a potential paradigm for deep-sea macroecology, opening a new basis for regional-scale biodiversity research and conservation strategies in Earth's largest biome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Ecosystem", "Biodiversity", "Calcium Carbonate", "Carbonates"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Simon-Lled\u00f3", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK. erimon@noc.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Diva J", "Last Name": "Amon", "Affiliation": "SpeSeas, D'Abadie, Trinidad and Tobago."}, {"First Name": "Guadalupe", "Last Name": "Bribiesca-Contreras", "Affiliation": "Natural History Museum, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daphne", "Last Name": "Cuvelier", "Affiliation": "Institute of Marine Sciences-Okeanos, University of the Azores, Horta, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Durden", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sofia P", "Last Name": "Ramalho", "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies & Department of Biology, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Katja", "Last Name": "Uhlenkott", "Affiliation": "German Centre for Marine Biodiversity Research, Senckenberg am Meer, Wilhelmshaven, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Pedro Martinez", "Last Name": "Arbizu", "Affiliation": "German Centre for Marine Biodiversity Research, Senckenberg am Meer, Wilhelmshaven, Germany."}, {"First Name": "No\u00eblie", "Last Name": "Benoist", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Copley", "Affiliation": "Ocean & Earth Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Dahlgren", "Affiliation": "NORCE Climate and Environment, Bergen, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Adrian G", "Last Name": "Glover", "Affiliation": "Natural History Museum, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Bethany", "Last Name": "Fleming", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tammy", "Last Name": "Horton", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Se-Jong", "Last Name": "Ju", "Affiliation": "Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, Busan, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Alejandra", "Last Name": "Mej\u00eda-Saenz", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kirsty", "Last Name": "McQuaid", "Affiliation": "University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Pape", "Affiliation": "Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Chailinn", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, Busan, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel O B", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}], "Journal": "Nature ecology & evolution", "PubDate": "2023Sep"}, {"PMID": "37480983", "Title": "Valve-sparing aortic root replacement versus composite valve graft with bioprosthesis in patients under age 50.", "Abstract": "Although the unique risks of implanting a prosthetic valve after aortic valve (AV) surgery in young patients are well established, studies of aortic root replacement (ARR) are lacking.

The effectiveness of metabolic activity in hepatocytes is determined by the quality and quantity of its mitochondria. Mitochondrial function is complex, and they act via various dynamic networks, which rapidly adapt to changes in the cellular milieu. Our present study aims to investigate the effects of low protein programming on the structure and function of mitochondria in the hepatocytes of adult females. Pregnant rats were fed with a control or isocaloric low-protein diet from gestational day 4 until delivery. A normal laboratory chow was given to all dams after delivery and to pups after weaning. The rats were euthanized at 4 months of age and the livers were collected from female offspring for investigating the mitochondrial structure, mtDNA copy number, mRNA, and proteins expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and used for the analysis of the mitochondrial bioenergetics profiles. The mitochondrial ultrastructure showed that the in utero low-protein diet exposure led to increased mitochondrial fusion. Accordingly, there was an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial fusion gene Opa1 and mitochondrial biogenesis genes Pgc1a and Essra, but Fis1, a fission gene, was downregulated. Low protein programming also impaired the mitochondrial function of the hepatocytes with a decrease in basal respiration ATP-linked respiration and proton leak. In summary, the present study suggests that the hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an in utero low protein diet might be a potential mechanism linking glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in adult offspring.", "Keywords": ["developmental programming", "insulin resistance", "lean T2D", "mitochondria dysfunction", "mitochondrial dynamics"], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Rats", "Animals", "Female", "Diet, Protein-Restricted", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Mitochondria", "Hepatocytes", "Oxygen Consumption"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vipin A", "Last Name": "Vidyadharan", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Perinatology Research Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chellakkan S", "Last Name": "Blesson", "Affiliation": "Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Division, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daren", "Last Name": "Tanchico", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Perinatology Research Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ancizar", "Last Name": "Betancourt", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Perinatology Research Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA 95051, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chandra", "Last Name": "Yallampalli", "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Perinatology Research Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}], "Journal": "Nutrients", "PubDate": "2023Mar24"}, {"PMID": "37021168", "Title": "Molecular biomarkers predicting newly detected atrial fibrillation after ischaemic stroke or TIA: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Several molecular biomarkers are available that predict newly detected atrial fibrillation (NDAF).

Recently, single cell RNA-seq data have indicated that chicken steroidogenic cells are derived from differentiated supporting cells. This differentiation process is achieved by a sequential upregulation of steroidogenic genes and downregulation of supporting cell markers. The exact mechanism regulating this differentiation process remains unknown. We have identified TOX3 as a previously unreported transcription factor expressed in embryonic Sertoli cells of the chicken testis. TOX3 knockdown in males resulted in increased CYP17A1-positive Leydig cells. TOX3 overexpression in male and female gonads resulted in a significant decline in CYP17A1-positive steroidogenic cells. In ovo knockdown of the testis determinant DMRT1 in male gonads resulted in a downregulation of TOX3 expression. Conversely, DMRT1 overexpression caused an increase in TOX3 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that DMRT1-mediated regulation of TOX3 modulates expansion of the steroidogenic lineage, either directly, via cell lineage allocation, or indirectly, via signaling from the supporting to steroidogenic cell populations.", "Keywords": ["Chicken", "DMRT1", "Gonad", "Steroidogenic", "TOX3"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chick Embryo", "Male", "Female", "Chickens", "Cell Lineage", "Sex Determination Processes", "Transcription Factors", "Gonads", "Testis", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Sex Differentiation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Estermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2023Mar01"}, {"PMID": "36762231", "Title": "\ufeffBenthic megafauna of the western Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean.", "Abstract": "There is a growing interest in the exploitation of deep-sea mineral deposits, particularly on the abyssal seafloor of the central Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), which is rich in polymetallic nodules. In order to effectively manage potential exploitation activities, a thorough understanding of the biodiversity, community structure, species ranges, connectivity, and ecosystem functions across a range of scales is needed. The benthic megafauna plays an important role in the functioning of deep-sea ecosystems and represents an important component of the biodiversity. While megafaunal surveys using video and still images have provided insight into CCZ biodiversity, the collection of faunal samples is needed to confirm species identifications to accurately estimate species richness and species ranges, but faunal collections are very rarely carried out. Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle, 55 specimens of benthic megafauna were collected from seamounts and abyssal plains in three Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI 1, APEI 4, and APEI 7) at 3100-5100 m depth in the western CCZ. Using both morphological and molecular evidence, 48 different morphotypes belonging to five phyla were found, only nine referrable to known species, and 39 species potentially new to science.

Across these measures, both children and adults consistently evaluated villains' true selves to be more negative than heroes'. Importantly, at the same time, we also detected an asymmetry in the judgments, wherein villains were more likely than heroes to have a true self that differed from their outward behavior.

The first cell type to differentiate gives rise to pre-Sertoli cells in the testis, and pre-follicular cells in the ovary. These cells derive from a common lineage of so-called \"supporting cells\". In birds and other egg-laying vertebrates, locally synthesised estrogen has a central role in ovarian development and influences the fate of these supporting cells. Manipulation of estrogen levels during embryonic development induces gonadal sex reversal, providing an experimental setting to evaluate the process of gonadal sex differentiation. Recently, we identified PAX2 as a novel marker of the undifferentiated supporting cell lineage in the chicken embryo, expressed in both sexes prior to overt gonadal sex differentiation. PAX2 expression is downregulated at the onset of gonadal sex differentiation in both males and females. The analysis of this undifferentiated supporting cell marker, together with Sertoli (male) and pre-granulosa (female) will enhance our understanding of supporting cell differentiation. Here we characterized the supporting cells differentiation process and identified undifferentiated supporting cells in estrogen-mediated sex reversal experiments. Female embryos treated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole developed into ovotestis, containing pre-granulosa cells, Sertoli cells and PAX2 positive undifferentiated supporting cells. In contrast, male embryos treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol showed no PAX2+ undifferentiated gonadal supporting cells. Fadrozole time-course as well as multiple dose analysis suggests that supporting cell transdifferentiation involves a dedifferentiation event into a PAX2+ undifferentiated supporting cell state, followed by a redifferentiation towards the opposite sex lineage.", "Keywords": ["PAX2", "chicken", "estrogen", "fadrozole", "gonad", "sex-reversal"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Estermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36395290", "Title": "The validity and reliability of wearable devices for the measurement of vertical oscillation for running.", "Abstract": "Wearable devices are a popular training tool to measure biomechanical performance indicators during running, including vertical oscillation (VO).

Fifteen participants completed treadmill running at five different self-selected speeds for one minute at each speed. Each speed interval was completed twice. VO was recorded simultaneously by video and the wearables devices. There was significant effect of measurement method on VO (p < 0.001), with the NOVA and Footpod underestimating VO compared to video analysis, while the HRM and RDP overestimated. Although there were significant differences in the average VO values, all devices were significantly correlated with the video analysis (R > = 0.51, p < 0.001). Significant agreement between repeated VO measurements for all devices, revealed the devices to be reliable (ICC > = 0.948, p < 0.001).

This review aims to summarise the key alterations to myeloid immunity in acute ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). By integrating clinical and preclinical research, we discover how myeloid immunity is affected across multiple organ systems including the brain, blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lung, and evaluate how these perturbations associate with real-world outcomes including infection. These findings are placed in the context of the rapidly developing field of human immunology, which offers a wealth of opportunity for further research.", "Keywords": ["Immune", "Inflammation", "Myeloid", "Stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Stroke", "Brain Ischemia", "Hemorrhagic Stroke", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Stephens", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Grainger", "Affiliation": "Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Craig J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Geoffrey Jefferson Brain Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stuart M", "Last Name": "Allan", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuroscience, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. stuart.allan@manchester.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Seminars in immunopathology", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "36310609", "Title": "Co-designing for behaviour change: The development of a theory-informed oral-care intervention for stroke survivors.", "Abstract": "This article discusses how research to understand the oral care needs and experiences of stroke survivors was translated into a prototypical intervention. It addresses the challenge of how to develop service improvements in healthcare settings that are both person-centred, through the use of co-design, and also based on theory and evidence. A sequence of co-design workshops with stroke survivors, family carers, and with health and social care professionals, ran in parallel with an analysis of behavioural factors. This determined key actions which could improve mouthcare for this community and identified opportunities to integrate recognized behaviour-change techniques into the intervention. In this way, behaviour change theory, evidence\u00a0from qualitative research, and experience-based co-design were effectively combined. The intervention proposed is predominantly a patient-facing resource, intended to support stroke survivors and their carers with mouth care, as they transition from hospital care to living at home. This addresses a gap in existing provision, as other published oral-care protocols for stroke are clinician-facing and concerned primarily with acute care (in the first days after a stroke). Although it draws on the experiences of a single design project, this study articulates a 'working relationship' between design practice methods and the application of behaviour change theory.", "Keywords": ["Co-design", "EBCD", "behaviour change", "oral-care", "person-centred care", "stroke care"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Lievesley", "Affiliation": "School of Design, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}, {"First Name": "Rachael", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychology & Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Carey", "Affiliation": "School of Design, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Hulme", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Lucy", "Last Name": "O'Malley", "Affiliation": "Division of Dentistry, School of Medical Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Westoby", "Affiliation": "Stroke Survivor and Public Contributor in the research team, Leigh, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jess", "Last Name": "Zadik", "Affiliation": "Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Audrey", "Last Name": "Bowen", "Affiliation": "Geoffrey Jefferson Brain Research Centre, The Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Northern Care Alliance & University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Brocklehurst", "Affiliation": "NWORTH Clinical Trials Unit, University of Bangor, Bangor, UK."}, {"First Name": "Craig J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neurosciences, Geoffrey Jefferson Brain Research Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK."}], "Journal": "Design for health (Abingdon, England)", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36182026", "Title": "Organisation of enkephalin inputs and outputs of the central nucleus of the amygdala in mice.", "Abstract": "The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a key hub integrating sensory inputs and modulating behavioural outputs. The CeA is a complex structure with discrete subdivisions, high peptidergic heterogeneity and broad CNS afferent and efferent projections. While several neuropeptide systems within the CeA have been examined in detail, less is known about CeA preproenkephalin (ppENK) cells. Here, we used a recently developed transgenic Penk-Cre mouse line to advance our understanding of the efferent and afferent connectivity of ppENK in the CeA. First, to determine the fidelity of Cre expression in Penk-Cre transgenic mice, we conducted RNAscope in the CeA of Penk-Cre mice. Our analysis revealed that 96.6 % of CeA Cre+ neurons co-expressed pENK mRNA, and 99.7 % of CeA pENK+ neurons co-expressed Cre mRNA, indicating faithful recapitulation of Cre expression in CeA ppENK-expressing cells, supporting the fidelity of the Penk-Cre reporter mouse. Anterograde tracing of CeAPenk cells showed strong efferent projections to the extended amygdala, midbrain and hindbrain PBN and NTS. Retrograde tracing of Penk afferents to the CeA were more restricted, with primary innervation originating within the amygdala complex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and minor innervation from the parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Together, our data provide a comprehensive map of ENKergic efferent and afferent connectivity of the CeA in Penk-Cre mice.

Furthermore, we define a new role for BMP signalling during early limb development, revealing that it is necessary for inducing a somatic LPM fate and initiation of limb outgrowth, potentially through activation of TBX5.

We previously reported that stroke induces an ablation of multiple sub-populations of B cells and reduces levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, which coincides with the development of spontaneous bacterial pneumonia. The loss of IgM after stroke could be an important determinant of infection susceptibility and highlights this pathway as a target for intervention. We treated mice with a replacement dose of IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IgM-IVIg) prior to and 24\u2009h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and allowed them to recover for 2- or 5-day post-surgery. Treatment with IgM-IVIg enhanced bacterial clearance from the lung after MCAO and improved lung pathology but did not impact brain infarct volume. IgM-IVIg treatment induced immunomodulatory effects systemically, including rescue of splenic plasma B cell numbers and endogenous mouse IgM and IgA circulating immunoglobulin concentrations that were reduced by MCAO. Treatment attenuated MCAO-induced elevation of selected pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. IgM-IVIg treatment did not increase the number of lung mononuclear phagocytes or directly modulate macrophage phagocytic capacity but enhanced phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus bioparticles in vitro. Low-dose IgM-IVIg contributes to increased clearance of spontaneous lung bacteria after MCAO likely via increasing availability of antibody in the lung to enhance opsonophagocytic activity. Immunomodulatory effects of IgM-IVIg treatment may also contribute to reduced levels of damage in the lung after MCAO.

The taxa are sister clades whose members consume wood as food with the aid of intracellular cellulolytic endosymbionts housed in their gills. This combination of adaptations is found in no other group of animals and was likely present in the common ancestor of both families. Despite these commonalities, the two families have followed dramatically different evolutionary paths with respect to anatomy, life history and distribution. Here we present 42 new mitochondrial genome sequences from Teredinidae and Xylophagaidae and show that distinct trajectories have also occurred in the evolution and organization of their mitochondrial genomes. Teredinidae display significantly greater rates of amino acid substitution but absolute conservation of protein-coding gene order, whereas Xylophagaidae display significantly less amino acid change but have undergone numerous and diverse changes in genome organization since their divergence from a common ancestor. As with many bivalves, these mitochondrial genomes encode two ribosomal RNAs, 12 protein coding genes, and 22 tRNAs; atp8 was not detected. We further show that their phylogeny, as inferred from amino acid sequences of 12 concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding genes, is largely congruent with those inferred from their nuclear genomes based on 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA sequences. Our results provide a robust phylogenetic framework to explore the tempo and mode of mitochondrial genome evolution and offer directions for future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of wood-boring bivalves.", "Keywords": ["Marine woodborers", "deep-sea", "mitochondrial gene order", "shipworm", "xylophagy", "xylotrophy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuanning", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}, {"First Name": "Marvin A", "Last Name": "Altamia", "Affiliation": "Ocean Genome Legacy Center, Department of Marine and Environmental Science, Northeastern University, Nahant, MA,USA."}, {"First Name": "J Reuben", "Last Name": "Shipway", "Affiliation": "Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre, School of Biological and Marine Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, PL4 8AA, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mercer R", "Last Name": "Brugler", "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Sciences, University of South Carolina Beaufort, 801 Carteret Street, Beaufort, SC 29902."}, {"First Name": "Angelo Fraga", "Last Name": "Bernardino", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Oceanografia, Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo, Vit\u00f3ria-ES, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Tha\u00eds Lima", "Last Name": "de Brito", "Affiliation": "Drug Research and Development Center, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Cear\u00e1, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Zhenjian", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francisca Andr\u00e9a", "Last Name": "da Silva Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Drug Research and Development Center, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Cear\u00e1, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Paulo", "Last Name": "Sumida", "Affiliation": "Instituto Oceanogr\u00e1fico da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo-SP, BRASIL."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Hawai'i, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Amaro", "Last Name": "Trindade-Silva", "Affiliation": "Drug Research and Development Center, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Cear\u00e1, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Halanych", "Affiliation": "Center for Marine Science, University of North Carolina Wilmington, North Carolina, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Daniel L", "Last Name": "Distel", "Affiliation": "Ocean Genome Legacy Center, Department of Marine and Environmental Science, Northeastern University, Nahant, MA,USA."}], "Journal": "Genome biology and evolution", "PubDate": "2022Jun17"}, {"PMID": "35708794", "Title": "Direct Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Versus Radiological Gastrostomy in Patients Unable to Undergo Transoral Endoscopic Pull Gastrostomy.", "Abstract": "A subset of patients needing long-term enteral access are unable to undergo a conventional transoral \"pull\" percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

However, few data exist on the prognostic impact of elevated baseline NLR or change in NLR levels during follow-up in patients undergoing transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR or SAVR) for aortic stenosis. Methods and Results NLR was available in 5881 patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving TAVR or SAVR in PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) I, II, and S3 trials/registries (median [Q1, Q3] NLR, 3.30 [2.40, 4.90]); mean NLR, 4.10; range, 0.5-24.9) and was evaluated as continuous variable and categorical tertiles (low: NLR \u22642.70, n=1963; intermediate: NLR 2.70-4.20, n=1958; high: NLR \u22654.20, n=1960). No patients had known baseline infection. High baseline NLR was associated with increased risk of death or rehospitalization at 3\u00a0years (58.4% versus 41.0%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.18-1.63; P<0.0001) compared with those with low NLR, irrespective of treatment modality. In both patients treated with TAVR and patients treated with SAVR, NLR decreased between baseline and 2\u00a0years. A 1-unit observed decrease in NLR between baseline and 1\u00a0year was associated with lower risk of death or rehospitalization between 1\u00a0year and 3\u00a0years (aHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89; P<0.0001). Conclusions Elevated baseline NLR was independently associated with increased subsequent mortality and rehospitalization after TAVR or SAVR. The observed decrease in NLR after TAVR or SAVR was associated with improved outcomes.

This study sought to investigate novel functions for CISH outside of the immune system. Mice deficient in CISH were generated and analyzed using a range of metabolic and other parameters, including in response to a high fat diet and leptin administration. CISH knockout mice possessed decreased body fat and showed resistance to diet-induced obesity. This was associated with reduced food intake, but unaltered energy expenditure and microbiota composition. CISH ablation resulted in reduced basal expression of the orexigenic Agrp gene in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) region of the brain. Cish was basally expressed in the ARC, with evidence of co-expression with the leptin receptor (Lepr) gene in Agrp-positive neurons. CISH-deficient mice also showed enhanced leptin responsiveness, although Cish expression was not itself modulated by leptin. CISH-deficient mice additionally exhibited improved insulin sensitivity on a high-fat diet, but not glucose tolerance despite reduced body weight.

We had earlier demonstrated that LP programming affects glucose disposal in females. Mitochondrial health is crucial for normal glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we sought to analyze mitochondrial structure, function, and associated genes in skeletal muscles to explore the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance LP-programmed female offspring. On day four of pregnancy, rats were assigned to a control diet containing 20% protein or an isocaloric 6% protein-containing diet. Standard laboratory diet was given to the dams after delivery until the end of weaning and to pups after weaning. Gestational LP diet led to changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure in the gastrocnemius muscles, including a nine-fold increase in the presence of giant mitochondria along with unevenly formed cristae. Further, functional analysis showed that LP programming caused impaired mitochondrial functions. Although the mitochondrial copy number did not show significant changes, key genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function such as Fis1, Opa1, Mfn2, Nrf1, Nrf2, Pgc1b, Cox4b, Esrra, and Vdac were dysregulated.

In both human and time-course experimental samples, diabetic hearts exhibited abnormal ER, with a maladaptive shift over time in rodents. Furthermore, as a cardiac ER dysfunction model, mice with cardiac-specific p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) deletion exhibited heightened myocardial inflammatory response in diabetes. Mechanistically, maladaptive ER stress-induced CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) is a novel transcriptional regulator of cardiac high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1). Cardiac stress-induced release of HMGB1 facilitates M1 macrophage polarization, aggravating myocardial inflammation. Therapeutically, sequestering the extracellular HMGB1 using glycyrrhizin conferred cardioprotection through its anti-inflammatory action. Our findings also indicated that an intact cardiac ER function and protective effects of the antidiabetic drug interdependently attenuated the cardiac inflammation-induced dysfunction.

Here, we compare global-scale eukaryotic DNA metabarcoding datasets (18S-V9) from abyssal and lower bathyal surficial sediments and euphotic and aphotic ocean pelagic layers to distinguish plankton from benthic diversity in sediment material. Based on 1685 samples collected throughout the world ocean, we show that DOS diversity is at least threefold that in pelagic realms, with nearly two-thirds represented by abundant yet unknown eukaryotes. These benthic communities are spatially structured by ocean basins and particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from the upper ocean. Plankton DNA reaching the DOS originates from abundant species, with maximal deposition at high latitudes. Its seafloor DNA signature predicts variations in POC export from the surface and reveals previously overlooked taxa that may drive the biological carbon pump.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Cordier", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "In\u00e8s Barrenechea", "Last Name": "Angeles", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Station Biologique de Roscoff, UMR 7144, ECOMAP,, 29680 Roscoff, France."}, {"First Name": "Franck", "Last Name": "Lejzerowicz", "Affiliation": "Center for Microbiome Innovation, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9dric", "Last Name": "Berney", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Station Biologique de Roscoff, UMR 7144, ECOMAP,, 29680 Roscoff, France."}, {"First Name": "Rapha\u00ebl", "Last Name": "Morard", "Affiliation": "MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Leobener Strasse 8, 28359 Bremen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Angelika", "Last Name": "Brandt", "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Zoology, Section Crustacea, Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum, Senckenberganlage 25, 60325 Frankfurt, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Anne", "Last Name": "Cambon-Bonavita", "Affiliation": "Univ Brest, Ifremer, CNRS, Laboratoire de Microbiologie des Environnements Extr\u00eames, Plouzan\u00e9, France."}, {"First Name": "Lionel", "Last Name": "Guidi", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'oc\u00e9anographie de Villefranche (LOV), Observatoire Oc\u00e9anologique, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, CNRS, Villefranche-sur-Mer, 06230 Nice, France."}, {"First Name": "Fabien", "Last Name": "Lombard", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'oc\u00e9anographie de Villefranche (LOV), Observatoire Oc\u00e9anologique, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, CNRS, Villefranche-sur-Mer, 06230 Nice, France."}, {"First Name": "Pedro Martinez", "Last Name": "Arbizu", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg am Meer, German Centre for Marine Biodiversity Research, S\u00fcdstrand 44, 26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ramon", "Last Name": "Massana", "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography, Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Covadonga", "Last Name": "Orejas", "Affiliation": "Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO), Oceanographic Centre of Gij\u00f3n,, Avda Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias 70 bis, 33212 Gij\u00f3n, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Poulain", "Affiliation": "Research Federation for the study of Global Ocean Systems Ecology and Evolution, FR2022/Tara GOSEE, 75016 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Wincker", "Affiliation": "Research Federation for the study of Global Ocean Systems Ecology and Evolution, FR2022/Tara GOSEE, 75016 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Sophie", "Last Name": "Arnaud-Haond", "Affiliation": "MARBEC, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Ifremer, CNRS, IRD, S\u00e8te, France."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Gooday", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Colomban", "Last Name": "de Vargas", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Station Biologique de Roscoff, UMR 7144, ECOMAP,, 29680 Roscoff, France."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Pawlowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2022Feb04"}, {"PMID": "35084101", "Title": "Three-year survival of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in dialysis.", "Abstract": "To highlight the trends of surgical (open) aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as well as to compare the outcome between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and SAVR in elderly dialysis patients.

Whilst genetic characterization of MPOV has been previously described, only restricted to sequence information for segments 2 and 3 coding core protein VP2 and outer capsid protein VP3, respectively. This study presents for the first time nearly full-length genome sequences of MPOV, which represent 24 isolates collected over a span of more than 20\u2009years from 1997 to 2018. Whilst the majority of isolates were sampled at Beatrice Hill, NT where MPOV is most frequently isolated, this report also describes the first two isolations of MPOV from Queensland (QLD), Australia. One of which is the first non-bovine isolate obtained from the mosquito vector Aedes vittiger. We further compared these MPOV sequences with known sequences of the Yunnan orbivirus and other known orbivirus sequences of mosquito origin found in Australia. The phylogenetic analyses indicate the Australian MPOV sequences are more closely related to each other than other known sequences of Yunnan orbivirus. Furthermore, MPOV sequences are closely related to sequences from the Indonesian isolate JKT-8650.

Still, these classes of analgesic drugs have many potential limitations as they induce analgesic tolerance, addiction and numerous behavioural adverse effects that often result in patient non-compliance. As opium and opioids have been traditionally used as painkillers, the exact mechanisms of their adverse reactions over repeated use are multifactorial and not fully understood. Older adults suffer from cancer and non-cancer chronic pain more than younger adults, due to the physiological changes related to ageing and their reduced metabolic capabilities and thus show an increased number of adverse reactions to opioid drugs. All clinically used opioids are \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists, and the major adverse effects are directly or potentially connected to this receptor. Multifunctional opioid ligands or peripherally restricted opioids may elicit fewer adverse effects, as shown in preclinical studies, but these results need reproducibility from further extensive clinical trials. The current review aims to overview various mechanisms involved in the adverse effects induced by opioids, to provide a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and, ultimately, to help develop an effective therapeutic strategy to better manage pain.", "Keywords": ["adverse effects", "analgesia", "behaviour", "chronic pain", "morphine", "opioids", "tolerance"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alok K", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS 7001, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "Rahmatullah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering, University of Development Alternative, Dhanmondi, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Veeranoot", "Last Name": "Nissapatorn", "Affiliation": "School of Allied Health Sciences, World Union for Herbal Drug Discovery (WUHeDD) and Research Excellence Center for Innovation and Health Products (RECIHP), Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80160, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Polrat", "Last Name": "Wilairatana", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Spetea", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy and Center for Molecular Biosciences (CMBI), University of Innsbruck, Innrain 80-82, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Nuri", "Last Name": "Gueven", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS 7001, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nikolas", "Last Name": "Dietis", "Affiliation": "Medical School, University of Cyprus, Nicosia 1678, Cyprus."}], "Journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2021Oct27"}, {"PMID": "34793406", "Title": "Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with functional abdominal pain: a randomized clinical trial testing differential efficacy by patient subgroup.", "Abstract": "Inconsistent results of psychological treatments for pediatric functional abdominal pain (FAP) may be due to heterogeneity of patients' pain-related psychological characteristics.

We have tested a novel Ala1144Val ADAMTS13 variant (constitutively active [ca] ADAMTS13) that exhibits constitutive activity, characterized using in\u00a0vitro assays of ADAMTS13 activity, and greatly enhanced thrombolytic activity in 2 murine models of ischemic stroke, the distal FeCl3 middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) with systemic inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The primary measure of efficacy in both models was restoration of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to the MCA territory, which was determined using laser speckle contrast imaging. The caADAMTS13 variant exhibited a constitutively active conformation and a fivefold enhanced activity against fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate von Willebrand factor 73 (FRETS-VWF73) compared with wild-type (wt) ADAMTS13. Moreover, caADAMTS13 inhibited VWF-mediated platelet capture at subphysiological concentrations and enhanced t-PA/plasmin lysis of fibrin(ogen), neither of which were observed with wtADAMTS13. Significant restoration of rCBF and reduced lesion volume was observed in animals treated with caADAMTS13.

To do this, we performed in vivo renal micropuncture on Wistar rats, collected PCT tubular fluid from superficial nephrons, and measured Fe concentration. The Fe concentration profile along the S2 PCT suggested significant Fe reabsorption. Proximal tubules were also microperfused in vivo with physiological solutions containing Fe and Zn, Cu, Mn, or Cd.

Addition of ascorbate (1mmol.l-1) to the perfusate did not significantly alter Fe, Na, or water reabsorption. Supplementing the control perfusate with 60\u03bcmol.l-1 FeSO4 significantly decreased 55Fe uptake. Recalculating for the altered molar activity following addition of unlabeled Fe revealed a three-fold increase in Fe flux.

The paired testes of birds differentiate during embryogenesis, first marked by the development of pre-Sertoli cells in the gonadal primordium and their condensation into seminiferous cords. Germ cells become enclosed in these cords and enter mitotic arrest, while steroidogenic Leydig cells subsequently differentiate around the cords. This review describes our current understanding of avian testis development at the cell biology and genetic levels. Most of this knowledge has come from studies on the chicken embryo, though other species are increasingly being examined. In chicken, testis development is governed by the Z-chromosome-linked DMRT1 gene, which directly or indirectly activates the male factors, HEMGN, SOX9 and AMH.

These cells are thought to direct other gonadal cell lineages down the testis or ovarian pathways, including the germline. Recent research has shown that, in contrast to mouse, chicken gonadal supporting cells derive from a PAX2/OSR1/DMRT1/WNT4 positive mesenchymal cell population. These cells colonize the undifferentiated genital ridge during early gonadogenesis, around the time that germ cells migrate into the gonad. During the process of somatic gonadal sex differentiation, PAX2 expression is down-regulated in embryonic chicken gonads just prior to up-regulation of testis- and ovary-specific markers and prior to germ cell differentiation. Most research on avian gonadal development has focused on the chicken model, and related species from the Galloanserae clade. There is a lack of knowledge on gonadal sex differentiation in other avian lineages. Comparative analysis in birds is required to fully understand the mechanisms of avian sex determination and gonadal differentiation. Here we report the first comparative molecular characterization of gonadal supporting cell differentiation in birds from each of the three main clades, Galloanserae (chicken and quail), Neoaves (zebra finch) and Palaeognathe (emu). Our analysis reveals conservation of PAX2+ expression and a mesenchymal origin of supporting cells in each clade. Moreover, down-regulation of PAX2 expression precisely defines the onset of gonadal sex differentiation in each species. Altogether, these results indicate that gonadal morphogenesis is conserved among the major bird clades.", "Keywords": ["DMRT1", "Evo-Devo", "PAX2", "embryonic gonad", "gonadal sex differentiation", "sex determination"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Estermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mylene M", "Last Name": "Mariette", "Affiliation": "Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Julie L M", "Last Name": "Moreau", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Combes", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34499123", "Title": "Cardiovascular comorbidities, inflammation, and cerebral small vessel disease.", "Abstract": "Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment and affects all levels of the brain's vasculature.

Due to an ageing population, incidence of cSVD is continually rising. Despite its prevalence and its ability to cause multiple debilitating illnesses, such as stroke and dementia, there are currently no therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cSVD. In the healthy brain, interactions between neuronal, vascular, and inflammatory cells are required for normal functioning. When these interactions are disturbed, chronic pathological inflammation can ensue. The interplay between cSVD and inflammation has attracted much recent interest, and this review discusses chronic cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension, and explores how the associated inflammation may impact on the structure and function of the small arteries of the brain in cSVD.

This review considers the female reproductive tract from the perspective of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).

In most vertebrates, the female reproductive tract develops from paired embryonic tubes, the M\u00fcllerian ducts. We propose that formation of the M\u00fcllerian duct is a conserved process that has involved co-option of genes and molecular pathways involved in tubulogenesis in the adjacent mesonephric kidney and Wolffian duct. Downstream of this conservation, genetic regulatory divergence has occurred, generating diversity in duct structure. Plasticity of the Hox gene code and wnt signaling, in particular, may underlie morphological variation of the uterus in mammals, and evolution of the vagina.

The literature on ecological responses to the arrival of naturally sunk and implanted whale carcasses on the seafloor represents a potential source of information relevant to questions of human body survival and recovery in the deep ocean. Whale falls trigger the formation of complex, localized, and dense biological communities that have become a point of interest for marine biologists for the past 2-3 decades. Researchers have documented whale falls by whale type, size, geographic location, water depth and water chemistry, and there have been some comparative analyses of decomposition rates and faunal presence on carcasses. We undertook a review and meta-analysis of the whale-fall literature to identify and statistically model trends relevant to human forensics. Results from studies using deep-sea cameras baited with pig carcasses and simulated carrion provided further validation of noted trends. The stages of whale carcass decomposition most relevant to human forensics are those characterised by mobile scavengers that strip the soft tissues from carcasses, and to a lesser degree, other biota that degrade skeletal material. Our statistical models used the number of faunal taxa attracted to the whale carcasses as a measure of the ecological response and the potential rate of decomposition. Negative binomial models identified significant influences of carcass age and dissolved oxygen concentration on the ecological response (taxon numbers). The strongest environmental effects were identified in data from experimental studies that implanted whale carcasses across a broad range of dissolved-oxygen conditions. We propose directions for further experimental research to refine models of environmental controls on decomposition in the deep sea. Our results also highlight the potential use of publicly available global databases on environmental conditions in the deep ocean for informing body scavenging activity and thus body survival.

Detailed clinical data, including factors associated with recovery, are lacking, hampering prediction modelling and targeted therapeutic interventions. In a UK-wide cross-sectional surveillance study of adult hospitalized patients during the first COVID-19 wave, with multi-professional input from general and sub-specialty neurologists, psychiatrists, stroke physicians, and intensivists, we captured detailed data on demographics, risk factors, pre-COVID-19 Rockwood frailty score, comorbidities, neurological presentation and outcome. A priori clinical case definitions were used, with cross-specialty independent adjudication for discrepant cases. Multivariable logistic regression was performed using demographic and clinical variables, to determine the factors associated with outcome. A total of 267 cases were included. Cerebrovascular events were most frequently reported (131, 49%), followed by other central disorders (95, 36%) including delirium (28, 11%), central inflammatory (25, 9%), psychiatric (25, 9%), and other encephalopathies (17, 7%), including a severe encephalopathy (n\u2009=\u200913) not meeting delirium criteria; and peripheral nerve disorders (41, 15%). Those with the severe encephalopathy, in comparison to delirium, were younger, had higher rates of admission to intensive care and a longer duration of ventilation. Compared to normative data during the equivalent time period prior to the pandemic, cases of stroke in association with COVID-19 were younger and had a greater number of conventional, modifiable cerebrovascular risk factors. Twenty-seven per cent of strokes occurred in patients <60\u2009years. Relative to those >60\u2009years old, the younger stroke patients presented with delayed onset from respiratory symptoms, higher rates of multi-vessel occlusion (31%) and systemic thrombotic events. Clinical outcomes varied between disease groups, with cerebrovascular disease conferring the worst prognosis, but this effect was less marked than the pre-morbid factors of older age and a higher pre-COVID-19 frailty score, and a high admission white cell count, which were independently associated with a poor outcome. In summary, this study describes the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with COVID-19. In addition, we identify a severe COVID-19 encephalopathy atypical for delirium, and a phenotype of COVID-19 associated stroke in younger adults with a tendency for multiple infarcts and systemic thromboses.

TGIF1 is expressed in the two principal ovarian somatic cell populations: the cortex and the pre-granulosa cells of the medulla. TGIF1 expression is associated with an ovarian phenotype in estrogen-mediated sex reversal experiments. Targeted misexpression and gene knockdown indicate that TGIF1 is required, but not sufficient, for proper ovarian cortex formation. In addition, TGIF1 is identified as the first known regulator of juxtacortical medulla development. These findings provide new insights into chicken ovarian differentiation and development, specifically cortical and juxtacortical medulla formation.", "Keywords": ["Chicken embryo", "Gonadal development", "Juxtacortical medulla", "Ovarian cortex", "Sex determination", "TGIF1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Chick Embryo", "Chickens", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Genes, Homeobox", "Gonads", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Male", "Ovary", "Repressor Proteins", "Sertoli Cells", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Differentiation", "Testis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin Andres", "Last Name": "Estermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Claire Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Hirst", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew Thomas", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig Allen", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton VIC 3800, Australia."}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2021Aug15"}, {"PMID": "34370983", "Title": "Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiac Surgery.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Pandemics", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, 177 Fort Washington Ave, New York, NY 10032.

AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students' experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills.

In contrast, optimistic appraisals (particularly of high accommodation-focused coping potential and the ability to meet one's physical needs), use of problem-focused coping strategies (especially problem-solving) and accommodative coping strategies (especially positive reappraisal and self-encouragement) were associated with relatively positive outcomes.

Current estimates suggest that agriculture contributes ~30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additionally, there is an increased demand for animal protein, the production of which is particularly polluting. Therefore, the climate-disrupting potential of feeding the planet is likely to substantially worsen in the future. Due to the nutritional value of animal-based protein, it is not a simple solution to recommend a wholesale reduction in production/consumption of animal proteins. Rather, employing strategies which result in the production of low carbon animal protein may be part of the solution to reduce the GHGs associated with our diets without compromising diet quality. We suggest that farmed mussels may present a partial solution to this dilemma. Mussel production has a relatively low GHG production and does not put undue pressure on land or fresh water supplies. By drawing comparisons to other protein sources using the Australian Food and Nutrient Database and other published data, we demonstrate that they are a sustainable source of high-quality protein, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, and other key micronutrients such as B-12 and iron.

Penetrating the olfactory mucosa, the brain-eating amoeba travels along the olfactory nerves, burrowing through the cribriform plate to its destination: the brain's frontal lobes. The amoeba thrives in warm, freshwater environments, with peak infection rates in the summer months and has a mortality rate of approximately 97%. A major contributor to the pathogen's high mortality is the lack of sensitivity of N. fowleri to current drug therapies, even in the face of combination-drug therapy. To enable rational drug discovery and design efforts we have pursued protein production and crystallography-based structure determination efforts for likely drug targets from N. fowleri. The genes were selected if they had homology to drug targets listed in Drug Bank or were nominated by primary investigators engaged in N. fowleri research. In 2017, 178 N. fowleri protein targets were queued to the Seattle Structural Genomics Center of Infectious Disease (SSGCID) pipeline, and to date 89 soluble recombinant proteins and 19 unique target structures have been produced. Many of the new protein structures are potential drug targets and contain structural differences compared to their human homologs, which could allow for the development of pathogen-specific inhibitors. Five of the structures were analyzed in more detail, and four of five show promise that selective inhibitors of the active site could be found. The 19 solved crystal structures build a foundation for future work in combating this devastating disease by encouraging further investigation to stimulate drug discovery for this neglected

The rete therefore forms an essential bridging system between the testis and excurrent ducts. Yet the embryonic origin and molecular regulation of rete testis development is poorly understood. This review examines the anatomy, endocrine control, and development of the mammalian rete testis, focusing on recent findings on its molecular regulation, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and identifying areas for future research. The rete testis develops in close association with Sertoli cells of the seminiferous cords, although unique molecular markers are sparce. Most recently, modern molecular approaches such as global RNA-seq have revealed the transcriptional signature of rete cell precursors, pointing to at least a partial common origin with Sertoli cells. In the mouse, genes involved in Sertoli cell development or maintenance, such as Sox9, Wt1, Sf1, and Dmrt1, are also expressed in cells of the rete system. Rete progenitor cells also express unique markers, such as Pax8, E-cadherin, and keratin 8. These must directly or indirectly regulate the physical joining of testis tubules to the efferent duct system and confer other physiological functions of the rete.

A retrospective review identified 134 patients with a BAV-associated root aneurysm who underwent VSRR (n\u202f=\u202f65) or BB (n\u202f=\u202f69) from 2005 to 2019. Patients with aortic stenosis, endocarditis, previous aortic valve replacement, and emergent cases were excluded. Propensity-score matching was performed, resulting in 2 risk-adjusted groups (n\u202f=\u202f40 per group). Median follow-up was 6.21 (1.43-8.28) years. The VSRR cohort was younger (46.0 years vs 56.0 years, P < 0.001) and had a lower incidence of at least moderate aortic insufficiency (AI) (78.5% vs 92.8%, P = 0.02).

RXFP3 is expressed widely throughout the brain, including the hypothalamus, where it has been shown to modulate feeding behavior and neuroendocrine activity in rodents. In order to better characterize its potential mechanisms of action, this study determined whether RXFP3 is expressed by dopaminergic neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), in addition to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurons that express RXFP3 were visualized in coronal brain sections from RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice, which express the tdTomato fluorophore within RXFP3-positive cells, and dopaminergic neurons in these areas were visualized by simultaneous immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Approximately 20% of ARC neurons containing TH-IR coexpressed tdTomato fluorescence, suggesting that RXFP3 can influence the dopamine pathway from the ARC to the pituitary gland that controls prolactin release. The ability of prolactin to reduce leptin sensitivity and increase food consumption therefore represents a potential mechanism by which RXFP3 activation influences feeding. A similar proportion of DMH neurons containing TH-IR expressed RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence, consistent with a possible RXFP3-mediated regulation of stress and neuroendocrine circuits. In contrast, RXFP3 was barely detected within the VTA. TdTomato signal was absent from the ARC and DMH in sections from Rosa26-tdTomato mice, suggesting that the cells identified in RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice expressed authentic RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence. Together, these findings identify potential hypothalamic mechanisms through which RXFP3 influences neuroendocrine control of metabolism, and further highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting RXFP3 in feeding-related disorders.", "Keywords": ["RXFP3", "arcuate nucleus", "dopamine", "dorsomedial hypothalamus", "relaxin-3", "tyrosine hydroxylase"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lara M", "Last Name": "Voglsanger", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Read", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sarah S", "Last Name": "Ch'ng", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Cary", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Izel M", "Last Name": "Eraslan", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leni R", "Last Name": "Rivera", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Lee D", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Exercise and Nutritional Science, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew L", "Last Name": "Gundlach", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Institute for Innovation in Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, VIC, Australia."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33442887", "Title": "The Sertoli cell expressed gene secernin-1 (Scrn1) is dispensable for male fertility in the mouse.", "Abstract": "Male infertility is a prevalent clinical presentation for which there is likely a strong genetic component due to the thousands of genes required for spermatogenesis.

The principle molecular and cellular processes that underlie development of the vertebrate limb are well characterized. However, how these processes are altered to drive differential limb development between vertebrates is less well understood. Several vertebrate models are being utilized to determine the developmental basis of differential limb morphogenesis, though these typically focus on later patterning of the established limb bud and may not represent the complete developmental trajectory. Particularly, heterochronic limb development can occur prior to limb outgrowth and patterning but receives little attention. This review summarizes the genetic regulation of vertebrate forelimb diversity, with particular focus on wing reduction in the flightless emu as a model for examining limb heterochrony. These studies highlight that wing reduction is complex, with heterochronic cellular and genetic events influencing the major stages of limb development.

Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of 'scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade.

This abyssal (>4000 m depth) region hosts major deposits of polymetallic nodules targeted for future seabed mining, an activity that would destroy these highly diverse and delicate protists, particularly those living on the nodules themselves. Since the cell occupies only a small proportion of their test volume, xenophyophores may make a fairly modest contribution to benthic biomass and carbon cycling. Nevertheless, xenophyophore tests can passively enhance particle deposition, concentrate food, and provide habitat structure utilized by diverse organisms. Their destruction could therefore influence the recovery of benthic communities. Species requiring nodule substrates will likely not recover, since nodules take millions of years to form. However, xenophyophores can grow quickly and colonize extensive volcanic ash deposits within years, suggesting that sediment-dwelling species could be among the first large immobile organisms to reappear in mining-impacted areas.", "Keywords": ["Xenophyophores", "ecosystem recovery", "foraminifera", "habitat heterogeneity", "polymetallic nodules"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Gooday", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Durden", "Affiliation": "National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawai'i at Ma\u00f1oa, Honolulu, HI, USA."}], "Journal": "Communicative & integrative biology", "PubDate": "2020Nov25"}, {"PMID": "33280547", "Title": "External Validation of Five Scores to Predict Stroke-Associated Pneumonia and the Role of Selected Blood Biomarkers.", "Abstract": "Several clinical scoring systems as well as biomarkers have been proposed to predict stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP).

Healthy participants (n = 25) were randomly allocated to receive vermis, unilateral hemisphere or sham 10 Hz cerebellar rTMS. Recordings were made using pharyngeal electromyography and manometry catheters, obtaining motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and pressure recordings. The amplitudes of MEPs elicited using single-pulse TMS delivered to the pharyngeal areas of the motor cortex bilaterally were measured pre- and post-cerebellar stimulation. As in previous studies, abductor policis brevis (APB) MEPs were measured to assess post-rTMS modulation specificity. Swallowing was assessed using a swallowing accuracy task. Measurements were made at baseline and 15-min intervals for an hour post-intervention. Measurements involved TMS being used to elicit 10 MEPs bilaterally over the pharyngeal areas of the motor cortex, over the APB cortical representation adjacent to the pharyngeal area with the lowest resting motor threshold and 5 MEPs bilaterally over pharyngeal areas of the cerebellar hemispheres. Swallowing accuracy was assessed by giving participants 10 attempts to swallow and hit a digital target. Cerebellar vermis rTMS caused significant suppression of cortical pharyngeal MEP amplitudes compared with unilateral rTMS and sham (P = 0.0005, 0.002). APB and cerebellar MEP amplitudes were unaffected as were pharyngeal and APB MEP latencies. Following cerebellar vermis rTMS there was a significant reduction in swallowing accuracy compared with sham (P = 0.001).

Such studies are also providing new information on gonadal maturation, ageing and the somatic-germ cell niche. Furthermore, they have the potential to improve our understanding and diagnosis of Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSDs). DSDs occur when chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex are atypical. Despite major advances in recent years, most cases of DSD still cannot be explained at the molecular level. This presents a major pediatric concern. The emergence of single-cell genomics and transcriptomics now presents a novel avenue for DSD analysis, for both diagnosis and for understanding the molecular genetic etiology.

This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes.

Spindle input, in turn, depends upon the physiological and mechanical properties of surrounding muscle tissue. Altering these properties could affect ankle proprioception, with potential consequences for balance. Here we determine the effects of prior muscle cooling, stretch and contraction upon performance of a contralateral ankle joint matching task. Participants stood passively leaning against a board oriented 22\u00b0 rearward from vertical. Their right ankle was rotated to a randomised position between \u00b1 6\u00b0 plantar/dorsiflexion. The task was to align the left ankle to the same position, without vision. In the first experiment, immediately prior to each testing session, participants either produced a strong calf muscle contraction in a fully plantarflexed (tiptoe) posture or underwent 15\u00b0 dorsiflexion stretch. Contraction had no effect on task performance, whereas stretch produced a significant bias in ankle placement of 0.89 \u00b1 0.6\u00b0, indicating that participants perceived their foot to be more plantarflexed compared to a control condition. In the second experiment, the right lower leg was cooled in iced water (\u2264 5\u00b0C) for 10 minutes. Cooling increased joint matching error by ~0.4\u00b0, through a combination of increased bias and variability. These results confirm that conditioning the triceps surae muscles can alter perception of ankle joint position. Since body movement during quiet stance is in the order of 1\u00b0, the magnitude of these changes are relevant for balance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Ankle", "Feedback, Physiological", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Proprioception", "Skin Temperature", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Raymond F", "Last Name": "Reynolds", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Craig P", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Rufei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Dunn", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "McAllister", "Affiliation": "The School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32863191", "Title": "Post-Myocardial Infarction Complications During the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Case Series.", "Abstract": "We report 4 cases of post myocardial infarction complications due to the delay in presentation during COVID-19 era.

They are the largest mammals capable of powered flight, and are highly mobile, which makes them key seed and pollen dispersers in forest ecosystems. However, their mobility also facilitates transmission of zoonotic diseases and brings them in conflict with humans, and so they require a precarious balancing of conservation and management concerns throughout their Old World range.

We used a high-resolution hydrodynamic model and particle-tracking model to explore the dispersal of simulated larvae in a hydrographically complex region of fjords on the West Antarctic Peninsula. Modeled larvae represented two end members of dispersal potential observed in Antarctic benthos resulting from differing developmental periods and swimming behavior. For simulations of low dispersing larvae (pre-competency period = 8\u2009days, settlement period = 15\u2009days, swimming downward) self-recruitment within fjords was important, with no larval settlement occurring in adjacent fjords <50\u2009km apart. For simulations of highly dispersing organisms (pre-competency period = 35-120\u2009days, settlement period = 30-115\u2009days, no swimming behavior), dispersal between fjords occurred when larvae were in the water column for at least 35\u2009days, but settlement was rarely successful even for larvae spending up to 150\u2009days in the plankton. The lack of ecological connectivity between fjords within a single spawning event suggests that these fjords harbor ecologically distinct populations in which self-recruitment may maintain populations, and genetic connectivity between fjords is likely achieved through stepping-stone dispersal. Export of larvae from natal fjord populations to the broader shelf region (>100\u2009km distance) occurred within surface layers (<100\u2009m depth) and was enhanced by episodic katabatic wind events that may be common in glaciomarine fjords worldwide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antarctic Regions", "Ecosystem", "Estuaries", "Hydrodynamics", "Larva"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda F", "Last Name": "Ziegler", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Hahn-Woernle", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA."}], "Journal": "Integrative and comparative biology", "PubDate": "2020Dec16"}, {"PMID": "32610199", "Title": "A Beautiful Bunch of Apples.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Malus", "Mitral Valve", "Robotic Surgical Procedures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University, Columbia University Irving Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.

Fifteen gait measures were computed from the sensor data and tested for between-session reliability, for differences between controls and people with moderate and severe MS disability, and for correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The majority of gait measures showed good to excellent between-session reliability when assessed in a subgroup of 23 healthy controls and 25 people with MS. These measures showed that people with MS walked with significantly longer step and stride durations, reduced step and stride regularity, and experienced difficulties in controlling and maintaining a stable walk when compared to controls. These abnormalities significantly increased in people with a higher level of disability and correlated with their EDSS scores. Reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers using wearable sensors have been identified.

These diverse and remote deep-sea communities are critically under-sampled and increasingly threatened by anthropogenic impacts, including future polymetallic nodule mining. Using a multigene environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach, we characterized metazoan communities sampled from sediments, polymetallic nodules and seawater in the western Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) to test the hypotheses that deep seamounts (a) are species richness hotspots in the abyss, (b) have structurally distinct communities in comparison to other deep-sea habitats, and (c) that seafloor particulate organic carbon (POC) flux and polymetallic nodule density are positively correlated with metazoan diversity. eDNA metabarcoding was effective at characterizing distinct biotas known to occur in association with different abyssal substrate types (e.g., nodule- and sediment-specific fauna), with distinct community composition and few taxa shared across substrates. Seamount faunas had higher overall taxonomic richness, and different community composition and biogeography than adjacent abyssal plains, with seamount communities displaying less connectivity between regions than comparable assemblages on the abyssal plains. Across an estimated gradient of low to moderate POC flux, we find lowest taxon richness at the lowest POC flux, as well as an effect of nodule size on community composition. Our results suggest that while abyssal seamounts are important reservoirs of metazoan diversity in the CCZ, given limited taxonomic overlap between seamount and plains fauna, conservation of seamount assemblages will be insufficient to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function in regions targeted for mining.", "Keywords": ["CCZ", "abyssal plains", "deep sea mining", "meiofauna", "metabarcoding", "polymetallic nodules"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "DNA, Environmental", "Ecosystem", "Invertebrates", "Mining"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Laroche", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Kersten", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Goetze", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, HI, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular ecology", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32445439", "Title": "Surgery Scheduling in a Crisis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Appointments and Schedules", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Critical Care", "Health Care Rationing", "Health Facility Size", "Hospital Administration", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "New York City", "Operating Rooms", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "Surgery Department, Hospital", "Triage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Argenziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Fischkoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "PubDate": "2020Jun04"}, {"PMID": "32388554", "Title": "Validation of the Health-Related Felt Stigma and Concealment Questionnaire.", "Abstract": "Stigma is associated with many health conditions, including chronic pain.

the genetic triggers for gonadal sex differentiation vary across species, the cell biology of gonadal development was long thought to be largely conserved. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gonadal sex differentiation, using single-cell sequencing in the embryonic chicken gonad during sexual differentiation. The data show that chicken embryonic-supporting cells do not derive from the coelomic epithelium, in contrast to other vertebrates studied. Instead, they derive from a DMRT1+/PAX2+/WNT4+/OSR1+ mesenchymal cell population. We find a greater complexity of gonadal cell types than previously thought, including the identification of two distinct sub-populations of Sertoli cells in developing testes and derivation of embryonic steroidogenic cells from a differentiated supporting-cell lineage. Altogether, these results indicate that, just as the genetic trigger for sex differs across vertebrate groups, cell lineage specification in the gonad may also vary substantially.", "Keywords": ["DMRT1", "PAX2", "chicken", "embryonic gonad", "gonadal sex differentiation", "ovary", "sex determination", "single-cell RNA-seq", "testis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Chick Embryo", "Chickens", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gonads", "Male", "Ovary", "Sertoli Cells", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Differentiation", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Testis", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin Andres", "Last Name": "Estermann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Monash Bioinformatics Platform, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Claire Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Hirst", "Affiliation": "Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute (ARMI), Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Zahida Yesmin", "Last Name": "Roly", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Serralbo", "Affiliation": "Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute (ARMI), Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Deepak", "Last Name": "Adhikari", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "Monash Bioinformatics Platform, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew Thomas", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig Allen", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia.

Steady-state levels of mature oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein complexes were increased by PioG + dNs treatment in CON cybrids, but were unchanged in MUT cybrids. However, treatment was able to significantly increase maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and cell respiratory control ratios in both CON and MUT cybrids.

Unilateral cerebellar repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) excites corticobulbar motor pathways to the pharynx but the effects of bilateral versus unilateral cerebellar rTMS on these pathways are unknown. In this three-part cross-over study, healthy participants (n\u2009=\u200913) were randomly allocated to receive unilateral or bilateral 10\u00a0Hz cerebellar rTMS. Participants were intubated with pharyngeal electromyography and/or manometry catheters for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and pressure recordings. In part 1 of the study, single pulse TMS was used to measure baseline motor cortical pharyngeal MEP (PMEP) and hemispheric cerebellar MEP (CMEP) amplitudes, before cerebellar rTMS was administered. Repeat measures of PMEP amplitude were performed at 15-min intervals for an hour post unilateral and bilateral rTMS. Thereafter, in two further studies, a cortical 'virtual lesion' (V/L) was applied prior to cerebellar rTMS with pre and post PMEPs (part 2) and measurements of swallowing accuracy (part 3) using a behavioural task. Compared to baseline, unilateral and bilateral cerebellar rTMS provoked increases in pharyngeal cortical excitation (P\u2009=\u20090.028, 0.0005, respectively). Bilateral rTMS was significantly more effective than unilateral in causing cortical excitation (P\u2009=\u20090.0005) and in reversing the suppressive neurological (P\u2009=\u20090.0005) and behavioural (P\u2009=\u20090.0005) effects of a cortical V/L.

Our ability to preserve both benthic and pelagic deep-sea ecosystems depends upon effective ecosystem-based management strategies and monitoring based on widely agreed deep-sea ecological variables. Here, we identify a set of deep-sea essential ecological variables among five scientific areas of the deep ocean: (1) biodiversity; (2) ecosystem functions; (3) impacts and risk assessment; (4) climate change, adaptation and evolution; and (5) ecosystem conservation. Conducting an expert elicitation (1,155 deep-sea scientists consulted and 112 respondents), our analysis indicates a wide consensus amongst deep-sea experts that monitoring should prioritize large organisms (that is, macro- and megafauna) living in deep waters and in benthic habitats, whereas monitoring of ecosystem functioning should focus on trophic structure and biomass production. Habitat degradation and recovery rates are identified as crucial features for monitoring deep-sea ecosystem health, while global climate change will likely shift bathymetric distributions and cause local extinction in deep-sea species. Finally, deep-sea conservation efforts should focus primarily on vulnerable marine ecosystems and habitat-forming species.

While the molecular and endocrine control of duct regression in males have been well studied, early development of the ducts in both sexes is less well understood. Here, we describe a novel role for the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor, GPR56, in development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts in the chicken embryo. GPR56 is expressed in the ducts of both sexes from early stages. The mRNA is present during the elongation phase of duct formation, and it is restricted to the inner M\u00fcllerian duct epithelium. The putative ligand, Collagen III, is abundantly expressed in the M\u00fcllerian duct at the same developmental stages. Knockdown of GPR56 expression using in ovo electroporation results in variably truncated ducts, with a loss of expression of both epithelial and mesenchymal markers of duct development. Over-expression of GPR56 in vitro results in enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration.

A novel suite of parasitic copepods and worms were sampled, from families that are known to associate with other benthic invertebrates or demersal fishes as hosts. Larval assemblages were patchily distributed at the mesoscale, with little similarity in OTUs detected among deployments even within the same 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0km study area. Our results provide baseline observations on larval diversity prior to polymetallic nodule mining in this region, and emphasize our overwhelming lack of knowledge regarding larvae of the benthic boundary layer in abyssal plain ecosystems.", "Keywords": ["Benthic Boundary Layer (BBL)", "Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ)", "Deep sea", "Larval dispersal", "Metabarcoding", "Polymetallic nodule mining"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Kersten", "Affiliation": "Hawaii Pacific University, Kaneohe, HI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Eric W", "Last Name": "Vetter", "Affiliation": "Hawaii Pacific University, Kaneohe, HI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michelle J", "Last Name": "Jungbluth", "Affiliation": "Hawaii Pacific University, Kaneohe, HI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Goetze", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PeerJ", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31577923", "Title": "Health Status After Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.", "Abstract": "In patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at low surgical risk, treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) results in lower rates of death, stroke, and rehospitalization at 1 year compared with surgical aortic valve replacement; however, the effect of treatment strategy on health status is unknown.", "Keywords": ["low surgical risk", "quality of life", "transcatheter aortic valve replacement"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aortic Valve", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Echocardiography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Status", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Severity of Illness Index", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suzanne J", "Last Name": "Baron", "Affiliation": "Lahey Hospital and Medical Center, Burlington, Massachusetts; Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.

Studies in humans and mice indicate that the main role of FOXL2 is in the postnatal ovary, namely folliculogenesis. To shed light on the function and evolution of FOXL2 in the female gonad, we examined its role in embryonic avian gonads, using in ovo over-expression and knockdown. FOXL2 mRNA and protein are expressed female-specifically in the embryonic chicken gonad, just prior to the onset of sexual differentiation. FOXL2 is expressed in the medullary cord cells, in the same cell type as aromatase (CYP19A1). In addition, later in development, expression also becomes localised in a subset of cortical cells, distinct from those expressing estrogen receptor alpha. Mis-expression of FOXL2 in the male chicken embryonic gonad suppresses the testis developmental pathway, abolishing local expression of the male pathway genes, SOX9, DMRT1 and AMH, and repressing Sertoli cell development. Conversely, knockdown of FOXL2 expression allows ectopic activation of SOX9 in female gonads. However, mis-expression of FOXL2 alone was insufficient to activate aromatase expression in male gonads, while FOXL2 knockdown did not affect aromatase expression in females. These results indicate that FOXL2 plays an important role in embryonic differentiation of the avian ovary via antagonism of SOX9, but may be dispensable for aromatase activation at embryonic stages. The data suggest that FOXL2 has different roles in different species, more central for embryonic ovarian differentiation in egg-laying vertebrates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew Thomas", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "A Major, Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Katie", "Last Name": "Ayers", "Affiliation": "K Ayers, Molecualr Genetics, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Parkville, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Chue", "Affiliation": "J Chue, Molecular Development, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Parkville, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Roeszler", "Affiliation": "K Roeszler, Molecular Development, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Parkville, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "C Smith, Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, 3800, Australia."}], "Journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "PubDate": "2019Sep01"}, {"PMID": "31493447", "Title": "Modulation of high fat diet-induced microbiome changes, but not behaviour, by minocycline.", "Abstract": "An emerging novel therapeutic agent for major depressive disorder, minocycline, has the potential to influence both gut microbiome and inflammatory status.

There is insufficient evidence to justify screening for aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Prophylactic antibiotics did not prevent SAP and proton pump inhibitors may increase risk. Treatment with metoclopramide may reduce SAP risk. Evidence that nasogastric tube (NGT) placement increases risk of SAP is equivocal.

In mice, previous conditional knockout studies suggested distinct roles for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling at different stages of osteogenesis and a role for FGFR2 in osteoblast maturation. However, the potential for redundancy among FGFRs and the mechanisms and consequences of stage-specific osteoblast lineage regulation were not addressed. Here, we conditionally inactivate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in mature osteoblasts with an Osteocalcin (OC)-Cre or Dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1)-CreER driver. We find that young mice lacking both receptors or only FGFR1 are phenotypically normal. However, between 6 and 12 weeks of age, OC-Cre Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double- and Fgfr1 single-conditional knockout mice develop a high bone mass phenotype with increased periosteal apposition, increased and disorganized endocortical bone with increased porosity, and biomechanical properties that reflect increased bone mass but impaired material properties. Histopathological and gene expression analyses show that this phenotype is preceded by a striking loss of osteocytes and accompanied by activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. These data identify a role for FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes that is directly or indirectly required for osteocyte survival and regulation of bone mass during postnatal bone growth. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["APOPTOSIS", "FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTORS", "MOLECULAR PATHWAYS-REMODELING", "OSTEOBLASTS", "OSTEOCYTES"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bone Development", "Bone Remodeling", "Cell Death", "Cell Survival", "Cortical Bone", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Organ Size", "Osteoblasts", "Osteocytes", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "McKenzie", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kannan", "Last Name": "Karuppaiah", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Langberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Ornitz", "Affiliation": "Musculoskeletal Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2019Sep"}, {"PMID": "31156537", "Title": "Antibiotic Class and Outcome in Post-stroke Infections: An Individual Participant Data Pooled Analysis of VISTA-Acute.", "Abstract": "Introduction: Antibiotics used to treat post-stroke infections have differing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Our aim was to investigate whether antibiotic class was associated with outcome after post-stroke infection. Methods: We analyzed pooled individual participant data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA)-Acute. Patients with ischemic stroke and with an infection treated with systemic antibiotic therapy during the first 2 weeks after stroke onset were eligible. Antibiotics were grouped into eight classes, according to antimicrobial mechanism and prevalence. The primary analysis investigated whether antibiotic class for any infection, or for pneumonia, was independently associated with a shift in 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using ordinal logistic regression. Results: 2,708 patients were eligible (median age [IQR] = 74 [65 to 80] y; 51% female; median [IQR] NIHSS score = 15 [11 to 19]). Pneumonia occurred in 35%. Treatment with macrolides (5% of any infections; 9% of pneumonias) was independently associated with more favorable mRS distribution for any infection [OR (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.42 to 0.83), p = 0.004] and for pneumonia [OR (95% CI) = 0.46 (0.29 to 0.73), p = 0.001]. Unfavorable mRS distribution was independently associated with treatment of any infection either with carbapenems, cephalosporins or monobactams [OR (95% CI) = 1.62 (1.33 to 1.97), p < 0.001], penicillin plus \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors [OR (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.03 to 1.54), p = 0.025] or with aminoglycosides [OR (95% CI) = 1.73 (1.22 to 2.46), p = 0.002].

SAP was defined as pneumonia occurring within 7\u00a0days of admission by the treating clinicians. Mutlivariable regression models were constructed to assess factors influencing survival and the level of disability at discharge using modified Rankin Scale [mRS]. Mean (SD) age was 83.0 (8.7) years and ischaemic stroke occurred in 727 (85.0%). Mortality was 19.0% at 30\u00a0days and 44.0% at 6\u00a0months.

However, the neurochemical phenotype and connectivity of BNST RXFP3-expressing (RXFP3+) cells have yet to be elucidated. We interrogated the molecular signature and electrophysiological properties of BNST RXFP3+ neurons using a RXFP3-Cre reporter mouse line. BNST RXFP3+ cells are circumscribed to the dorsal BNST (dBNST) and are neurochemically heterogeneous, comprising a mix of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ~48% of BNST RXFP3+ neurons are GABAergic, and a quarter of these co-express the calcium-binding protein, calbindin. A subset of BNST RXFP3+ cells (~41%) co-express CaMKII\u03b1, suggesting this subpopulation of BNST RXFP3+ neurons are excitatory. Corroborating this, RNAscope\u00ae revealed that ~35% of BNST RXFP3+ cells express vVGluT2 mRNA, indicating a subpopulation of RXFP3+ neurons are glutamatergic. RXFP3+ neurons show direct hyperpolarization to bath application of a selective RXFP3 agonist, RXFP3-A2, while around 50% of cells were depolarised by exogenous corticotrophin releasing factor. In behaviorally naive mice the majority of RXFP3+ neurons were Type II cells exhibiting Ih and T type calcium mediated currents. However, chronic swim stress caused persistent plasticity, decreasing the proportion of neurons that express these channels. These studies are the first to characterize the BNST RXFP3 system in mouse and lay the foundation for future functional studies appraising the role of the murine BNST RXFP3 system in more complex behaviors.", "Keywords": ["RRID:AB_141607", "RRID:AB_141637", "RRID:AB_141844", "RRID:AB_142672", "RRID:AB_2336132", "RRID:AB_2340375", "RRID:AB_2536183", "RRID:AB_2619710", "RRID:AB_300798", "RRID:AB_309787", "RRID:AB_477329", "RRID:AB_477652", "RRID:AB_634520", "RRID:AB_887883", "RRID:IMSR_JAX:007914", "RRID:MMRRC_036667-UCD", "RXFP3", "bed nucleus of the stria terminalis", "corticotropin-releasing factor", "relaxin-3", "stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calbindins", "Calcium", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Female", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neural Inhibition", "Neurons", "RNA, Messenger", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Septal Nuclei", "Stress, Psychological", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah S", "Last Name": "Ch'ng", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Robyn M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mohammed Akhter", "Last Name": "Hossain", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stuart J", "Last Name": "McDougall", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}], "Journal": "The Journal of comparative neurology", "PubDate": "2019Nov01"}, {"PMID": "30946294", "Title": "PICU-Based Rehabilitation and Outcomes Assessment: A Survey of Pediatric Critical Care Physicians.", "Abstract": "Characterize current practices for PICU-based rehabilitation, and physician perceptions and attitudes, barriers, resources, and outcome assessment in contemporary PICU settings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Critical Care", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Physicians", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Rehabilitation", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amery", "Last Name": "Treble-Barna", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Sue R", "Last Name": "Beers", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Amy J", "Last Name": "Houtrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Ortiz-Aguayo", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Valenta", "Affiliation": "Professional Practice and Education Division, Jefferson Hospital, Jefferson Hills, PA."}, {"First Name": "Meg", "Last Name": "Stanger", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Maddie", "Last Name": "Chrisman", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Maxine", "Last Name": "Orringer", "Affiliation": "Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care, Ann & Robert H.

Although the role of the megalin-cubilin receptor complex (MCRC) in this process is unequivocal, modalities independent of this complex are evident but as yet undefined. Here, using immunostaining and Tf-flux assays, FACS analysis, and fluorescence imaging, we report localization of Tf receptor 1 (TfR1), the cognate Tf receptor mediating cellular holo-Tf (hTf) acquisition, to the apical brush border of the PT, with expression gradually declining along the PT in mouse and rat kidneys. In functional studies, hTf uptake across the apical membrane of cultured PT epithelial cell (PTEC) monolayers increased in response to decreased cellular iron after desferrioxamine (DFO) treatment. We also found that apical hTf uptake under basal conditions is receptor-associated protein (RAP)-sensitive and therefore mediated by the MCRC but becomes RAP-insensitive under DFO treatment, with concomitantly decreased megalin and cubilin expression levels and increased TfR1 expression. Thus, as well as the MCRC, TfR1 mediates hTf uptake across the PT apical brush border, but in conditions of decreased cellular iron, hTf uptake is predominated by augmented apical TfR1. In conclusion, both the MCRC and TfR1 mediate hTf uptake across apical brush border membranes of PTECs and reciprocally respond to decreased cellular iron. Our findings have implications for renal health, whole-body iron homeostasis, and pathologies arising from disrupted iron balance.", "Keywords": ["chelation", "cubilin", "endocytosis", "epithelial cell", "iron", "kidney", "megalin", "membrane transport", "renal physiology", "transferrin", "transferrin receptor"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Iron", "Kidney Tubules, Proximal", "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred WKY", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Receptors, Transferrin", "Transferrin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig P", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "From the School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom, craig.smith@manchester.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Wing-Kee", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Physiology, Pathophysiology and Toxicology, University of Witten/Herdecke, D-58453 Witten, Germany, and."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Haley", "Affiliation": "From the School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "S\u00f8ren B", "Last Name": "Poulsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000 Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Th\u00e9venod", "Affiliation": "Physiology, Pathophysiology and Toxicology, University of Witten/Herdecke, D-58453 Witten, Germany, and."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Fenton", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000 Denmark."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2019Apr26"}, {"PMID": "30819294", "Title": "Nissen Fundoplication-Preserving Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.", "Abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is significantly more prevalent in obese patients. Nissen fundoplication alleviates symptoms in those refractory to dietary changes and optimal medical management. The need for concomitant treatment of GERD and obesity is becoming more prevalent. The objective of this study was to determine whether Nissen-preserving laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a safe and effective weight loss option for patients with pre-existing Nissen fundoplication. The study was conducted at the Hospital Corporation of America, Memorial Health, Savannah, Georgia, academic institution. We retrospectively reviewed five patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen-preserving SG between 2011 and 2017. We compared pre- and postoperative subjective GERD symptoms, occurrence of any immediate postoperative complications, change in BMI, and excess weight loss. Of the five patients, four were female and one was male. The mean age was 50.6 years. The mean preoperative BMI was 44.8 \u00b1 5.4, one-month postoperative BMI was 41.2 \u00b1 6.1 (P < 0.001), and six-month postoperative BMI was 37.5 \u00b1 8.1 (P < 0.009), with mean excess weight loss at six months of 33.9 \u00b1 23 per cent. There were no immediate postoperative complications. Subjective GERD symptoms were unchanged in two patients and improved in the other three.

Association of functional screening tests and noncontact injuries in Division I women student-athletes. J Strength Cond Res 34(8): 2302-2311, 2020-To determine the association between functional screening tests and lower-body, noncontact injuries in Division I women basketball, soccer, and volleyball student-athletes (SA). Sixty-eight injury-free women SA (age: 19.1 \u00b1 1.1 years, height: 171.3 \u00b1 8.7 cm, and mass: 68.4 \u00b1 9.5 kg) were tested preseason with single hop (SH), triple hop (TH), and crossover hop (XH) for distance, and isometric hip strength (abduction, extension, and external rotation) in randomized order. The first lower-body (spine and lower extremity), noncontact injury requiring intervention by the athletic trainer was abstracted from the electronic medical record. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to determine cut-points for each hopping test from the absolute value of between-limb difference. Body mass-adjusted strength was categorized into tertiles. Logistic regression determined the odds of injury with each functional screening test using the hopping tests cut-points and strength categories, adjusting for previous injury. Fifty-two SA were injured during the sport season. The cut-point for SH was 4 cm (sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.43, and AUC = 0.53), and for TH and XH was 12 cm (sensitivity = 0.75 and 0.67, specificity = 0.71 and 0.57, AUC = 0.59 and 0.41, respectively). A statistically significant association with TH and injuries (adjusted odds ratio = 6.50 [95% confidence interval: 1.69-25.04]) was found. No significant overall association was found with SH or XH, nor with the strength tests. Using a clinically relevant injury definition, the TH showed the strongest predictive ability for noncontact injuries.

Methods A cost analysis was conducted from the Alberta Ministry of Health perspective with a 15-year horizon. Estimated costs were: PBT unit, facility development as part of an ongoing capital project, electricity, maintenance contract,\u00a0and staffing. Revenues were: savings from stopping USA referrals, avoiding the\u00a0costs of standard radiation therapy (RT) for Albertans receiving PBT instead, and cost-recovery charges for out-of-province patients. Results The Ministry of Health funded 15 Albertans for PBT in the USA in the 2014/15 fiscal year (mean CAD$ 237,348/patient). A single-vault, compact PBT unit operating 10 hours/day could treat 250 patients annually. A 100 Albertans, with accepted indications, such as the curative-intent treatment of chordomas, ocular melanomas,\u00a0and selected pediatric cancers, would likely benefit annually from PBT's improved conformality and/or reduced integral dose compared to RT. The estimated capital cost was $40 million for a single beamline built within an ongoing capital project. Operating costs were $4.8 million/year at capacity. With 50% capacity reserved for non-Albertans at a cost recovery of $45,000/patient, a Western Canadian PBT facility would achieve net positive cash flow by year eight of clinical operations, assuming Alberta-to-USA referrals reach 21 patients/year by 2024 and increase at 3%/year thereafter. Sensitivity analysis indicates the lifetime net savings is robust to the assumptions made.

Twelve patients had a two-stage conversion and 15 patients had a single-stage conversion. There were no surgical complications in either group. There was a significant reduction in BMI after conversion, starting at one month and continuing forward to 12 months. The average BMI reduction over the two-year follow-up period was 8.19.

Since P.\u00a0craigi is a very abundant encrusting sponge on nodules, understanding its genetic diversity and connectivity could provide important insights into extinction risks and design of marine protected areas. Our main aim was to assess the effectiveness of the Area of Particular Environmental Interest 6 (APEI-6) as a potential genetic reservoir for three adjacent mining exploration contract areas (UK-1A, UK-1B and OMS-1A). As in many other sponges, COI showed extremely low variability even for samples ~900\u00a0km apart. Conversely, the 168 individuals of P.\u00a0craigi, genotyped for 11 microsatellite markers, provided strong genetic structure at large geographical scales not explained by isolation by distance (IBD). Interestingly, we detected molecular affinities between samples from APEI-6 and UK-1A, despite being separated ~800\u00a0km. Although our migration analysis inferred very little progeny dispersal of individuals between areas, the major differentiation of OMS-1A from the other areas might be explained by the occurrence of predominantly northeasterly transport predicted by the HYCOM hydrodynamic model. Our study suggests that although APEI-6 does serve a conservation role, with species connectivity to the exploration areas, it is on its own inadequate as a propagule source for P.\u00a0craigi for the entire eastern portion of the CCZ.

Our findings suggest that the poriferan fauna of the eastern CCZ is both species rich and inadequately known, and that substantially more sampling and taxonomic studies of the CCZ sponge fauna are required to establish a megafaunal biogeography and evaluate potential extinction risks resulting from polymetallic-nodule mining.", "Keywords": ["Porifera, Hexactinellida, Rossellidae"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Pacific Ocean", "Porifera"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sascha", "Last Name": "Herzog", "Affiliation": "Senckenberg Research Institute and Nature Museum, Senckenberganlage 25, 60325 Frankfurt a.

Previous studies have identified a critical gene dosage effect of VegfA in embryonic development and vessel homeostasis, neovascularization, and tumor growth, and potent inhibitors of VEGFR2 have been used to treat a variety of cancers. Inhibition of FGFR signaling has also been considered as an antiangiogenic approach to treat a variety of cancers. Inhibition of VEGFR2 with neutralizing antibodies or with pharmacological inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinase domain has at least short-term efficacy with some cancers; however, also affects vessel homeostasis, leading to adverse complications. We investigate gene dosage effects of Vegfr2, Fgfr1, and Fgfr2 in three independent mouse models of tumorigenesis: two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis, and sub-cutaneous transplantation of B16F0 melanoma and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC). Mice heterozygous for Vegfr2 display profound defects in supporting tumor growth and angiogenesis. Unexpectedly, additional deletion of endothelial Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in Vegfr2 heterozygous mice shows similar tumor growth and angiogenesis as the Vegfr2 heterozygous mice. Notably, hematopoietic deletion of two alleles of Vegfr2 had minimal impact on tumor growth, with little effect on angiogenesis, reinforcing the importance of endothelial Vegfr2 heterozygosity. These studies reveal previously unrecognized Vegfr2 gene dosage effects in tumor angiogenesis and a lack of synergy between VEGFR2 and endothelial FGFR1/2 signaling during tumor growth.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Carcinoma, Lewis Lung", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Endothelial Cells", "Gene Dosage", "Humans", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2", "Signal Transduction", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sunday S", "Last Name": "Oladipupo", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA. oladipupo_sunday_s@lilly.com."}, {"First Name": "Ashraf Ul", "Last Name": "Kabir", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyunghee", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Ornitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA. dornitz@wustl.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2018Oct03"}, {"PMID": "30233259", "Title": "Utility of FMS to understand injury incidence in sports: current perspectives.", "Abstract": "The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a popular movement screen used by rehabilitation, as well as strength and conditioning, professionals.

Seven movement patterns comprise the FMS, which was designed to screen fundamental movement requiring a balance between stability and mobility. The 7 movement patterns are summed to a composite FMS score. For an instrument to have wide applicability and acceptability, there must be high levels of reliability, validity, and accuracy. The FMS is certainly a reliable tool, and can be consistently scored within and between raters. Although the FMS has high face and content validity, the criterion validity (discriminant and convergent) is low. Additionally, the FMS does not appear to be studying a single construct, challenging the use of the summed composite FMS score. The accuracy of the FMS in screening for injury is also suspect, with low sensitivity in almost all studies, although specificity is higher. Finally, within the FMS literature, the concepts of prediction and association are conflated, combined with flawed cohort studies, leading to questions about the efficacy of the FMS to screen for injury.

The vast majority of transition-metal-catalyzed cross-couplings rely on a catalytic cycle involving alternating oxidation and reduction of the metal center and are generally limited to forging just one type of new bond per reaction (e.g., the biaryl linkage formed during a Suzuki cross-coupling). This work presents an Isohypsic-Redox Sequence (IRS) that uses one metal to effect two catalytic cycles, thereby generating multiple new types of bonds from a single catalyst source. We show that the IRS strategy is amenable to several widely used transformations including the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, Buchwald-Hartwig amination, and Wacker oxidation. Furthermore, each of these reactions generates value-added heterocycles with significant sp3 -C (3-dimensional) content. Our results provide a general framework for generating complex products by using a single metal to fulfill multiple roles. By uniting different combinations of reactions in the isohypsic and redox phases of the process, this type of catalytic multiple bond-forming platform has the potential for wide applicability in the efficient synthesis of functional organic molecules.", "Keywords": ["heterocycles", "homogeneous catalysis", "isohypsic", "palladium", "tandem catalysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig D", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "WestChem School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "WestChem School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Alina", "Last Name": "Tirla", "Affiliation": "WestChem School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "France", "Affiliation": "WestChem School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK."}], "Journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "PubDate": "2018Nov22"}, {"PMID": "30199856", "Title": "Impact of Dysphagia Assessment and Management on Risk of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Patients with dysphagia are at an increased risk of stroke-associated pneumonia.

The relative roles of genetics and hormones in regulating avian sexual development have been revealed by studies on gynandromorphs. Gynandromorphs are rare bilateral sex chimeras, male on one side of the body and female on the other. We examined a naturally occurring gynandromorphic chicken that was externally male on the right side of the body and female on the left. The bird was diploid but with a mix of ZZ and ZW cells that correlated with the asymmetric sexual phenotype. The male side was 96% ZZ, and the female side was 77% ZZ and 23% ZW. The gonads of this bird at sexual maturity were largely testicular. The right gonad was a testis, with SOX9+ Sertoli cells, DMRT1+ germ cells, and active spermatogenesis. The left gonad was primarily testicular, but with some peripheral aromatase-expressing follicles. The bird had low levels of serum estradiol and high levels of testosterone, as expected for a male. Despite the low percentage of ZW cells on that side, the left side had female sex-linked feathering, smaller muscle mass, smaller leg and spur, and smaller wattle than the male side. This indicates that these sexually dimorphic structures must be at least partly independent of sex steroid effects. Even a small percentage of ZW cells appears sufficient to support female sexual differentiation.

Moving the reference evokes sway responses which exhibit non-linear behavior that has been attributed to sensory reweighting. Reweighting refers to a change in the relative contribution of sensory cues signaling body sway in space and light touch cues signaling finger position with respect to the body. Here we test the hypothesis that the sensory fusion process involves a transformation of light touch signals into the same reference frame as other sensory inputs encoding body sway in space, or vice versa. Eight subjects lightly gripped a robotic manipulandum which moved in a circular arc around the ankle joint. A pseudo-randomized motion sequence with broad spectral characteristics was applied at three amplitudes. The stimulus was presented at two different heights and therefore different radial distances, which were matched in terms of angular motion. However, the higher stimulus evoked a significantly larger sway response, indicating that the response was not matched to stimulus angular motion. Instead, the body sway response was strongly related to the horizontal translation of the manipulandum. The results suggest that light touch is integrated as the horizontal distance between body COM and the finger. The data were well explained by a model with one feedback loop minimizing changes in horizontal COM-finger distance. The model further includes a second feedback loop estimating the horizontal finger motion and correcting the first loop when the touch reference is moving. The second loop includes the predicted transformation of sensory signals into the same reference frame and a non-linear threshold element that reproduces the non-linear sway responses, thus providing a mechanism that can explain reweighting.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Female", "Fingers", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Postural Balance", "Touch Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorenz", "Last Name": "Assl\u00e4nder", "Affiliation": "Sensorimotor Performance Lab, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Craig P", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Raymond F", "Last Name": "Reynolds", "Affiliation": "School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "29860365", "Title": "Is Resolution of Chronic Pain Associated With Changes in Blood Pressure-related Hypoalgesia?", "Abstract": "In healthy individuals, elevated resting blood pressure (BP) is associated with reduced pain responsiveness and lower temporal summation.

Analysis of gynandromorphic chickens and experimental chimeras indicate that sexual phenotype is at least partly cell autonomous in the chicken, with sexually dimorphic gene expression occurring in different tissue and different stages. Gonadal sex differentiation is just one of the many manifestations of sexual phenotype. As in other birds, the chicken has a ZZ male: ZW female sex chromosome system, in which the male is the homogametic sex. Most evidence favours a Z chromosome dosage mechanism underling chicken sex determination, with little evidence of a role for the W chromosome. Indeed, the W appears to harbour a small number of genes that are un-related to sexual development, but have been retained because they are dosage sensitive factors. As global Z dosage compensation is absent in birds, Z-linked genes may direct sexual development in different tissues (males having on average 1.5 to 2 times the expression level of females). In the embryonic gonads, the Z-linked DMRT1 gene plays a key role in testis development. Beyond the gonads, other combinations of Z-linked genes may govern sexual development, together with a role for sex steroid hormones. Gonadal DMRT1 is thought to activate other players in testis development, namely SOX9 and AMH, and the recently identified HEMGN gene. DMRT1 also represses ovarian pathway genes, such as FOXL2 and CYP19A1. A lower level of DMRT1 expression in the female gonads is compatible with activation of the ovarian pathway. Some outstanding questions include how the key testis and ovary genes, DMRT1 and FOXL2, are regulated.

We examined bacterioplankton metacommunities using 16S rRNA amplicons from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific Ocean and in global ocean transect samples to determine sensitivity of these assemblages to environmental perturbations. Habitat filtering was the main assembly mechanism of bacterioplankton community composition in the epi- and mesopelagic waters of the CCZ and the Tara Oceans transect. Bathy- and abyssopelagic bacterioplankton assemblages were mainly assembled by undetermined metacommunity types or neutral and dispersal-driven patch-dynamics for the CCZ and the Malaspina transect. Environmental disturbances may alter the structure of upper-ocean microbial assemblages, with potentially even more substantial, yet unknown, impact on deep-sea communities.

They give rise to mature structures that serve a critical function in the transport and development of the oocyte and/or embryo. In most vertebrates, both sexes initially develop M\u00fcllerian ducts during embryogenesis, but they regress in males under the influence of testis-derived Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH). A number of regulatory factors have been shown to be essential for proper duct development, including Bmp and Wnt signaling molecules, together with homeodomain transcription factors such as PAX2 and LIM1. Later in development, the fate of the ducts diverges between males and females and is regulated by AMH and Wnt signaling molecules (duct regression in males) and Hox genes (duct patterning in females). Most of the genes and molecular pathways known to be involved in M\u00fcllerian duct development have been elucidated through animal models, namely, the mouse and chicken.

There are few data examining pacemaker implantation rates and indications in patients with AF who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). To examine the impact of AF on the incidence of and indications for pacemakers in patients undergoing TAVR, we evaluated data of 1723 patients without pre-existing pacemakers who underwent TAVR in the Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valve (PARTNER) trial. Permanent pacemaker implantation rates and indications were compared in groups based on baseline and discharge heart rhythm: sinus rhythm (SR) vs. AF. 1211 patients manifested SR at baseline/SR at discharge (SR/SR), 105 SR baseline/AF discharge (SR/AF), and 407 AF baseline/AF discharge (AF/AF). Patients who developed and were discharged with AF (SR/AF) had the highest rates of pacemaker implantation at 30 days (13.7% SR/AF vs. 5.4% SR/SR, p=0.0008 and 5.9% AF/AF, p=0.008) and 1 year (17.7% SR/AF vs. 7.1% SR/SR, p=0.0002 and 8.1% AF/AF, p=0.0034). Conversion from SR to AF by discharge was an independent predictor of increased pacemaker implantation at 30 days (HR 2.19 vs. SR/SR, 95% CI 1.23-3.93, p=0.008) and 1 year (HR 1.91 vs. SR/SR, 95% CI 1.33-3.80). Pacemaker indications differed between groups, with relatively more implanted in the AF groups for sick sinus syndrome (SSS) versus AV block. In conclusion, conversion to AF is an independent predictor of permanent pacemaker implantation in TAVR patients.

Future mining of these nodule fields is predicted to have substantial effects on biodiversity and physicochemical conditions in mined areas. Yet, the identity and distributions of bacterial populations in deep-sea sediments and associated polymetallic nodules has received relatively little attention. We examined bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments from samples collected in the water column, sediment, and polymetallic nodules in the Pacific Ocean (bottom depth \u22654,000 m) in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs; defined at 99% 16S rRNA gene identity) affiliated with JTB255 (Gammaproteobacteria) and Rhodospirillaceae (Alphaproteobacteria) had higher relative abundances in the nodule and sediment habitats compared to the water column. Rhodobiaceae family and Vibrio OTUs had higher relative abundance in nodule samples, but were less abundant in sediment and water column samples. Bacterial communities in sediments and associated with nodules were generally similar; however, 5,861 and 6,827 OTUs found in the water column were retrieved from sediment and nodule habitats, respectively. Cyanobacterial OTUs clustering among Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were detected in both sediments and nodules, with greater representation among nodule samples.

The most likely scenario involves a dosage mechanism, whereby the Z-linked DMRT1 gene triggers testis development. However, the possibility still exists that the female-specific W chromosome may harbor an ovarian determining factor. In this study, we provide evidence that the universal gene regulating gonadal sex differentiation in birds is Z-linked DMRT1 and not a W-linked (ovarian) factor. Three candidate W-linked ovarian determinants are HINTW, female-expressed transcript 1 (FET1), and female-associated factor (FAF). To test the association of these genes with ovarian differentiation in the chicken, we examined their expression following experimentally induced female-to-male sex reversal using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole (FAD). Administration of FAD on day 3 of embryogenesis induced a significant loss of aromatase enzyme activity in female gonads and masculinization. However, expression levels of HINTW, FAF, and FET1 were unaltered after experimental masculinization. Furthermore, comparative analysis showed that FAF and FET1 expression could not be detected in zebra finch gonads. Additionally, an antibody raised against the predicted HINTW protein failed to detect it endogenously. These data do not support a universal role for these genes or for the W sex chromosome in ovarian development in birds. We found that DMRT1 (but not the recently identified Z-linked HEMGN gene) is male upregulated in embryonic zebra finch and emu gonads, as in the chicken. As chicken, zebra finch, and emu exemplify the major evolutionary clades of birds, we propose that Z-linked DMRT1, and not the W sex chromosome, regulates gonadal sex differentiation in birds.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Birds", "Chick Embryo", "Chickens", "Embryonic Development", "Female", "Feminization", "Finches", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gonads", "Male", "Sex Chromosomes", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Differentiation", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire E", "Last Name": "Hirst", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Katie L", "Last Name": "Ayers", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rosie J", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mylene", "Last Name": "Mariette", "Affiliation": "Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3216, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Timothy B", "Last Name": "Sackton", "Affiliation": "Informatics Group, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia."}], "Journal": "Endocrinology", "PubDate": "2017Sep01"}, {"PMID": "28874906", "Title": "Megafauna of the UKSRL exploration contract area and eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean: Annelida, Arthropoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, Ctenophora, Mollusca.", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in mining polymetallic nodules from the abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

However, more inaccessible tissues, such as the embryonic urogenital system , have proven more challenging to study.

Either vector can both be used for mis-expressing a gene and for targeting endogenous gene knockdown via expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).

Pteropus alecto (the Black flying-fox) and the paraphyletic P. conspicillatus (the Spectacled flying-fox) appear to be the primary reservoir hosts. Previous studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may underpin infection dynamics in flying-foxes, and subsequent spillover to horses and in turn humans. We sought to examine temporal trends in urinary cortisol concentration in wild Australian flying-fox populations, to elucidate the putative relationship between Hendra virus infection and physiological stress. Pooled and individual urine samples were non-invasively collected from under roosting flying-foxes at two latitudinally disparate regions in the eastern Australian state of Queensland. Hendra virus detection, and (in individual urine samples) sex and species determination were PCR-based. Urinary cortisol measurement used a validated enzyme immunoassay. We found no direct correlation between increased urinary cortisol and Hendra virus excretion, but our findings do suggest a biologically plausible association between low winter temperatures and elevated cortisol levels in P. alecto in the lower latitude Southeast Queensland roosts. We hypothesize an indirect association between low winter temperatures and increased Hendra virus infection and excretion, mediated by the physiological cost of thermoregulation.

However, little is known about factors that influence ANS function in chronic pain. The ANS is the primary pathway for brain-gut communication, making it of particular interest in gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, characterized by functional abdominal pain (FAP). We evaluated the relation of sex, pain severity, and psychological stress to ANS function in adolescents/young adults from a database of pediatric FAP and control participants enrolled 8 years earlier in a prospective study of pain. At follow-up in adolescence/young adulthood (Mean age = 19.46, SD = 3.48), we classified participants as Pain-Remit (n = 130), Pain-Persist (n = 96), and pain-free controls (n = 123). We recorded electrocardiogram data at rest and during laboratory stressors. Results demonstrated significantly lower HRV in Pain-Persist females compared with Pain-Remit females, female controls, and all males regardless of pain category. Spectral analysis of electrocardiogram showed that Pain-Persist females had reduced power in the high frequency domain of cardiac activity, ie, reduced parasympathetic \"braking\" of sympathetic activity, both at rest and during stress. Pain-Remit females exhibited levels of autonomic imbalance intermediate between those of females with persistent FAP and all other participants. Parasympathetically mediated low HRV in young women with persistent FAP may reflect a peripheral mechanism (eg, gut dysfunction) or a central nervous system mechanism (eg, pain amplification or poor emotion self-regulation) involving prolonged sympathetic activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autonomic Nervous System Diseases", "Child", "Chronic Pain", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Sex Characteristics", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lynn S", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda L", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Bruehl", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judy", "Last Name": "Garber", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Puzanovova", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9", "Last Name": "Diedrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Autonomic Dysfunction Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}], "Journal": "Pain", "PubDate": "2017Aug"}, {"PMID": "28658491", "Title": "Health Status Benefits of Transcatheter vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis at Intermediate Surgical Risk: Results From the PARTNER 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.", "Abstract": "In patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at intermediate surgical risk, treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) results in similar 2-year survival.

Part of this rich diversity includes annelid polychaetes but unfortunately, our understanding of such fauna is limited and their genetic variability and evolutionary origins remain poorly known. In this study, we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from three congeneric Decemunciger (Ampharetidae) individuals that had colonized multiple wood falls in the deep (~1600\u2009m) NE Pacific Ocean. Mitochondrial gene order within Decemunciger was similar to the three other available Terebellomorpha genomes, consistent with the relatively conserved nature of mitochondrial genomes within annelids. Unexpectedly, we found introns within the cox1, nad1 and nad4 genes of all three genomes assembled. This is the greatest number of introns observed in annelid mtDNA genomes, and possibly in bilaterians. Interestingly, the introns were of variable sizes suggesting possible evolutionary differences in the age and origins of introns. The sequence of the introns within cox1 is similar to Group II introns previously identified, suggesting that introns in the mitochondrial genome of annelids may be more widespread then realized.

In addition to peripheral responses, salt depletion is detected within the brain via circumventricular organs and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2) neurons to increase salt appetite. Salt appetite is comprised of two main components. One component is the incentive salience or motivation for salt (i.e. how much salt is 'wanted'). Incentive salience is dynamic and largely depends on internal homeostatic conditions in combination with the detection of relevant cues. It involves the mesolimbic system and structures such as the central amygdala, and opioid signalling within these regions can increase salt intake in rodents. A second key feature is the hedonic palatability of salt (i.e. how much it is 'liked') when it is tasted. After detection on the tongue, gustatory information passes through the brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract and thalamus, before being consciously detected within the gustatory cerebral cortex. The positive or negative hedonic value of this stimulus is also dynamic, and is encoded by a network including the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and lateral parabrachial nucleus. Opioid signalling within these areas can alter salt intake, and 'liking'. The overconsumption of dietary salt likely contributes to hypertension and associated diseases, and hence further characterising the role played by opioid signalling has important implications for human health.", "Keywords": ["Incentive salience", "Opioids", "Palatability", "Reward", "Salt appetite"], "MeSH terms": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Animals", "Appetite", "Brain", "Humans", "Motivation", "Neurons", "Sodium Chloride, Dietary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, The School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. andrew.lawrence@florey.edu.au."}], "Journal": "Neurochemical research", "PubDate": "2018Jan"}, {"PMID": "28645814", "Title": "Do apples equal oranges in access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aortic Valve", "Citrus sinensis", "Humans", "Malus", "Medicare", "Patient Readmission", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.

of the embryonic disc consisting of embryonic ectoderm (EmE); (ii) the bottom layer of the disc consisting of mesoderm, endoderm and visceral hypoblast (MEH); (iii) the trophoblast (TB); and (iv) the parietal hypoblast. We performed microsurgery followed by RNA-seq to analyse the transcriptome of these four tissues as well as a developmentally earlier pre-gastrulation embryonic disc. The cattle EmE transcriptome was similar at Stages 4 and 5, characterised by the OCT4/SOX2/NANOG pluripotency network. Expression of genes associated with primordial germ cells suggest their presence in the EmE tissue at these stages. Anterior visceral hypoblast genes were transcribed in the Stage 4 disc, but no longer by Stage 5. The Stage 5 MEH layer was equally similar to mouse embryonic and extraembryonic visceral endoderm. Our data suggest that the first mesoderm to invaginate in cattle embryos is fated to become extraembryonic. TGF\u03b2, FGF, VEGF, PDGFA, IGF2, IHH and WNT signals and receptors were expressed, however the representative members of the FGF families differed from that seen in equivalent tissues of mouse embryos. The TB transcriptome was unique and differed significantly from that of mice. FGF signalling in the TB may be autocrine with both FGFR2 and FGF2 expressed.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF; however, the mechanism through which FGF signaling contributes to pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. We hypothesized that FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling in fibroblasts is required for the fibrotic response to bleomycin. To test this, mice with mesenchyme-specific tamoxifen-inducible inactivation of FGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 (Col1\u03b12-CreER; TCKO mice) were lineage labeled and administered intratracheal bleomycin. Lungs were collected for histologic analysis, whole lung RNA and protein, and dissociated for flow cytometry and FACS. Bleomycin-treated Col1\u03b12-CreER; TCKO mice have decreased pulmonary fibrosis, collagen production, and fewer \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive (\u03b1SMA+) myofibroblasts compared with controls. Freshly isolated Col1\u03b12-CreER; TCKO mesenchymal cells from bleomycin-treated mice have decreased collagen expression compared with wild type mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, lineage labeled FGFR-deficient fibroblasts have decreased enrichment in fibrotic areas and decreased proliferation. These data identify a cell autonomous requirement for mesenchymal FGFR signaling in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and for the enrichment of the Col1\u03b12-CreER-positive (Col1\u03b12+) mesenchymal lineage in fibrotic tissue following bleomycin exposure.

The mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to infection in these patients are unclear. Splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells are innate-like lymphocytes that provide early defence against bacterial infection. Here we show experimental stroke in mice induces a marked loss of MZ B cells, deficiencies in capturing blood-borne antigen and suppression of circulating IgM.

Parents viewed apologies as less important after children's breaches of social convention; parents recognized differences between social domains in their responses to children's transgressions. Irrespective of parenting style, parents were influenced in similar fashion by particular combinations of transgressions and victims, though permissive parents were least likely to anticipate prompting apologies.

The first commercial test mining for polymetallic nodules was carried out in 1970. Since then a number of small-scale commercial test mining or scientific disturbance studies have been carried out. Here we evaluate changes in faunal densities and diversity of benthic communities measured in response to these 11 simulated or test nodule mining disturbances using meta-analysis techniques. We find that impacts are often severe immediately after mining, with major negative changes in density and diversity of most groups occurring. However, in some cases, the mobile fauna and small-sized fauna experienced less negative impacts over the longer term. At seven sites in the Pacific, multiple surveys assessed recovery in fauna over periods of up to 26 years. Almost all studies show some recovery in faunal density and diversity for meiofauna and mobile megafauna, often within one year. However, very few faunal groups return to baseline or control conditions after two decades. The effects of polymetallic nodule mining are likely to be long term. Our analyses show considerable negative biological effects of seafloor nodule mining, even at the small scale of test mining experiments, although there is variation in sensitivity amongst organisms of different sizes and functional groups, which have important implications for ecosystem responses. Unfortunately, many past studies have limitations that reduce their effectiveness in determining responses. We provide recommendations to improve future mining impact test studies.

We searched PubMed up to May-2015 for studies measuring CRP in stroke and evaluating post-stroke infections. Individual participants' data were merged into a single database.

The epibenthic trachymedusa, Ptychogastria polaris Allman, 1878 (Hydrozoa: Trachylina: Ptychogastriidae) occurs in the cold, high latitude systems of both the northern and southern hemispheres, with a circumpolar distribution in Arctic and sub-Arctic areas, and disjunct reports of a few individuals from Antarctica. In January-February 2010, during benthic megafaunal photosurveys in three subpolar fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula (Andvord, Flandres and Barilari Bays), P. polaris was recorded in Antarctic Peninsula waters. The trachymedusa, identified from megacore-collected specimens, was a common component of the epifauna in the sediment floored basins at 436-725 m depths in Andvord and Flandres Bays, reaching densities up to 13 m-2, with mean densities in individual basins ranging from 0.06 to 4.19 m-2. These densities are 2 to 400-fold higher than previously reported for P. polaris in either the Arctic or Antarctic. This trachymedusa had an aggregated distribution, occurring frequently in Andvord Bay, but was often solitary in Flandres Bay, with a distribution not significantly different from random. Epibenthic individuals were similar in size, typically measuring 15-25 mm in bell diameter. A morphologically similar trachymedusa, presumably the same species, was also observed in the water column near the bottom in all three fjords. This benthopelagic form attained abundances of up to 7 m-2 of seafloor; however, most P. polaris (~ 80%), were observed on soft sediments. Our findings indicate that fjords provide a prime habitat for the development of dense populations of P. polaris, potentially resulting from high and varied food inputs to the fjord floors. Because P. polaris resides in the water column and at the seafloor, large P. polaris populations may contribute significantly to pelagic-benthic coupling in the WAP fjord ecosystems.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antarctic Regions", "Bayes Theorem", "Bays", "Body Size", "Ecosystem", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Estuaries", "Geography", "Hydrozoa", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mitochondria", "Oceans and Seas", "Phylogeny"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura J", "Last Name": "Grange", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dhugal J", "Last Name": "Lindsay", "Affiliation": "Japan Agency of Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Natsushima-cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Bastian", "Last Name": "Bentlage", "Affiliation": "Department of Invertebrate Zoology, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Marsh J", "Last Name": "Youngbluth", "Affiliation": "Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Florida Atlantic University, Fort Pierce, Florida, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28031782", "Title": "Limb patterning genes and heterochronic development of the emu wing bud.", "Abstract": "The forelimb of the flightless emu is a vestigial structure, with greatly reduced wing elements and digit loss.

Despite a well-established role for central opioid signaling in sodium appetite, the endogenous influence of specific opioid receptor subtypes within distinct brain regions remains to be elucidated. Using selective pharmacological antagonists of opioid receptor subtypes, we reveal that endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling strongly drives sodium appetite in sodium-depleted mice, whereas a role for kappa (KOR) and delta (DOR) opioid receptor signaling was not detected, at least in sodium-depleted mice. Fos immunohistochemistry revealed discrete regions of the mouse brain displaying an increased number of activated neurons during sodium gratification: the rostral portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract (rNTS), the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), and the central amygdala (CeA). The CeA was subsequently targeted with bilateral infusions of the MOR antagonist naloxonazine, which significantly reduced sodium appetite in mice. The CeA is therefore identified as a key node in the circuit that contributes to sodium appetite.

Soon after the discovery of the relaxin-3 gene, relaxin-3 was identified as an abundant neuropeptide in brain with a distinctive topographical distribution within a small number of GABAergic neuron populations that is well conserved across species. Relaxin-3 is thought to exert its biological actions through a single class-A GPCR - relaxin-family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3). Class-A comprises GPCRs for relaxin-3 and insulin-like peptide-5 and other peptides such as orexin and the monoamine transmitters. The RXFP3 receptor is selectively activated by relaxin-3, whereas insulin-like peptide-5 is the cognate ligand for the related RXFP4 receptor. Anatomical and pharmacological evidence obtained over the last decade supports a function of relaxin-3/RXFP3 systems in modulating responses to stress, anxiety-related and motivated behaviours, circadian rhythms, and learning and memory. Electrophysiological studies have identified the ability of RXFP3 agonists to directly hyperpolarise thalamic neurons in vitro, but there are no reports of direct cell signalling effects in vivo. This article provides an overview of earlier studies and highlights more recent research that implicates relaxin-3/RXFP3 neural network signalling in the integration of arousal, motivation, emotion and related cognition, and that has begun to identify the associated neural substrates and mechanisms.

Males have a ZZ sex chromosome constitution, while females are ZW. Gene(s) on the sex chromosomes must initiate gonadal sex differentiation during embryonic life, inducing paired testes in ZZ individuals and unilateral ovaries in ZW individuals. The traditional view of avian sexual differentiation aligns with that expounded for other vertebrates; upon sexual differentiation, the gonads secrete sex steroid hormones that masculinise or feminise the rest of the body. However, recent studies on naturally occurring or experimentally induced avian sex reversal suggest a significant role for direct genetic factors, in addition to sex hormones, in regulating sexual differentiation of the soma in birds. This review will provide an overview of sex determination in birds and both naturally and experimentally induced sex reversal, with emphasis on the key role of oestrogen. We then consider how recent studies on sex reversal and gynandromorphic birds (half male:half female) are shaping our understanding of sexual differentiation in avians and in vertebrates more broadly. Current evidence shows that sexual differentiation in birds is a mix of direct genetic and hormonal mechanisms. Perturbation of either of these components may lead to sex reversal.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Birds", "Disorders of Sex Development", "Female", "Gonads", "Male", "Ovary", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Differentiation", "Testis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "Major", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology, embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27470484", "Title": "Insights into the abundance and diversity of abyssal megafauna in a polymetallic-nodule region in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone.", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in mining polymetallic nodules in the abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific.

Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle, we surveyed megafauna at four sites within a 900\u2009km(2) stratum in the UK-1 contract area, and at a site ~250\u2009km east of the UK-1 area, allowing us to make the first estimates of abundance and diversity. We distinguished 170 morphotypes within the UK-1 contract area but species-richness estimators suggest this could be as high as 229. Megafaunal abundance averaged 1.48\u2009ind. m(-2). Seven of 12 collected metazoan species were new to science, and four belonged to new genera. Approximately half of the morphotypes occurred only on polymetallic nodules. There were weak, but statistically significant, positive correlations between megafaunal and nodule abundance.

Comparison of female collegiate athletes and college age cohort in tuck jump assessment. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 1048-1054, 2017-The tuck jump assessment (TJA) is a plyometric jumping assessment with 10 flaw criteria against which technique is assessed over a 10-second interval. The TJA has been reported as a tool for identifying neuromuscular deficits that increase risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury, but group specific data on female TJA scores are limited. No cut point has been developed for groups with different activity levels or participation in athletics. This study investigated the association between TJA score and athletic participation in college-aged females. One hundred twenty-one females (53 collegiate athletes and 68 college students) completed the TJA. TJA score was the sum of flaws for the 10 criteria observed, and the number of jumps was recorded. Poisson regression was used to assess the association between TJA score and number of jumps. The association between each of the 10 flaws between groups was assessed with the chi-square test. No significant association was found between groups for TJA score (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.66 \u00b1 1.07 athletes; 5.45 \u00b1 1.05 college cohort; p = 0.06; \u03b2 = 0.82).

The nucleus incertus (NI) is highly responsive to corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and psychological stressors, receives a CRF innervation and expresses CRF1 and CRF2 receptor mRNA. Furthermore, the ascending NI relaxin-3 system is implicated in alcohol seeking in rats. Therefore, in alcohol-preferring rats, we examined the effect of bilateral injections into the NI of the CRF1 receptor antagonist, CP376395 or the CRF2 receptor antagonist, astressin-2B on yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Using quantitative PCR analysis of NI micropunches, we assessed the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on gene expression profiles for components of the relaxin-3 and CRF systems. Bilateral intra-NI injections of CP376395 (500\u2009ng/0.25\u2009\u00b5l) attenuated yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In contrast, intra-NI injections of astressin-2B (200\u2009ng/0.25\u2009\u00b5l) had no significant effect. In line with these data, CRF1 , but not CRF2 , receptor mRNA was upregulated in the NI following chronic ethanol intake. Relaxin family peptide 3 receptor mRNA was also increased in the NI following chronic ethanol. Our quantitative PCR analysis also identified CRF mRNA within the rat NI, and the existence of a newly identified population of CRF-containing neurons was subsequently confirmed by detection of CRF immunoreactivity in rat and mouse NI. These data suggest that NI neurons contribute to reinstatement of alcohol seeking, via an involvement of CRF1 signalling.

We carried out a single-center, prospective observational study to determine if these measures could serve as biomarkers to identify children with sepsis. A secondary aim was to determine if these biomarkers could identify children with neurologic complications of sepsis. A total of 90 patients \u2264 18 years-old were included in this study. 30 with severe sepsis or septic shock were compared to 30 age-matched febrile and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Serial measurements of each biomarker were obtained, beginning on day 1 of ICU admission. In septic patients, MMP9-/TIMP-1 ratios (Median, IQR, n) were reduced on day 1 (0.024, 0.004-0.174, 13), day 2 (0.020, 0.002-0.109, 10), and day 3 (0.018, 0.003-0.058, 23) compared with febrile (0.705, 0.187-1.778, 22) and healthy (0.7, 0.4-1.2, 29) (p< 0.05) controls. A-FaBP and mrProANP (Median, IQR ng/mL, n) were elevated in septic patients compared to control groups on first 2 days after admission to the PICU (p <0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, mrProANP, and A-FaBP to distinguish septic patients from healthy controls were 0.96, 0.99, and 0.76, respectively. MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was inversely and mrProANP was directly related to PIM-2, PELOD, and ICU and hospital LOS (p<0.05). A-FaBP level was associated with PELOD, hospital and ICU length of stay (p<0.05). MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio associated with poor Glasgow Outcome Score (p<0.05). A-FaBP levels in septic patients with neurological dysfunction (29.3, 17.2-54.6, 7) were significantly increased compared to septic patients without neurological dysfunction (14.6, 13.3-20.6, 11). MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios were significantly lower, while A-FaBP and mrProANP were higher in septic patients compared to the control groups. Each biomarker was associated with hospital morbidity and length of stay.

In human lung cancer, fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), a high-affinity ligand for FGFR3, is overexpressed in 10% of primary resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens. Furthermore, in a mouse model where FGF9 can be induced in lung epithelial cells, epithelial proliferation and ensuing tumorigenesis is dependent on FGFR3. To develop new customized therapies for cancers that are dependent on FGFR3 activation, we have used this mouse model to evaluate a human monoclonal antibody (D11) with specificity for the extracellular ligand-binding domain of FGFR3, that recognizes both human and mouse forms of the receptor. Here, we show that D11 effectively inhibits signaling through FGFR3 in vitro, inhibits the growth of FGFR3-dependent FGF9-induced lung adenocarcinoma in mice, and reduces tumor-associated morbidity.

FGF receptors 1 and 2 (Fgfr1 and Fgfr2) are both expressed in the osteoprogenitor lineage. Double conditional knockout mice, in which both receptors were inactivated using an osteoprogenitor-specific Cre driver, appeared normal at birth; however, these mice showed severe postnatal growth defects that include an \u223c50% reduction in body weight and bone mass, and impaired longitudinal bone growth. Histological analysis showed reduced cortical and trabecular bone, suggesting cell-autonomous functions of FGF signaling during postnatal bone formation. Surprisingly, the double conditional knockout mice also showed growth plate defects and an arrest in chondrocyte proliferation. We provide genetic evidence of a non-cell-autonomous feedback pathway regulating Fgf9, Fgf18 and Pthlh expression, which led to increased expression and signaling of Fgfr3 in growth plate chondrocytes and suppression of chondrocyte proliferation. These observations show that FGF signaling in the osteoprogenitor lineage is obligately coupled to chondrocyte proliferation and the regulation of longitudinal bone growth.", "Keywords": ["Chondrocyte", "Endochondral bone formation", "FGF signaling", "IHH", "Mouse", "Osteoblast", "PTHLH", "Skeletal development"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Bone Development", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Chondrocytes", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Growth Plate", "Integrases", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Biological", "Osteocytes", "Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2", "Signal Transduction", "Sp7 Transcription Factor", "Stem Cells", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kannan", "Last Name": "Karuppaiah", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA Division of Craniofacial Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington and Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joohyun", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianquan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fanxin", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Ornitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA dornitz@wustl.edu."}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2016May15"}, {"PMID": "27040324", "Title": "Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement in Intermediate-Risk Patients.", "Abstract": "Previous trials have shown that among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis, survival rates are similar with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic-valve replacement.

From the randomized controlled Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve trials A and B and the continued access registries, a total of 1,416 patients received transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement, of which 857 underwent surgical, and 559 underwent percutaneous access. Thirty-day rates of major vascular complications and quality of life scores were assessed. Propensity matching was used to adjust for unmeasured confounders. Overall, there were 116 major vascular complications (8.2%). Complication rates decreased dramatically during the study period. In unadjusted analysis, major vascular complications were significantly less common in the percutaneous access group (35 [6.3%] vs 81 [9.5%] p\u00a0= 0.032). However, among 292 propensity-matched pairs, there was no difference in major vascular complications (22 [7.5%] vs 28 [9.6%], p\u00a0= 0.37). Percutaneous access was associated with fewer total in-hospital vascular complications (46 [16%] vs 66 [23%], p\u00a0= 0.036), shorter median procedural duration (97 interquartile range [IQR 68 to 166] vs 121 [IQR 78 to 194] minutes, p <0.0001), and median length of stay (4 [IQR 2 to 8] vs 6 [IQR 3 to 10] days, p <0.0001). There were no significant differences in quality of life scores at 30\u00a0days. Surgical access for large-bore femoral access does not appear to confer any advantages over percutaneous access and may be associated with more minor vascular complications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aortic Valve", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Cardiac Catheterization", "Femoral Artery", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Humans", "Incidence", "Postoperative Complications", "Quality of Life", "Registries", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "Treatment Outcome", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "McCabe", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

By contrast, less is known about the development of retributive justice. In a study with 4- to 10-year-old children (n = 123) and adults (n = 93), we directly compared the development of reasoning about distributive and retributive justice. We measured the amount of rewards or punishments that participants allocated to recipients who differed in the amount of good or bad things they had done. We also measured judgments about collective rewards and punishments. We found that the developmental trajectory of thinking about retributive justice parallels that of distributive justice. The 4- to 5-year-olds were the most likely to prefer equal distributions of both rewarding and aversive consequences; older children and adults preferred deservingness-based allocations. The 4- to 5-year-olds were also most likely to judge collective rewards and punishments as fair; this tendency declined with increasing age. Our results also highlight the extent to which the notion of desert influences thinking about distributive and retributive justice; desert was considered equally when participants allocated reward and punishments, but in judgments about collective discipline, participants focused more on desert in cases of punishment compared with reward.

This highly conserved function is retained in birds and is supported by the high levels of AMH expression in developing testes. Mammalian AMH expression is regulated by a combination of transcription factors, the most important being Sry-type high-mobility-group box transcription factor-9 (SOX9). In the chicken embryo, however, AMH mRNA expression precedes that of SOX9, leading to the view that AMH may play a more central role in avian testicular development. To define its role in chicken gonadal development, AMH was overexpressed using the RCASBP viral vector. AMH caused the gonads of both sexes to develop as small and undeveloped structures at both embryonic and adult stages. Molecular analysis revealed that although female gonads developed testis-like cords, gonads lacked Sertoli cells and were incapable of steroidogenesis. A similar gonadal phenotype was also observed in males, with a complete loss of both Sertoli cells, disrupted SOX9 expression and gonadal steroidogenesis. At sexual maturity both sexes showed a female external phenotype but retained sexually dimorphic body weights that matched their genetic sexes. These data suggest that AMH does not operate as an early testis activator in the chicken but can affect downstream events, such as sex steroid hormone production. In addition, this study provides a unique opportunity to assess chicken sexual development in an environment of sex hormone deficiency, demonstrating the importance of both hormonal signaling and direct cell autonomous factors for somatic sex identity in birds.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Mullerian Hormone", "Body Size", "Body Weight", "Chick Embryo", "Chickens", "Estradiol", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Genitalia", "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "Gonads", "In Situ Hybridization", "Male", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "SOX9 Transcription Factor", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Differentiation", "Sexual Development", "Testosterone"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luke S", "Last Name": "Lambeth", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (L.S.L., K.L.A., A.H.S., A.D.C.), Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia;

FGF receptors (FGFRs) are expressed in multiple cell types in the adult heart, but the cell type-specific FGFR signaling that mediates different cardioprotective endpoints is not known. To determine the requirement for FGFR signaling in endothelium in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, we conditionally inactivated the Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 genes in endothelial cells with Tie2-Cre (Tie2-Cre, Fgfr1(f/f), Fgfr2(f/f) DCKO mice). Tie2-Cre, Fgfr1(f/f), Fgfr2(f/f) DCKO mice had normal baseline cardiac morphometry, function, and vessel density. When subjected to closed-chest, regional cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, Tie2-Cre, Fgfr1(f/f), Fgfr2(f/f) DCKO mice showed a significantly increased hypokinetic area at 7 days, but not 1 day, after reperfusion. Tie2-Cre, Fgfr1(f/f), Fgfr2(f/f) DCKO mice also showed significantly worsened cardiac function compared with controls at 7 days but not 1 day after reperfusion. Pathophysiological analysis showed significantly decreased vessel density, increased endothelial cell apoptosis, and worsened tissue hypoxia in the peri-infarct area at 7 days following reperfusion. Notably, Tie2-Cre, Fgfr1(f/f), Fgfr2(f/f) DCKO mice showed no impairment in the cardiac hypertrophic response. These data demonstrate an essential role for FGFR1 and FGFR2 in endothelial cells for cardiac functional recovery and vascular remodeling following in vivo cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, without affecting the cardiac hypertrophic response. This study suggests the potential for therapeutic benefit from activation of endothelial FGFR pathways following ischemic injury to the heart.", "Keywords": ["cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury", "endothelium", "fibroblast growth factor", "myocardial infarction", "vascular remodeling"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Capillaries", "Cardiomegaly", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endothelial Cells", "Female", "Male", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocardium", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2", "Recovery of Function", "Signal Transduction", "Stroke Volume", "Time Factors", "Vascular Remodeling", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stacey L", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "Division of Emergency Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri staceyhouse@wustl.edu."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Castro", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Traian S", "Last Name": "Lupu", "Affiliation": "Division of Emergency Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Carla", "Last Name": "Weinheimer", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Research, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; and."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Attila", "Last Name": "Kovacs", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Research, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; and."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Ornitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.
