This study investigated what environmental exposures may have driven this increase. We obtained EOCRC incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, and data for 11 exposures, for example, body mass index (BMI), from long-term national surveys. We aggregated these data for 30 to 49-year-olds during 1992 to 2016 by population subgroups defined by calendar period, age, race and sex, and used negative binomial regression models to identify and estimate associations of EOCRC with multiple exposures. Furthermore, we used counterfactual modeling to quantify contributions of identified risk factors to EOCRC incidence. The top models (with lowest Bayesian Information Criteria) consistently identified excess body weight, represented by overweight and obesity (BMI \u226525) or obesity alone (BMI \u226530), as the strongest risk factor. The best-performing model estimated increased EOCRC incidence due to overweight and obesity, with an incidence rate ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.20 (1.17-1.22) for white men, 1.04 (1.00-1.08) for black men, 1.17 (1.15-1.21) for white women and 1.03 (0.97-1.08) for black women. Increases in overweight and obesity prevalence contributed to an estimated 30% (standard error: 1%) for men and 28% (standard error: 2%) for women of ECORC incidence during 1992 to 2016. These findings suggest excess body weight substantially contributed to and is likely a primary driver of the rising incidence of EOCRC in the United States.

Although numerous studies have evaluated the effectiveness of screening interventions for identifying cancer at earlier stages, there is no quantitative analysis that studies the optimal early detection time interval that results in the greatest mortality benefit; such data could serve as a target and benchmark for cancer early detection strategies. In this study, we focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer known for its lack of early symptoms. Consequently, it is most often detected at late stages when the 5-year survival rate is only 3%. We developed a PDAC population model that simulates an individual patient's age and stage at diagnosis, while replicating overall US cancer incidence and mortality rates. The model includes \"cancer sojourn time,\" serving as a proxy for the speed of cancer progression, with shorter times indicating rapid progression and longer times indicating slower progression. In our PDAC model, our hypothesis was that earlier cancer detection, potentially through a hypothetical screening intervention in the counterfactual analysis, would yield reduced mortality as compared to a no-screening group. We found that the benefits of early detection, such as increased life-years gained, are greater when the sojourn time is shorter, reaching their maximum when identification is made 4-6\u00a0years prior to clinical diagnosis (e.g., when a symptomatic diagnosis is made). However, when early detection occurs even earlier, for example 6-10\u00a0years prior to clinical diagnosis, the benefits significantly diminish for shorter sojourn time cancers, and level off for longer sojourn time cancers. Our study clarifies the potential benefits of PDAC early detection that explicitly incorporates individual patient heterogeneity in cancer progression and identifies quantitative benchmarks for future interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Mass Screening"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiheum", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jp4147@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Prest", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer S", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zainab", "Last Name": "Aziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Agyekum", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophie", "Last Name": "Wagner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roman", "Last Name": "Gulati", "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ch447@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2023Nov16"}, {"PMID": "37971743", "Title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Liquid Biopsy for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Patients Who Are Unscreened.", "Abstract": "Despite recommendations for universal screening, adherence to colorectal cancer screening in the US is approximately 60%.

In this study, we develop a deep learning framework for incorporating longitudinal clinical data from EHR to infer risk for pancreatic cancer (PC). This framework includes a novel training protocol, which enforces an emphasis on early detection by applying an independent Poisson-random mask on proximal-time measurements for each variable. Data fusion for irregular multivariate time-series features is enabled by a \"grouped\" neural network (GrpNN) architecture, which uses representation learning to generate a dimensionally reduced vector for each measurement set before making a final prediction. These models were evaluated using EHR data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital. Our framework demonstrated better performance on early detection (AUROC 0.671, CI 95% 0.667 - 0.675, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at 12\u00a0months prior to diagnosis compared to a logistic regression, xgboost, and a feedforward neural network baseline. We demonstrate that our masking strategy results greater improvements at distal times prior to diagnosis, and that our GrpNN model improves generalizability by reducing overfitting relative to the feedforward baseline. The results were consistent across reported race. Our proposed algorithm is potentially generalizable to other diseases including but not limited to cancer where early detection can improve survival.", "Keywords": ["Early detection of cancer", "Electronic Health Records", "Machine learning", "Pancreatic cancer"], "MeSH terms": ["Deep Learning", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiheum", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Artin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kate E", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yoanna S", "Last Name": "Pumpalova", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Myles A", "Last Name": "Ingram", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin L", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Applied Info Partners Inc, Worlds Fair Drive, Somerset, NJ, United States; X-Mechanics LLC, Cresskill, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.

Yet many AF screening strategies exist, including the use of wrist-worn wearable devices, and their comparative effectiveness is not well-understood. Methods and Results We developed a decision-analytic model simulating 50\u00a0million individuals with an age, sex, and comorbidity profile matching the United States population aged \u226565\u00a0years (ie, with a guideline-based AF screening indication). We modeled no screening, in addition to 45 distinct AF screening strategies (comprising different modalities and screening intervals), each initiated at a clinical encounter. The primary effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life-years, with incident stroke and major bleeding as secondary measures. We defined continuous or nearly continuous modalities as those capable of monitoring beyond a single time-point (eg, patch monitor), and discrete modalities as those capable of only instantaneous AF detection (eg, 12-lead ECG). In total, 10 AF screening strategies were effective compared with no screening (300-1500 quality-adjusted life-years gained/100\u00a0000 individuals screened). Nine (90%) effective strategies involved use of a continuous or nearly continuous modality such as patch monitor or wrist-worn wearable device, whereas 1 (10%) relied on discrete modalities alone. Effective strategies reduced stroke incidence (number needed to screen to prevent a stroke: 3087-4445) but increased major bleeding (number needed to screen to cause a major bleed: 1815-4049) and intracranial hemorrhage (number needed to screen to cause intracranial hemorrhage: 7693-16 950). The test specificity was a highly influential model parameter on screening effectiveness. Conclusions When modeled from a clinician-directed perspective, the comparative effectiveness of population-based AF screening varies substantially upon the specific strategy used. Future screening interventions and guidelines should consider the relative effectiveness of specific AF screening strategies.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "cost\u2010effectiveness", "microsimulation", "screening"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Intracranial Hemorrhages", "Mass Screening", "Stroke", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaan", "Last Name": "Khurshid", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center and Cardiac Arrhythmia Service Division of Cardiology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA."}, {"First Name": "Wanyi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Technology Assessment Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Singer", "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital MA."}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Atlas", "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital MA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Ashburner", "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital MA."}, {"First Name": "Jin G", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine Chicago IL."}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine Columbia University New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Patrick T", "Last Name": "Ellinor", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center and Cardiac Arrhythmia Service Division of Cardiology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "McManus", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine University of Massachusetts Medical School Worcester MA."}, {"First Name": "Jagpreet", "Last Name": "Chhatwal", "Affiliation": "Institute for Technology Assessment Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Lubitz", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Center and Cardiac Arrhythmia Service Division of Cardiology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2021Sep21"}, {"PMID": "34470116", "Title": "Delivery risks and outcomes associated with grand multiparity.", "Abstract": "There is limited recent US national data on risk for adverse outcomes associated with grand multiparity.", "Keywords": ["Grand multiparity", "grand multipara", "maternal outcomes", "pregnancy", "severe maternal morbidity"], "MeSH terms": ["Infant, Newborn", "Pregnancy", "Female", "United States", "Humans", "Parity", "Premature Birth", "Postpartum Hemorrhage", "Abruptio Placentae", "Eclampsia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation", "Pulmonary Edema", "Retrospective Studies", "Placenta", "Shock", "Heart Failure", "Acute Kidney Injury"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kate E", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Maternal-Fetal Medicine Fellowship Program, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam S", "Last Name": "Faye", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Henry D.

The aim of this study was to examine the sustained impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures on the diet and exercise habits, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life among adults in the U.S. We conducted a longitudinal study using a convenience sample of participants recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform between March 30 and April 7, 2020, and 8 months into the outbreak, from November 2 to November 21, 2020. We compared self-reported diet and exercise habits and risk for food insecurity shortly after the pandemic began, in April, to those reported in November. We also measured changes in quality-of-life using the PROMIS-29\u00a0+\u00a02 (PROPr) scale. A total of 636 respondents completed both surveys. Compared to reports in April, respondents ate lunch and dinner out more frequently in November and consumed more take-out and fast food. Weekly frequencies of consuming frozen food and the number of daily meals were slightly lower in November than they were in April. 54% of respondents screened positively for being at risk for food insecurity in April, reducing to 41% by November. In April, survey respondents were found to have lower quality-of-life relative to U.S. population norms, but by November levels of depression and cognitive function had improved.

To reduce radiation dose to critical GI structures including the rectum and oral mucosa, 3D-printed GI radioprotective devices composed of high-Z materials are generated from patient CT scans. In a radiation proctitis rat model, a significant reduction in crypt injury is demonstrated with the device compared to without (p <\u00a00.0087). Optimal device placement for radiation attenuation is further confirmed in a swine model. Dosimetric modeling in oral cavity cancer patients demonstrates a 30% radiation dose reduction to the normal buccal mucosa and a 15.2% dose reduction in the rectum for prostate cancer patients with the radioprotectant material in place compared to without. Finally, it is found that the rectal radioprotectant device is more cost-effective compared to a hydrogel rectal spacer.

However, little research approaches men as gendered subjects, despite their dramatically increased risk of opioid overdose. Accordingly, we examined gender differences in prescription opioid use and misuse with specific attention to implications for men using data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We used design-adjusted, weighted Wald tests and multivariate logistic regression to compare gender differences in rates of prescription opioid use and misuse, prescription opioid sources, primary motivation for misuse, and prescription opioid dependence. We found that although men were significantly less likely than women to report opioid use, they were significantly more likely to report opioid misuse and to misuse prescription opioids primarily to feel good or get high. Among past-year opioid users, men were significantly more likely than women to meet DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. Results are consistent with past work on the intersection of masculinity norms and health behaviors. Although gender-specific interventions are typically synonymous with interventions tailored to women, our results suggest that such interventions could alleviate the burden of the opioid epidemic for men as well. Further research studying possible mechanisms that explain men's increased vulnerability to the opioid epidemic is urgently needed to address this growing public health crisis.", "Keywords": ["Gender", "Opioid abuse", "Opioid crisis", "Psychosocial factors", "Public health", "Substance abuse", "Substance dependence"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Masculinity", "Men's Health", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Opioid Epidemic", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Prescription Drug Misuse", "Public Health", "Sex Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elisabeth R", "Last Name": "Silver", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of General Medicine, New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of General Medicine, New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

This variability complicates clinical decision-making despite the improvement of survival due to the recent introduction of FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and nab-paclitaxel. Questions remain as to the timing and sequence of therapies and the role of radiotherapy for unresectable PDAC. Here we developed a computational analysis platform to investigate the dynamics of growth, metastasis and treatment response to FFX, gemcitabine (GEM), and GEM+nab-paclitaxel. Our approach was informed using data of 1,089 patients treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and validated using an independent cohort from Osaka Medical College. Our framework establishes a logistic growth pattern of PDAC and defines the Local Advancement Index (LAI), which determines the eventual primary tumor size and predicts the number of metastases. We found that a smaller LAI leads to a larger metastatic burden. Furthermore, our analyses ascertain that i) radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy improves survival in cases receiving induction FFX or with larger LAI, ii) neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in cases with resectable PDAC, and iii) temporary cessations of chemotherapies do not impact overall survival, which supports the feasibility of treatment holidays for patients with FFX-associated adverse effects.

In addition, as it is well known that HIV positivity increases cervical cancer risk, it is important to quantify the prevalence of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma among Cambodian women living with HIV disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 499 HIV+ and 501 HIV- Cambodian women at the Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE. Visual inspection with 5% acetic acid was the method of screening. Colposcopy was performed on all VIA+ patients, and subsequent treatment followed WHO guidelines. Logistic regression models, stratified by both HIV+ and HIV- groups, were used to assess significant factors associated with having dysplasia. Results: VIA+ results were prevalent in both the HIV+ and HIV- arms of the study. The HIV+ patients were more likely to have a lower age at coitarche, lower weight, 2 or more lifetime sexual partners, two or greater pregnancies, or be unmarried. The estimated prevalence of VIA detected cervical dysplasia was 11% for the entire study sample, 13.4% in the HIV positive (HIV+) group and 8.6% in the HIV negative (HIV-) group (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.48; p=0.01). For the HIV+ group, having a history of 4 or more full-term pregnancies (OR: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.01-11.64; p=0.049) was found to be significantly associated with having an increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia in the multivariate model. Conclusion: Cervical dysplasia is prevalent in both HIV positive and negative Cambodian women and a VIA based national screening programs need to be developed and expanded to provide access to affordable and effective treatment for cervical dysplasia and cancers.", "Keywords": ["Cervical cancer", "cervical lesions", "HIV", "visual inspection with Acetic Acid", "Cambodia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cambodia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Precancerous Conditions", "Prevalence", "Prognosis", "Uterine Cervical Dysplasia", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sovannara", "Last Name": "Thay", "Affiliation": "Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE, Cambodia.

We built a mathematical model to give a real-time, location-based optimal emergency medical service routing location based on local resources, transport times, and patient characteristics. Methods- Using location, onset time, age, sex, and prehospital stroke severity, we calculated odds of a favorable outcome for a patient with suspected large vessel occlusions under 2 scenarios: direct to EVT-capable hospital versus transport to the nearest alteplase-capable hospital with transfer to EVT-capable hospital if appropriate. We project lifetime outcomes incorporating disability, quality of life utility, and cost. Multiple parameter sets of center-specific times (eg, door to alteplase) were randomly selected within a clinically plausible range to account for the model sensitivity to these estimates; for each iteration, the optimal strategy was defined as the most cost-effective outcome (threshold, $100\u2009000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained). After 1000 simulations, the most frequently occurring optimal strategy was the final recommendation, with its strength measured as the proportion of runs for which it was optimal. Results- Routing recommendations were highly sensitive to small changes in model input parameters. Under many scenarios, the recommendations for direct transfer to the EVT site increased with increasing stroke severity and geographic proximity but did not vary substantially with respect to sex, age, or onset time. Conclusions- We present a mathematical decision model that determines ideal prehospital routing recommendations for patients with suspected stroke because of large vessel occlusions, with consideration of patient characteristics and location at onset. This model may be further refined by incorporating real-time data on traffic patterns and actual EVT and alteplase timeliness performance.

In this study, a microsimulation model was developed to analyze the trade-offs between initiating HCV therapy in the acute versus chronic phase of infection. By simulating the lifetime clinical course of patients with acute HCV infection, we were able to project long-term outcomes such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. We found that treating acute HCV versus deferring treatment until the chronic phase increased QALYs by 0.02 and increased costs by $483 in patients not at risk of transmitting HCV. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $19,991 per QALY, demonstrating that treatment of acute HCV was cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.

We estimated that in 2010, 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.1) million noninstitutionalized people were viremic, which dropped to 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.6) million in 2015, and projected to drop below 1 million by 2020. A total of 1.8 million HCV patients will receive HCV treatment from the launch of oral DAAs in 2014 until 2030. Based on current HCV management practices, it will take 4-6 years to treat the majority of patients aware of their disease. However, 560,000 patients would still remain unaware by 2020. Even in the oral DAA era, 320,000 patients will die, 157,000 will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and 203,000 will develop decompensated cirrhosis in the next 35 years.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Antiviral Agents", "Cost of Illness", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Prevalence", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jagpreet", "Last Name": "Chhatwal", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Technology Assessment, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojie", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "H.

However, aspirin is associated with potential complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, and statins are associated with myopathy. We developed a simulation disease model to study the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of aspirin and statin chemoprevention against esophageal adenocarcinoma. A decision analytic Markov model was constructed to compare four strategies for Barrett's esophagus management; all regimens included standard endoscopic surveillance regimens: (i) endoscopic surveillance alone, (ii) aspirin therapy, (iii) statin therapy, and (iv) combination therapy of aspirin and statin. Endpoints evaluated were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of model input uncertainty on results. Assuming an annual progression rate of 0.33% per year from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, aspirin therapy was more effective and cost less than (dominated) endoscopic surveillance alone. When combination therapy was compared with aspirin therapy, the ICER was $158,000/QALY, which was above our willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Statin therapy was dominated by combination therapy. When higher annual cancer progression rates were assumed in the model (0.5% per year), combination therapy was cost-effective compared with aspirin therapy, producing an ICER of $96,000/QALY. In conclusion, aspirin chemoprevention was both more effective and cost less than endoscopic surveillance alone. Combination therapy using both aspirin and statin is expensive but could be cost-effective in patients at higher risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aspirin", "Barrett Esophagus", "Case-Control Studies", "Chemoprevention", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Middle Aged", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sung Eun", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital, 101 Merrimac Street, 10th Floor, Boston, MA 02114. chur@partners.org."}, {"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Perzan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angela C", "Last Name": "Tramontano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chung Yin", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chin", "Last Name": "Hur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24041354", "Title": "Responsiveness of the testing morbidities index in colonoscopy.", "Abstract": "The Testing Morbidities Index (TMI) was developed to measure the effects of any diagnostic or screening procedure on health-related quality of life (HRQOL); it includes seven domains incorporating mental and physical aspects before, during, and after testing.
