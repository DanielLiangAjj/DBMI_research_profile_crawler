Quantifying normal biomechanical function and detecting potentially detrimental biomechanical dysfunction (e.g., cervical insufficiency, uterine overdistention, premature rupture of membranes) is difficult, largely due to minimal data on the shape and size of maternal anatomy and material properties of tissue across gestation. This study quantitates key structural features of human pregnancy to fill this knowledge gap and facilitate three-dimensional modeling for biomechanical pregnancy simulations to deeply explore pregnancy and childbirth. These measurements include the longitudinal assessment of uterine and cervical dimensions, fetal weight, and cervical stiffness in 47 low-risk pregnancies at four time points during gestation (late first, middle second, late second, and middle third trimesters). The uterine and cervical size were measured via 2-dimensional ultrasound, and cervical stiffness was measured via cervical aspiration. Trends in uterine and cervical measurements were assessed as time-course slopes across pregnancy and between gestational time points, accounting for specific participants. Patient-specific computational solid models of the uterus and cervix, generated from the ultrasonic measurements, were used to estimate deformed uterocervical volume. Results show that for this low-risk cohort, the uterus grows fastest in the inferior-superior direction from the late first to middle second trimester and fastest in the anterior-posterior and left-right direction between the middle and late second trimester. Contemporaneously, the cervix softens and shortens. It softens fastest from the late first to the middle second trimester and shortens fastest between the late second and middle third trimester. Alongside the fetal weight estimated from ultrasonic measurements, this work presents holistic maternal and fetal patient-specific biomechanical measurements across gestation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erin M", "Last Name": "Louwagie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serena R", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline C", "Last Name": "Hairston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Nottman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chia-Ling", "Last Name": "Nhan-Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karin", "Last Name": "Fuchs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Gyamfi-Bannerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Whitney", "Last Name": "Booker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Andrikopoulou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Noelia", "Last Name": "Zork", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mirella", "Last Name": "Mourad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Helen M", "Last Name": "Feltovich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May03"}, {"PMID": "38714721", "Title": "Genetic polymorphisms associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas.", "Abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) affect a large proportion of pregnancies and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

We clustered participants by their genetic ancestry and focused our analyses on three sub-cohorts with the largest sample sizes: European, African, and Admixed American.

We conducted a secondary analysis of data of the nuMoM2b Study (2010-2013) to examine the associations between individual and structural-level experiences of racism and discrimination and gestational age at birth among nulliparous women (n=7,732) at eight sites across the U.S. Measures included the individual Experiences of Discrimination (EOD) scale and the Index of Concentration (ICE) at the Extremes to measure structural racism. After adjustment,we observed a significant individual and structural racism interaction on gestational length (p=0.03). In subgroup analyses, we found that among these with high EOD scores, women who were from households concentrated in the more privileged group had significantly longer gestations (\u03b2 = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.90). Women who reported higher EOD scores and more economic privilege had longer gestations, demonstrating the moderating effect of ICE as a measure of structural racism.

The phenotype spectrum associated with this copy number change is variable, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and dysmorphology. This study describes a patient with developmental delays and brain abnormalities. G-banded karyotype, FISH, SNP oligonucleotide microarray analysis (SOMA), and whole exome sequencing analysis were performed. Postnatal reanalysis of prenatal SOMA and follow-up parental testing revealed a paternally inherited 63 kb deletion at 1q42.11 in the patient. We characterized the clinical features of this patient, providing insight into the clinical phenotype associated with deletions of the 1q42.11 sub-band. Our study provides new evidence supporting the potential functional importance of the FBXO28 3' UTR region and the hypothesis that FBXO28 is a critical gene in the pathogenesis of chromosome 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome.

We undertook a scoping review to illustrate the breadth of risk factors for preterm birth that have been reported in the literature. We conducted a search in the PubMed database for articles published in the previous 5 years. We determined eligibility for this scoping review by screening titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review. We extracted odds ratios and other measures of association for each identified risk factor in the articles. A total of 2,509 unique articles were identified from the search, of which 314 were eligible for inclusion in our final analyses. We summarized risk factors and their relative impacts in the following categories: Activity, Psychological, Medical History, Toxicology, Genetics, and Vaginal Microbiome. Many risk factors for preterm birth have been reported. It is challenging to synthesize findings given the multitude of isolated risk factors that have been studied, inconsistent definitions of risk factors and outcomes, and use of different covariates in analyses. Novel methods of analyzing large datasets may promote a more comprehensive understanding of the etiology of preterm birth and ability to predict the outcome.

However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated its performance against current standard-of-care diagnostic tests: karyotype, chromosomal microarray (CMA), and exome sequencing (ES). To assess the clinical utility of GS, we compared its diagnostic yield against these three tests in 1,612 quartet families including an individual with ASD and in 295 prenatal families. Our GS analytic framework identified a diagnostic variant in 7.8% of ASD probands, almost 2-fold more than CMA (4.3%) and 3-fold more than ES (2.7%). However, when we systematically captured copy-number variants (CNVs) from the exome data, the diagnostic yield of ES (7.4%) was brought much closer to, but did not surpass, GS. Similarly, we estimated that GS could achieve an overall diagnostic yield of 46.1% in unselected FSAs, representing a 17.2% increased yield over karyotype, 14.1% over CMA, and 4.1% over ES with CNV calling or 36.1% increase without CNV discovery. Overall, GS provided an added diagnostic yield of 0.4% and 0.8% beyond the combination of all three standard-of-care tests in ASD and FSAs, respectively. This corresponded to nine GS unique diagnostic variants, including sequence variants in exons not captured by ES, structural variants (SVs) inaccessible to existing standard-of-care tests, and SVs where the resolution of GS changed variant classification. Overall, this large-scale evaluation demonstrated that GS significantly outperforms each individual standard-of-care test while also outperforming the combination of all three tests, thus warranting consideration as the first-tier diagnostic approach for the assessment of ASD and FSAs.", "Keywords": ["genome sequencing, karyotype, microarray, exome sequencing, structural variant, autism spectrum disorder, structural anomaly, prenatal, first-tier, diagnostic"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Pregnancy", "Humans", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Pregnancy Trimester, First", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal", "Chromosome Mapping", "Exome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chelsea", "Last Name": "Lowther", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA;

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and polycystic ovary syndrome are associated with both hyperandrogenism and increased risk for ASD. We examined whether increased maternal testosterone mediates the relationship between these hyperandrogenic disorders (HDs) during pregnancy and child communication and social skills. Maternal plasma was collected during the second trimester and parent-report measures of child communication and social skills were obtained at 4.5-6.5 years of age from 270 participants enrolled in the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b). Our retrospective frequency-matched cohort study design identified 58 mothers with one or both of the HDs and 58 matched controls. Women diagnosed with an HD who carried a female had higher testosterone levels compared to those carrying a male (t(56) = -2.70, p = 0.01). Compared to females controls, females born to women with an HD had significantly higher scores on the Social Communication Questionnaire (t(114) = -2.82, p =0.01). Maternal testosterone partially mediated the relationship between a diagnosis of an HD and SCQ scores among females. These findings point to sex-specific associations of two HDs - hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and polycystic ovary syndrome - on child communication and social skills and a mediating effect of maternal testosterone during pregnancy.

"Stillbirths account for half of all perinatal mortality, but the underlying cause of a significant portion of the cases remains unknown. We set out to test the potential role and extent of microbial infection in stillbirth through a case-control analysis of fetal cord blood collected from the multisite Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network. Cases (n\u2009=\u200960) were defined as stillbirths at >20\u2009weeks of gestation, and controls (n\u2009=\u2009176) were live births. The bacterial presence, abundance, and composition were analyzed by endpoint PCR of full-length 16S rRNA and the V4 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The results demonstrate that bacterial prevalence and abundance were both significantly increased in stillbirth, even after adjusting for maternal age, race, body mass index, number of pregnancies, gestational age, and multiple gestations. Composition of bacterial communities in the cord blood also differed significantly. Using a group of 25 ASVs differentially abundant between the two groups, a Random Forest classification model achieved an accuracy score of 0.76 differentiating stillbirth and live birth, with Group B Streptococcus as the most enriched species in stillbirth. Positive PCR was also significantly associated with early preterm birth. A group of oral anaerobes, including Actinomyces, Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, were enriched in live early preterm birth, suggesting possible oral origin of infection. Our ASV-based microbiome analysis revealed specific candidate pathogens associated with infections in stillbirth and early preterm birth. The cord blood microbial signatures may be markers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our study will help identify possible mechanism of infection and improve our ability to prevent stillbirth and early preterm birth. IMPORTANCE Stillbirth accounts for half of all perinatal mortality, but the underlying cause of a substantial portion of all cases remains elusive. We examined the umbilical cord blood microbiome in stillbirths (n\u2009=\u200960) and live births (n\u2009=\u2009176) and discovered that the bacterial prevalence and abundance were significantly higher in stillbirths than live births. The microbial compositions also differed significantly. Group B Streptococcus was the most prevalent species detected in stillbirth. In addition, pathogens previously unknown to be associated with stillbirth were identified. A group of oral anaerobes including Fusobacterium nucleatum were found to be specifically enriched in the cord blood in early preterm live birth. This is by far the most comprehensive study to examine the microbial signatures in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood microbial signatures may be markers for adverse birth outcomes.

A wide range of mosaicism has been reported, which may, to some extent, account for the variable spectrum of observed phenotypes. We report here a pregnancy conceived using intrauterine insemination in a 32-year-old female with a history of infertility. Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) was performed in the first trimester which reported an increased risk for trisomy 13. Follow-up cytogenetic workup using chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniotic fluid samples showed a mosaic karyotype with a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) identified a mosaic 31.34\u00a0Mb terminal gain on chr13q31.1q34 showing the likely origin of the sSMC to distal chromosome 13q. Follow-up metaphase FISH testing suggested an inverted duplication rearrangement involving 13q31q34 in the marker chromosome and the presence of a neocentromere. At 21\u00a0months of age, the proband has a history of gross motor delay, hypotonia, left microphthalmia, strabismus, congenital anomaly of the right optic nerve, hemangiomas, and a tethered spinal cord. Postnatal chromosome analyses in buccal, peripheral blood, and spinal cord ligament tissues were consistent with the previous amniocentesis and CVS findings, and the degree of mosaicism varied from 25 to 80%. It is often challenging to pinpoint the chromosomal identity of sSMCs using banding cytogenetics. A combination of low-pass genome sequencing of cell-free DNA, chromosomal microarray, and FISH enabled the identification of the precise chromosomal rearrangement in this patient. This study adds to the growing list of clinically identified neocentric marker chromosomes and is the first described instance of partial tetrasomy 13q31q34 identified in a mosaic state prenatally. Since NIPS is now being routinely performed along with invasive testing for advanced maternal age, an increased prenatal detection rate for mosaic sSMCs in otherwise normal pregnancies is expected. Future studies investigating how neocentromeres mediate gene expression changes could help identify potential epigenetic targets as treatment options to rescue or reverse the phenotypes seen in patients with congenital neocentromeres.", "Keywords": ["13q31.1", "chromosomal microarray", "neocentromere", "non-invasive prenatal screening", "supernumerary marker chromosome"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Avinash V", "Last Name": "Dharmadhikari", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elaine M", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carli C", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Macera", "Affiliation": "Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Harkavy", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vaidehi", "Last Name": "Jobanputra", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brynn", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mythily", "Last Name": "Ganapathi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in genetics", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35926648", "Title": "Unified standard for fetal growth velocity: the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "United States", "Humans", "Female", "Pregnancy", "National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (U.S.)", "Fetal Development", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine L", "Last Name": "Grantz", "Affiliation": "Division of Population Health Research, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.

Phenotype-driven early genetic diagnosis of fetal genetic disease can help to strategize treatment options and clinical preventive measures during the perinatal period, to plan in utero therapies, and to inform parental decision-making. Fetal phenotypes of genetic diseases are often unique and at present are not well understood; more comprehensive knowledge about prenatal phenotypes and computational resources have an enormous potential to improve diagnostics and translational research. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has been widely used to support diagnostics and translational research in human genetics. To better support prenatal usage, the HPO consortium conducted a series of workshops with a group of domain experts in a variety of medical specialties, diagnostic techniques, as well as diseases and phenotypes related to prenatal medicine, including perinatal pathology, musculoskeletal anomalies, neurology, medical genetics, hydrops fetalis, craniofacial malformations, cardiology, neonatal-perinatal medicine, fetal medicine, placental pathology, prenatal imaging, and bioinformatics. We expanded the representation of prenatal phenotypes in HPO by adding 95 new phenotype terms under the Abnormality of prenatal development or birth (HP:0001197) grouping term, and revised definitions, synonyms, and disease annotations for most of the 152 terms that existed before the beginning of this effort. The expansion of prenatal phenotypes in HPO will support phenotype-driven prenatal exome and genome sequencing for precision genetic diagnostics of rare diseases to support prenatal care.",

Beneficial Effects of Antenatal Magnesium clinical trial was conducted between 1997 and 2007, and demonstrated a significant reduction in cerebral palsy (CP) in preterm infants who were exposed to peripartum magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). However, the mechanism by which MgSO4 confers neuroprotection remains incompletely understood. Cord blood samples from this study were interrogated during an era when next-generation sequencing was not widely accessible and few gene expression differences or biomarkers were identified between treatment groups. Our goal was to use bulk RNA deep sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes comparing the following four groups: newborns who ultimately developed CP treated with MgSO4 or placebo, and controls (newborns who ultimately did not develop CP) treated with MgSO4 or placebo. Those who died after birth were excluded. We found that MgSO4 upregulated expression of SCN5A only in the control group, with no change in gene expression in cord blood of newborns who ultimately developed CP. Regardless of MgSO4 exposure, expression of NPBWR1 and FTO was upregulated in cord blood of newborns who ultimately developed CP compared with controls. These data support that MgSO4 may not exert its neuroprotective effect through changes in gene expression. Moreover, NPBWR1 and FTO may be useful as biomarkers and may suggest new mechanistic pathways to pursue in understanding the pathogenesis of CP. The small number of cases ultimately available for this secondary analysis, with male predominance and mild CP phenotype, is a limitation of the study.

Although the placenta is critical to fetal development and later life health, it has not been integrated into largescale functional genomics initiatives, and mechanisms of birthweight-associated variants identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) are unclear. The goal of this study is to provide functional mechanistic insight into the causal pathway from a genetic variant to birthweight by integrating placental methylation and gene expression with established GWAS loci for birthweight. We identify placental DNA methylation and gene expression targets for several birthweight GWAS loci. The target genes are broadly enriched in cardiometabolic, immune response, and hormonal pathways. We find that methylation causally influences WNT3A, CTDNEP1, and RANBP2 expression in placenta.

To date, mechanisms behind normal and abnormal (premature or delayed) CR remain unclear. Recent studies show regional differences exist in human cervical tissue structure. While the entire cervix contains extracellular matrix (ECM), the internal os is highly cellular containing 50-60% cervical smooth muscle (CSM). The external os contains 10-20% CSM. Previously, we reported ECM rigidity and different ECM proteins influence CSM cell function, highlighting the importance of understanding not only how cervical cells orchestrate cervical ECM remodeling in pregnancy, but also how changes in specific ECM proteins can influence resident cellular function. To understand this dynamic process, we utilized a systematic proteomic approach to understand which soluble ECM and cellular proteins exist in the different regions of the human cervix and how the proteomic profiles change from the non-pregnant (NP) to the pregnant (PG) state. We found the human cervix proteome contains at least 4548 proteins and establish the types and relative abundance of cellular and soluble matrisome proteins found in the NP and PG human cervix. Further, we report the relative abundance of proteins involved with elastic fiber formation and ECM organization/degradation were significantly increased while proteins involved in RNA polymerase I/promoter opening, DNA methylation, senescence, immune system, and compliment activation were decreased in the PG compared to NP cervix. These findings establish an initial platform from which we can further comprehend how changes in the human cervix proteome results in normal and abnormal CR.", "Keywords": ["Cervical remodeling",

Objectives: To determine whether SDB in pregnancy and/or after delivery is associated with hypertension (HTN) and metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods: nuMoM2b-HHS (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study) (N\u2009=\u20094,508) followed participants initially recruited during their first pregnancy. Participants returned for a visit 2-7 years after pregnancy. This study examined a subgroup who underwent SDB assessments during their first pregnancy (n\u2009=\u20091,964) and a repeat SDB assessment after delivery (n\u2009=\u20091,222). Two SDB definitions were considered: 1) apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 and 2)\u00a0oxygen desaturation index (ODI)\u2009\u2a7e\u20095. Associations between SDB and incident HTN and MS were evaluated with adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). Measurements and Main Results: The aRR for MS given an AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 during pregnancy was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.93), but no association with HTN was found. ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was associated with both an increased risk for HTN (aRR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.30-3.14) and MS (aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.97). Participants with an AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy that persisted after delivery were at higher risk for both HTN (aRR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.84-7.73) and MS (aRR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.59-3.76). Similar associations were observed for persistent ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 after delivery. Conclusions: An AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of MS. An ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was significantly associated with both HTN and MS. Participants with persistent elevations in AHI and ODI during pregnancy and at 2-7 years after delivery were at the highest risk for HTN and MS.

We examined the relationships between prenatal maternal testosterone and estradiol at 19.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0weeks, cord blood testosterone and estradiol at birth, placental aromatase mRNA expression, and neurodevelopment using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 3rd Edition (BASC-3), and the Empathizing Quotient for Children (EQ-C) at 4.5-6.5\u00a0years of age in a sample of 270 Nulliparous-Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study participants. Maternal testosterone levels were positively associated with SCQ scores, but the association was not significant after adjusting for maternal age at delivery, nor was there a significant interaction with sex. Maternal estradiol levels were negatively associated with BASC-3 Clinical Probability scores among males (n\u00a0=\u00a0139). We report a significant interaction effect of cord blood testosterone and fetal sex on both total SCQ scores and t-scores on the Developmental Social Disorders subscale. Placental aromatase was not associated with any neurodevelopmental or hormone measure, but under conditions of low placental aromatase expression, high maternal testosterone was positively associated with SCQ scores in males (n\u00a0=\u00a046).

Few large U.S. population-based surveys included data on APOs. Methods: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study is a nationally representative survey of 45,971 U.S. respondents. Female respondents \u226550 years old who reported pregnancy history at the 2013-2014 baseline interview were included in this cross-sectional analysis (n\u2009=\u20093,175; weighted n\u2009=\u200935,783,619). The primary exposure was a history of \u22651 APO, including preterm delivery, low birth weight, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and stillbirth. The primary outcomes were (1) stroke before age 60 and (2) any stroke. We used weighted logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between APO and stroke, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parity, and vascular risk factors. Results: Among stroke-free respondents, 15% reported \u22651 APO. Among women who reported a stroke before age 60, 39% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009<\u20090.001); among women reporting stroke at any age, 25% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Controlling for covariates, women with APOs had increased odds of stroke before age 60 (adjusted OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.49, 4.75). The association of APOs with stroke at any age was not significant after controlling for covariates (adjusted OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93, 2.64). Conclusion: In this analysis of U.S. nationally representative survey data, APOs were independently associated with midlife stroke.

We examined associations of breastfeeding with childhood overweight, obesity, and percentage body fat, in a racially diverse maternal-child cohort. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 823 children, ages 4-8 years, enrolled in the Environmental Exposures and Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohort, a subset of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies cohort. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overweight [BMI (kg/m2) 85th to <95th percentile] and obesity (BMI \u226595th percentile) in relation to breastfeeding including duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding. Linear regression was used to evaluate association between breastfeeding and percentage body fat measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: Fifty-two percent of children were male, 32% non-Hispanic Black, 29% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic White, and 13% Asian; 16% were overweight and 13% obese. Six months of exclusive breastfeeding, compared with no breastfeeding, was associated with 60% lower odds of obesity (95% CI 0.18-0.91) adjusting for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, maternal BMI, and child's activity. Percentage body fat was inversely associated with breastfeeding duration. For none, <6, and \u22656 months of exclusive breastfeeding, adjusted mean percentage body fat was 16.8, 14.5, and 13.4, respectively.

distributed suspected obesogens that cross the placenta. However, few data are available to assess potential fetal effects of PFAS exposure on children's adiposity in diverse populations. To address the data gap, we estimated associations between gestational PFAS concentrations and childhood adiposity in a diverse mother-child cohort. We considered 6 PFAS in first trimester blood plasma, measured using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, collected from non-smoking women with low-risk singleton pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a0803). Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fat mass, fat-free mass, and % body fat were ascertained in 4-8 year old children as measures of adiposity. We estimated associations of individual gestational PFAS with children's adiposity and overweight/obesity, adjusted for confounders. There were more non-Hispanic Black (31.7\u00a0%) and Hispanic (42.6\u00a0%) children with overweight/obesity, than non-Hispanic white (18.2\u00a0%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (16.4\u00a0%) children (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; 5.3\u00a0ng/mL) and perfluorooctanoic acid (2.0\u00a0ng/mL) had the highest median concentrations in maternal blood. Among women without obesity (n\u00a0=\u00a0667), greater perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was associated with their children having higher WC z-score (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.08, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.14; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), fat mass (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.55\u00a0kg, 95%CI: 0.21, 0.90; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and % body fat (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u00a0%; 95%CI: 0.003, 0.01; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), although the association of PFUnDA with fat mass attenuated at the highest concentrations. Among women without obesity, the associations of PFAS and their children's adiposity varied significantly by self-reported race-ethnicity, although the direction of the associations was inconsistent. In contrast, among the children of women with obesity, greater, PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid concentrations were associated with less adiposity (n\u00a0=\u00a0136). Our results suggest that specific PFAS may be developmental obesogens, and that maternal race-ethnicity may be an important modifier of the associations among women without obesity.", "Keywords": ["Adiposity", "Children's health", "Health disparities", "Obesity", "Obesogen", "Perfluoroalkyl substances"], "MeSH terms": ["Adiposity", "Alkanesulfonic Acids", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Environmental Pollutants", "Female", "Fluorocarbons", "Humans", "Obesity", "Pregnancy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Bloom", "Affiliation": "Department of Global and Community Health, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA.

Using a cohort of 66 COVID-19-positive women in late pregnancy, we correlated clinical parameters with disease severity, placental histopathology, and the expression of viral entry and Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) antiviral transcripts. All newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the demographic parameters or placental histopathological characteristics were associated with disease severity. The fetal-maternal transfer ratio for IgG against the N or S viral proteins was commonly less than one, as recently reported. We found that the expression level of placental ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, was higher in women with severe COVID-19. Placental expression of IFITM1 and IFITM3, which have been implicated in antiviral response, was higher in participants with severe disease. We also showed that IFITM3 protein expression, which localized to early and late endosomes, was enhanced in severe COVID-19.

To determine how a low oxygen environment impacts Notch signaling and cellular motility, we utilized the human first trimester trophoblast cell line, HTR-8/SVneo. Gene set enrichment and ontology analyses identified pathways involved in angiogenesis, Notch and cellular migration as upregulated in HTR-8/SVneo cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. DAPT, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor that inhibits Notch activation, was used to interrogate the crosstalk between Notch and hypoxia pathways in HTR-8/SVneo cells. We found that hypoxia requires Notch activation to mediate HTR-8/SVneo cell migration, but not invasion. To determine if our in vitro findings were associated with preeclampsia, we analyzed the second trimester chorionic villous sampling (CVS) samples and third trimester placentas. We found a significant decrease in expression of migration and invasion genes in CVS from preeclamptic pregnancies and significantly lower levels of JAG1 in placentas from pregnancies with early-onset preeclampsia with severe features. Our data support a role for Notch in mediating hypoxia-induced trophoblast migration, which may contribute to preeclampsia development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cell Movement", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Jagged-1 Protein", "Placenta", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Pregnancy Trimester, Third", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "Trophoblasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Barry E", "Last Name": "Perlman", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey A", "Last Name": "Merriam", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Lemenze", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qingshi", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Salma", "Last Name": "Begum", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohan", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Division of Reproductive Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan K", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biophysics, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie J", "Last Name": "Shawber", "Affiliation": "Division of Reproductive Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nataki C", "Last Name": "Douglas", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Health, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, New Jersey, USA."}], "Journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2021May14"}, {"PMID": "33706345", "Title": "Association of Breastfeeding and Child IQ Score at Age 5 Years.", "Abstract": "To evaluate whether breastfeeding and its duration are associated with a reduced risk of low IQ scores or other neurodevelopmental problems.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Breast Feeding", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Wechsler Scales"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Beth A", "Last Name": "Plunkett", "Affiliation": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, University of Texas, Southwestern, Dallas, Texas, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, Columbia University, New York, New York, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, University of Texas, Houston, Houston, Texas, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, and University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;

Women with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) have increased cardiovascular risk, but the relationship of other factors is unknown. Methods and Results Among 4471 primiparous women, we related first-trimester atherogenic markers to risk of APO (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, small for gestational age), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertension (130/80\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or antihypertensive use) 2 to 7\u00a0years after delivery. Women with an APO/GDM (n=1102) had more atherogenic characteristics (obesity [34.2 versus 19.5%], higher blood pressure [systolic blood pressure 112.2 versus 108.4, diastolic blood pressure 69.2 versus 66.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg], glucose [5.0 versus 4.8\u00a0mmol/L], insulin [77.6 versus 60.1\u00a0pmol/L], triglycerides [1.4 versus 1.3\u00a0mmol/L], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [5.6 versus 4.0\u00a0nmol/L], and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [1.8 versus 1.9\u00a0mmol/L]; P<0.05) than women without an APO/GDM. They were also more likely to develop hypertension after delivery (32.8% versus 18.1%, P<0.05). Accounting for confounders and factors routinely assessed antepartum, higher glucose (relative risk [RR] 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06] per 0.6\u00a0mmol/L), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.11] per 2-fold higher), and triglycerides (RR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14-1.41] per 2-fold higher) were associated with later hypertension. Higher physical activity was protective (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87-0.99] per 3\u00a0h/week). When evaluated as latent profiles, the nonobese group with higher lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and insulin values (6.9% of the cohort) had increased risk of an APO/GDM and later hypertension. Among these factors, 7% to 15% of excess RR was related to APO/GDM. Conclusions Individual and combined first-trimester atherogenic characteristics are associated with APO/GDM occurrence and hypertension 2 to 7\u00a0years later.

Baseline data on predictors were collected from the women at time of recruitment. We used three different modeling strategies to address missing data due to biomarker values below the limit of detection (<LOD): (1) logistic regression models with biomarkers categorized as (<median, \u2265median); (2) linear regression models, imputing the <LOD values with (LOD/\u221a2); (3) regression models, considering <LOD values as left-censored. Generally, all three models identified similar predictors of exposure. We found that ethnicity, higher income and education predicted higher concentrations of most of the biomarkers in both cohorts. Mothers who consumed processed meat in the TDID cohort, and broiled, barbequed food or burgers in the S/H cohort, tended to have lower concentrations of organophosphates and 2,4-D.

Smooth Muscle Contractility-New Insights into Premature Cervical Failure and Spontaneous Preterm Birth.", "Abstract": "Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality, must involve premature cervical softening/dilation for a preterm vaginal delivery to occur. Yet, the mechanism behind premature cervical softening/dilation in humans remains unclear. We previously reported the non-pregnant human cervix contains considerably more cervical smooth muscle cells (CSMC) than historically appreciated and the CSMC organization resembles a sphincter. We hypothesize that premature cervical dilation leading to sPTB may be due to (1) an inherent CSMC contractility defect resulting in sphincter failure and/or (2) altered cervical extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity which influences CSMC contractility. To test these hypotheses, we utilized immunohistochemistry to confirm this CSMC phenotype persists in the human pregnant cervix and then assessed in vitro arrays of contractility (F:G actin ratios, PDMS pillar arrays) using primary CSMC from pregnant women with and without premature cervical failure (PCF). We show that CSMC from pregnant women with PCF do not have an inherent CSMC contractility defect but that CSMC exhibit decreased contractility when exposed to soft ECM. Given this finding, we used UPLC-ESI-MS/MS to evaluate collagen cross-link profiles in the cervical tissue from non-pregnant women with and without PCF and found that women with PCF have decreased collagen cross-link maturity ratios, which correlates to softer cervical tissue. These findings suggest having soft cervical ECM may lead to decreased CSMC contractile tone and a predisposition to sphincter laxity that contributes to sPTB. Further studies are needed to explore the interaction between cervical ECM properties and CSMC cellular behavior when investigating the pathophysiology of sPTB.", "Keywords": ["Cervix",

We asked whether C-RNA analysis could robustly detect aberrations in patients diagnosed with preeclampsia (PE), a prevalent and potentially fatal pregnancy complication. As an initial examination, we sequenced the circulating transcriptome from 40 pregnancies at the time of severe, early-onset PE diagnosis and 73 gestational age-matched controls. Differential expression analysis identified 30 transcripts with gene ontology annotations and tissue expression patterns consistent with the placental dysfunction, impaired fetal development, and maternal immune and cardiovascular system dysregulation characteristic of PE. Furthermore, machine learning identified combinations of 49 C-RNA transcripts that classified an independent cohort of patients (early-onset PE, n = 12; control, n = 12) with 85 to 89% accuracy.

reported case on March 1, 2020. The state is now the epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early case series with 7 coronavirus disease 2019-positive pregnant patients, 2 of whom were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after an initial asymptomatic presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals for more than 2 weeks, from March 13, 2020, to March 27, 2020. A total of 14 patients (32.6%) presented without any coronavirus disease 2019-associated viral symptoms and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions on March 22. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of\u00a0the other 29 patients (67.4%) who presented with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, 3 women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and another patient re-presented with worsening respiratory status requiring oxygen supplementation 6 days postpartum after a successful labor induction. There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Based on coronavirus disease 2019 disease severity characteristics by Wu and McGoogan, 37 women (86%) exhibited mild disease, 4 (9.3%) severe disease, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described in nonpregnant adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "novel coronavirus", "pregnancy"],

We implemented a protocol for single circulating trophoblast (SCT) testing using positive selection by magnetic-activated cell sorting and single-cell low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to detect fetal aneuploidies and copy-number variants (CNVs) at \u223c1 Mb resolution. In 95 validation cases, we identified on average 0.20 putative trophoblasts/mL, of which 55% were of high quality and scorable for both aneuploidy and CNVs. We emphasize the importance of analyzing individual cells because some cells are apoptotic, in S-phase, or otherwise of poor quality. When two or more high-quality trophoblast cells were available for singleton pregnancies, there was complete concordance between all trophoblasts unless there was evidence of confined placental mosaicism. SCT results were highly concordant with available clinical data from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis procedures. Although determining the exact sensitivity and specificity will require more data, this study further supports the potential for SCT testing to become a diagnostic prenatal test.", "Keywords": ["cell-based NIPT", "fetal", "mosaisicm", "noninvasive prenatal diagnosis", "single cell analysis", "trophoblast"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Chromosome Disorders", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Genetic Markers", "Humans", "Male", "Noninvasive Prenatal Testing", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Trophoblasts", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liesbeth", "Last Name": "Vossaert", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roseen", "Last Name": "Salman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne K", "Last Name": "McCombs", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vipulkumar", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunjing", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Mancini", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dean P", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Malovannaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brynn", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weimin", "Last Name": "Bi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Baylor Genetics, Houston, TX 77021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy M", "Last Name": "Breman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ignatia B", "Last Name": "Van den Veyver", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arthur L", "Last Name": "Beaudet", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

The objective of this study was to determine the association between outcomes in first pregnancies and subsequent cardiovascular health. Methods and Results The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study is a prospective observational cohort that followed 4484 women 2 to 7\u00a0years (mean 3.2\u00a0years) after their first pregnancy. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (defined as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, small-for-gestational-age birth, preterm birth, and stillbirth) were identified prospectively in 1017 of the women (22.7%) during this pregnancy. The primary outcome was incident hypertension (HTN). Women without adverse pregnancy outcomes served as controls. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs were adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index, insurance type, and race/ethnicity at enrollment during pregnancy. The overall incidence of HTN was 5.4% (95% CI 4.7% to 6.1%). Women with adverse pregnancy outcomes had higher adjusted risk of HTN at follow-up compared with controls (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-3.1). The association held for individual adverse pregnancy outcomes: any hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.6), preeclampsia (RR 2.8, 95% CI 2.0-4.0), and preterm birth (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.8). Women who had an indicated preterm birth and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had the highest risk of HTN (RR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.7). Conclusions Several pregnancy complications in the first pregnancy are associated with development of HTN 2 to 7\u00a0years later. Preventive care for women should include a detailed pregnancy history to aid in counseling about HTN risk.

origins of cardiovascular disease disparities. Premature aging of the placenta, a tissue that supports fetal growth and exhibits sex-specific epigenetic changes, is associated with pregnancy complications. Using DNA methylation-based age estimator, we investigated the sex-specific relationship of placental epigenetic aging with fetal growth across 13-40 weeks gestation, neonatal size, and risk of low birth weight. Placental epigenetic age acceleration (PAA), the difference between DNA methylation age and gestational age, was associated with reduced fetal weight among males but with increased fetal weight among females. PAA was inversely associated with fetal weight, abdominal circumference, and biparietal diameter at 32-40 weeks among males but was positively associated with all growth measures among females across 13-40 weeks. A 1-week increase in PAA was associated with 2-fold (95% CI 1.2, 3.2) increased odds for low birth weight and 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.1, 2.0) increased odds for small-for-gestational age among males.

Preterm birth is suspected to be caused by the premature softening and mechanical failure of the cervix. The objective of this paper is to measure the anisotropic mechanical properties of human cervical tissue using indentation and video extensometry. The human cervix is a layered structure, where its thick stromal core contains preferentially aligned collagen fibers embedded in a soft ground substance. The fiber composite nature of the tissue provides resistance to the complex three-dimensional loading environment of pregnancy. In this work, we detail an indentation mechanical test to obtain the force and deformation response during loading which closely matches in vivo conditions. We postulate a constitutive material model to describe the equilibrium material behavior to ramp-hold indentation, and we use an inverse finite element method based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to determine best-fit material parameters. We report the material properties of human cervical slices taken at different anatomical locations from women of different obstetric backgrounds. In this cohort of patients, the anterior internal os (the area where the cervix meets the uterus) of the cervix is stiffer than the anterior external os (the area closest to the vagina). The anatomic anterior and posterior quadrants of cervical tissue are more anisotropic than the left and right quadrants.

The decreasing cost and increasing ease of genetic sequencing have propelled the rise of precision medicine. Precision medicine aims to use genetic and other information to provide care tailored to the individual patient, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and minimizing unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Although developments in genetic sequencing have the potential to transform clinical care, there are important limitations, including uncertainty in the clinical interpretation of many genetic variants and concerns about privacy, discrimination, and cost. To help clinicians understand the basics of genetic sequencing and how to apply it in clinical practice, Annals of Internal Medicine is launching a new \"Precision Medicine\" series. This introduction provides a general overview of clinical sequencing, with a focus on germline variation. Subsequent articles will use a case-based format to provide concise summaries of specific clinical precision medicine scenarios that are relevant to the practice of internal medicine. These cases will highlight specific clinical indications; interpretation of genetic test results; and ethical, legal, cost, and privacy issues related to genetic testing. The goal is to provide practical information on the appropriate application and interpretation of genomics in routine clinical practice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Databases, Nucleic Acid", "Genetic Carrier Screening", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Privacy", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Incidental Findings", "Insurance Coverage", "Insurance, Health", "Internal Medicine", "Precision Medicine", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Uncertainty"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Rowe", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York (J.W.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}], "Journal": "Annals of internal medicine", "PubDate": "2019May07"}, {"PMID": "30978205", "Title": "Effects of repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of preterm birth: An individual participant data meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Infants born preterm compared with infants born at term are at an increased risk of dying and of serious morbidities in early life, and those who survive have higher rates of neurological impairments.

Here we report on the development and validation of, and early clinical experience with, a new approach for non-invasive prenatal sequencing for a panel of causative genes for frequent dominant monogenic diseases. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from maternal plasma was barcoded, enriched, and then analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for targeted regions. Low-level fetal variants were identified by a statistical analysis adjusted for NGS read count and fetal fraction. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were confirmed by a secondary amplicon-based test on cfDNA. Clinical tests were performed on 422 pregnancies with or without abnormal ultrasound findings or family history. Follow-up studies on cases with available outcome results confirmed 20 true-positive, 127 true-negative, zero false-positive, and zero-false negative results. The initial clinical study demonstrated that this non-invasive test can provide valuable molecular information for the detection of a wide spectrum of dominant monogenic diseases, complementing

For this reason, an analysis of the effects of genetic variation on gene expression and DNA methylation in human placentas at high resolution and whole-genome coverage will have multiple mechanistic and practical implications. By producing and analyzing DNA sequence variation (n = 303), DNA methylation (n = 303) and mRNA expression data (n = 80) from placentas from healthy women, we investigate the regulatory landscape of the human placenta and offer analytical approaches to integrate different types of genomic data and address some potential limitations of current platforms. We distinguish two profiles of interaction between expression and DNA methylation, revealing linear or bimodal effects, reflecting differences in genomic context, transcription factor recruitment, and possibly cell subpopulations. These findings help to clarify the interactions of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in normal human placentas. They also provide strong evidence for genotype-driven modifications of transcription and DNA methylation in normal placentas. In addition to these mechanistic implications, the data and analytical methods presented here will improve the interpretability of genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies for human traits and diseases that involve placental functions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Binding Sites", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Gene

Non-invasive prenatal screening using cell free DNA (cfDNA) may either screen for common aneuploidies alone or include chromosomal microdeletions.

In addition, since fetal fraction plays a significant role in the reliability of results, this should also be reported with all test results. Chromosomal microarray addresses significant clinically relevant information beyond that detected with standard karyotype testing but may, in less than one percent of cases, result in a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Laboratories should indicate their policies for reporting these VUS findings. In addition, physicians using this testing should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the laboratory platforms.

Consensus guidelines continue to recommend a 4- to 12-week postpartum 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) despite persistent reports that only 35% of women complete the test. Physician ordering rates can improve, but the largest barriers to postpartum testing are clearly patient-related. Initiatives to improve OGTT testing rates have been only moderately effective and required allocation of staff time, diverting resources from other clinical areas. Alternative testing models using single-draw tests that bypass patient barriers show promise for improving the diagnosis of postpregnancy dysglycemia. Specifically, evidence is emerging in the pregnant and nonpregnant populations that, compared with the OGTT, the single-draw hemoglobin A1C test may identify more patients with prediabetes, bypasses patient barriers to testing such as the need for fasting, and has less laboratory variation compared with the OGTT or fasting plasma glucose. The risk-benefit focus should shift from comparing individual test performance statistics presuming the OGTT to be the \"gold standard\" to data reporting the ability of a test to facilitate identification of patients.

In the prenatal setting, CMA is on par with traditional karyotyping for detection of major chromosomal imbalances such as aneuploidy and unbalanced rearrangements. CMA offers additional diagnostic benefits by revealing sub-microscopic imbalances or copy number variations that are too small to be seen on a standard G-banded chromosome preparation. These submicroscopic imbalances are also referred to as microdeletions and microduplications, particularly when they include specific genomic regions that are associated with clinical sequelae. Not all microdeletions/duplications are associated with adverse clinical phenotypes and in many cases, their presence is benign. In other cases, they are associated with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that may range from benign to severe, while in some situations, the clinical significance may simply be unknown. These scenarios present a challenge for prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling prior to prenatal CMA greatly facilitates delivery of complex results. In prenatal diagnostic samples with a normal karyotype, chromosomal microarray will diagnose a clinically significant subchromosomal deletion or duplication in approximately 1% of structurally normal pregnancies and 6% with a structural anomaly.

Here, we report nine individuals with NEDBEH who carry partial deletions or deleterious sequence variants in RERE. These variants were found to be de novo in all cases in which parental samples were available. An analysis of data from individuals with NEDBEH suggests that point mutations affecting the Atrophin-1 domain of RERE are associated with an increased risk of structural eye defects, congenital heart defects, renal anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss when compared with loss-of-function variants that are likely to lead to haploinsufficiency. A high percentage of RERE pathogenic variants affect a histidine-rich region in the Atrophin-1 domain. We have also identified a recurrent two-amino-acid duplication in this region that is associated with the development of a CHARGE syndrome-like phenotype. We conclude that mutations affecting RERE result in a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist and can be used to guide medical decision making.

Systematic Review of Validation Studies.", "Abstract": "The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) in pregnancy is essential to guide medical decision making that affects both mother and fetus. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the accuracy of ambulatory, home, and clinic BP measurement devices in pregnant women. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL EBSCO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and dabl from inception through August 3, 2017 for articles that assessed the validity of an upper arm BP measurement device against a mercury sphygmomanometer in pregnant women. Two independent investigators determined eligibility, extracted data, and adjudicated protocol violations. From 1798 potential articles identified, 41, that assessed 28 devices, met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (n=32) followed a standard or modified American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization, British Hypertension Society, or European Society of Hypertension validation protocol. Several articles described the results of validation studies performed on >1 device (n=7) or in >1 population of pregnant women (n=12), comprising 64 pairwise validity assessments. The device was validated in 61% (32 of 52) of studies which used a standard or modified protocol. Only 34% (11 of 32) of the studies wherein the device was successfully validated were performed without a protocol violation. Given the implications of inaccurate BP measurement in pregnant women, healthcare providers should be aware of and try to use the BP measurement devices which have been properly validated in this population.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "blood pressure monitors", "hypertension", "preeclampsia", "pregnancy", "sphygmomanometers"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure

In several small series, prenatal whole exome sequencing (WES) approaches have identified genetic diagnoses when conventional tests (karyotype and microarray) were not diagnostic. Here, we review published prenatal WES studies and recent conference abstracts. Thirty-one studies were identified, with diagnostic rates in series of five or more fetuses varying between 6.2% and 80%. Differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to sequencing largely account for the wide range of diagnostic rates. The data suggest that diagnostic yields will be greater in fetuses with multiple anomalies or in cases preselected following genetic review. Beyond its ability to improve diagnostic rates, we explore the potential of WES to improve understanding of prenatal presentations of genetic disorders and lethal fetal syndromes. We discuss prenatal phenotyping limitations, counselling challenges regarding variants of uncertain significance, incidental and secondary findings, and technical problems in WES. We review the practical, ethical, social and economic issues that must be considered before prenatal WES could become part of routine testing. Finally, we reflect upon the potential future of prenatal genetic diagnosis, including a move towards whole genome sequencing and non-invasive whole exome and whole genome testing. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Congenital Abnormalities", "Female", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sunayna", "Last Name": "Best", "Affiliation": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Wou", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neeta", "Last Name": "Vora", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ignatia B", "Last Name": "Van der Veyver", "Affiliation": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lyn S", "Last Name": "Chitty", "Affiliation": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}], "Journal": "Prenatal diagnosis", "PubDate": "2018Jan"}, {"PMID": "28623973", "Title": "Dynamic maternal and fetal Notch activity and expression in placentation.", "Abstract": "Murine placentation requires trophoblast Notch2, while the Notch ligand, JAGGED1, is reduced in invasive trophoblasts from women with preeclampsia.

The mechanical functions of the uterus, fetal membranes, and cervix have dynamic roles to protect the fetus during gestation. To understand their mechanical function and relation to preterm birth, we built a three-dimensional parameterized finite element model of pregnancy. This model is generated by an automated procedure that is informed by maternal ultrasound measurements. A baseline model at 25 weeks of gestation was characterized, and to visualize the impact of cervical structural parameters on tissue stretch, we evaluated the model sensitivity to (1) anterior uterocervical angle, (2) cervical length, (3) posterior cervical offset, and (4) cervical stiffness. We found that cervical tissue stretching is minimal when the cervical canal is aligned with the longitudinal uterine axis, and a softer cervix is more sensitive to changes in the geometric variables tested.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cervix Uteri", "Female", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Pregnancy", "Ultrasonography", "Uterus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea R", "Last Name": "Westervelt", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 e-mail: arw2181@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Fernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 e-mail: mjf2152@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111 e-mail: mhouse@tuftsmedicalcenter.org."}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 e-mail: jyv2101@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Ling", "Last Name": "Nhan-Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 e-mail: cn2281@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 e-mail: rw2181@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "Mem.

Collagen fibers in the cervical extracellular matrix exhibit preferential directionality, and this collagen network ultrastructure is hypothesized to reorient and remodel during cervical softening and dilation at time of parturition. Within the cervix, the upper half is substantially loaded during pregnancy and is where the premature funneling starts to happen. To characterize the cervical collagen ultrastructure for the upper half of the human cervix, we imaged whole axial tissue slices from non-pregnant and pregnant women undergoing hysterectomy or cesarean hysterectomy respectively using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and implemented a pixel-wise fiber orientation tracking method to measure the distribution of fiber orientation. The collagen fiber orientation maps show that there are two radial zones and the preferential fiber direction is circumferential in a dominant outer radial zone. The OCT data also reveal that there are two anatomic regions with distinct fiber orientation and dispersion properties. These regions are labeled: Region 1-the posterior and anterior quadrants in the outer radial zone and Region 2-the left and right quadrants in the outer radial zone and all quadrants in the inner radial zone. When comparing samples from nulliparous vs multiparous women, no differences in these fiber properties were noted. Pregnant tissue samples exhibit an overall higher fiber dispersion and more heterogeneous fiber properties within the sample than non-pregnant tissue. Collectively, these OCT data suggest that collagen fiber dispersion and directionality may play a role in cervical remodeling during pregnancy, where distinct remodeling properties exist according to anatomical quadrant.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Cervix Uteri", "Collagen", "Female", "Humans", "Parity", "Pregnancy", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors":

While NIPT is highly sensitive and specific, false positive results can occur. One important cause of false positive results is confined placental mosaicism (CPM). This can occur through a mitotic nondisjunction event or through aneuploidy rescue. CPM is usually associated with normal fetal outcomes, but has been associated with intrauterine growth restriction, pregnancy loss, or perinatal death in some cases. CPM may also be a marker for uniparental disomy. Given that NIPT can result in false positives, positive results should be confirmed with invasive testing before any irreversible procedure is performed. Whether to perform CVS or amniocentesis to confirm a positive NIPT result is controversial. While CVS can be performed earlier than amniocentesis, CPM can also cause false positive results. Our practice is to proceed with CVS, and to examine all cell lines using both an uncultured sample using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or short-term culture, as well as long-term culture of the sample. If the results all show aneuploidy, the results are reported to the patient. Otherwise, if the results are also mosaic, amniocentesis is recommended and analyzed by both FISH and karyotype. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Keywords": ["NIPT", "genetics", "prenatal diagnosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Amniocentesis", "Aneuploidy", "Chorionic Villi Sampling", "False Positive Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Mosaicism", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Mardy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Noninvasive prenatal screening of cell-free DNA has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 superior to all previous screening approaches with slightly lower performance for other common aneuploidies. These tests have rapidly captured an increasing market share, with substantial reductions in the number of chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis performed suggesting that physicians and patients regard such screening approaches as an equivalent replacement for diagnostic testing. Simultaneously, many clinical programs have noted significant decreases in patient counseling. In 2012 the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded a blinded comparison of karyotype with the emerging technology of array comparative genomic hybridization showing that in patients with a normal karyotype, 2.5% had a clinically relevant microdeletion or duplication identified. In pregnancies with an ultrasound-detected structural anomaly, 6% had an incremental finding, and of those with a normal scan, 1.6% had a copy number variant. For patients of any age with a normal ultrasound and karyotype, the chance of a pathogenic copy number variant is greater than 1%, similar to the age-related risk of aneuploidy in the fetus of a 38 year old. This risk is 4-fold higher than the risk of trisomy 21 in a woman younger than 30 years and 5- to 10-fold higher than the present accepted risk of a diagnostic procedure.

Methods\u2003Secondary analysis of low-risk nulliparas enrolled in a multicenter preeclampsia prevention trial. HOMA:IR was measured on fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations among low-risk nulliparas between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation. Median HOMA:IR was compared between women who did and did not develop puerperal infection using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results\u2003Of 1,180 women with fasting glucose and insulin available, 121 (10.3%) had a puerperal infection.

Rodent models offer advantages including accurately timed pregnant tissues and genetically altered models. Determining the material properties of the mouse cervix, however, is challenging because of its small size and complex geometry. The aim of this study is to quantify cervical material property changes in a normal mouse pregnancy using a microstructurally-inspired porous fiber composite model. We mechanically test intact, whole, gestation-timed mouse cervix by pulling apart tensioned sutures through its inner canal. To interpret our mechanical testing results, we conduct an inverse finite element analysis, taking into account the combined loading state of the thick-walled cylindrical tissue. We fit the material model to previous osmotic swelling data and load-deformation data from this study using a nonlinear optimization scheme, and validate the model by predicting a separate set of deformation data. Overall, the proposed porous fiber composite model captures the mechanical behavior of the mouse cervix in large deformation. The evolution of cervical material parameters indicates that in a normal mouse pregnancy, the cervix begins to soften between day 6 and day 12 of a 19-day gestation period. The material parameter associated with the collagen fiber stiffness decreases from 3.4MPa at gestation day 6 to 9.7e-4MPa at gestation day 18, while the ground substance stiffness decreases from 2.6e-1MPa to 7.0e-4MPa.", "Keywords": ["Biomechanics", "Cervix", "Constitutive modeling", "Pregnancy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cervix Uteri", "Elasticity", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Pregnancy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mala", "Last Name": "Mahendroo", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We interviewed 28 women and 12 male partners after receiving positive results and analyzed the transcripts to assess their understanding and level of concern about the expected clinical implications of results. Participant descriptions were compared to the original laboratory interpretation. When diagnosed prenatally, couples' understanding of the nature and consequences of copy number variants (CNVs) impacts decision-making and concern. Findings suggest women, but less so partners, generally understand the nature and clinical implications of prenatal CMA results. Couples feel reassured, perhaps sometimes falsely so, when a CNV is inherited from a \"normal\" parent and experience considerable uncertainty when a CNV is de novo, frequently precipitating a search for additional information and guidance. Five factors influenced participants' concern including: the pattern of inheritance, type of possible phenotypic involvement, perceived manageability of outcomes, availability and strength of evidence about outcomes associated with the CNV, and provider messages about continuing the pregnancy. A good understanding of results is vital as couples decide whether or not to continue with their pregnancy and seek additional information to assist in pregnancy decision-making.", "Keywords": ["Copy number variant", "Genetic counseling", "Microarray analysis", "Prenatal testing", "Understanding"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Chromosomes, Human", "Comprehension", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Decision Making", "Female", "Genetic Counseling", "Humans", "Male", "Microarray Analysis", "Middle Aged", "Parents", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Walser", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. sarah.walser@uphs.upenn.edu."}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "Werner-Lin", "Affiliation": "School of Social Policy and Practice, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amita", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara A", "Last Name": "Bernhardt", "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of genetic counseling", "PubDate": "2016Oct"}, {"PMID": "26825925", "Title": "Pregnancy as a Window to Future Cardiovascular Health: Design and Implementation of the nuMoM2b Heart Health Study.", "Abstract": "The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study-Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) Heart Health Study (HHS) was designed to investigate the relationships between adverse pregnancy outcomes and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The ongoing nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8 centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward.

The underlying cervical collagen ultrastructure, which influences the overall mechanical properties of the cervix, plays a role in maintaining a successful pregnancy until term. Yet, not much is known about this collagen ultrastructure in pregnant and nonpregnant human tissue. We used optical coherence tomography to investigate the directionality and dispersion of collagen fiber bundles in the human cervix. An image analysis tool has been developed, combining a stitching method with a fiber orientation measurement, to study axially sliced cervix samples. This tool was used to analyze the ultrastructure of ex-vivo pregnant and non-pregnant hysterectomy tissue samples taken at the internal os, which is the region of the cervix adjacent to the uterus. With this tool, directionality maps of collagen fiber bundles and dispersion of collagen fiber orientation were analyzed. It was found that that the overall preferred directionality of the collagen fibers for both the nonpregnant and pregnant samples were circling around the inner cervical canal. Pregnant samples showed greater dispersion than non-pregnant samples. Lastly, we observed regional differences in collagen fiber dispersion.

At the end of pregnancy, however, the cervix must allow delivery, which requires it to markedly soften, shorten and dilate. There are multiple pathways to spontaneous preterm birth, the leading global cause of death in children less than 5 years old, but all culminate in premature cervical change, because that is the last step in the final common pathway to delivery. The mechanisms underlying premature cervical change in pregnancy are poorly understood, and therefore current clinical protocols to assess preterm birth risk are limited to surrogate markers of mechanical function, such as sonographically measured cervical length. This is what motivates us to study the cervix, for which we propose investigating clinical cervical function in parallel with a quantitative engineering evaluation of its structural function. We aspire to develop a common translational language, as well as generate a rigorous integrated clinical-engineering framework for assessing cervical mechanical function at the cellular to organ level. In this review, we embark on that challenge by describing the current landscape of clinical, biochemical, and engineering concepts associated with the mechanical function of the cervix during pregnancy.

To understand the role of cervical material properties in preventing preterm birth, we derive a cervical material model based on previous mechanical, biochemical and histological experiments conducted on nonpregnant and pregnant human hysterectomy cervical tissue samples. In this study we present a three-dimensional fiber composite model that captures the equilibrium material behavior of the tissue in tension and compression. Cervical tissue is modeled as a fibrous composite material, where a single family of preferentially aligned and continuously distributed collagen fibers are embedded in a compressible neo-Hookean ground substance. The total stress in the collagen solid network is calculated by integrating the fiber stresses. The shape of the fiber distribution is described by an ellipsoid where semi-principal axis lengths are fit to optical coherence tomography measurements. The composite material model is fit to averaged mechanical testing data from uni-axial compression and tension experiments, and averaged material parameters are reported for nonpregnant and term pregnant human cervical tissue. The model is then evaluated by investigating the stress and strain state of a uniform thick-walled cylinder under a compressive stress with collagen fibers preferentially aligned in the circumferential direction.

crosslinks and corresponding tensile mechanical properties in mouse cervical tissue during normal pregnancy.", "Abstract": "The changes in the mechanical integrity of the cervix during pregnancy have implications for a successful delivery. Cervical collagens are known to remodel extensively in mice with progressing gestation leading to a soft cervix at term. During this process, mature crosslinked collagens are hypothesized to be replaced with immature less crosslinked collagens to facilitate cervical softening and ripening. To determine the mechanical role of collagen crosslinks during normal mouse cervical remodeling, tensile load-to-break tests were conducted for the following time points: nonpregnant (NP), gestation day (d) 6, 12, 15, 18 and 24 hr postpartum (PP) of the 19-day gestation period. Immature crosslinks (HLNL and DHLNL) and mature crosslinks (DPD and PYD) were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). There were no significant changes in the total immature crosslink density (HLNL+DHLNL mol per collagen mol) throughout normal mouse gestation (range: 0.31-0.49). Total mature crosslink density (PYD+DPD mol per collagen mol) decreased significantly in early softening from d6 to d15 (d6: 0.17, d12: 0.097, d15: 0.026) and did not decrease with further gestation. The maturity ratio (total mature to total immature crosslinks) significantly decreased in early softening from d6 to d15 (d6: 0.2, d15: 0.074). All of the measured crosslinks correlated significantly with a measure of tissue stiffness and strength, with the exception of the immature crosslink HLNL. This data provides quantitative evidence to support the hypothesis that as mature crosslinked collagens decline, they are replaced by immature collagens to facilitate increased tissue compliance in the early softening period from d6 to d15.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cervix Uteri", "Collagen", "Cross-Linking Reagents", "Dipeptides", "Female", "Mice", "Pregnancy", "Tensile Strength"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America; Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "MiJung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Opthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America; Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "Department of Opthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mala", "Last Name": "Mahendroo", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "25281365", "Title": "A systematic evaluation of collagen cross-links in the human cervix.", "Abstract": "The mechanical strength of the cervix relies on the cross-linking of the tissue's collagen network.

Central to these advances has been the implementation of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Microdeletions and microduplications, undetectable by traditional karyotyping, have recently been confirmed to play a role in altered neurocognitive development. CMA is now recommended for fetuses with structural anomalies. However, CMA comes with an increased need and role for genetic counseling, because the potential genomic information available is exponentially increased. CMA also can be performed on a small number of preimplantation embryonic cells for assessment of the embryo's reproductive potential. Implementation of these new genomic techniques in an in vitro fertilization setting has already demonstrated significant improvements in reproductive outcome. Techniques are now being developed to eliminate the necessity for invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures. Currently in its infancy, noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA from maternal blood has already improved the sensitivity for detection of the common aneuploidies and current efforts are focused on identifying select microdeletions. The explosion of new genomic technologies continues to offer great benefits.

Recognizing that uncertain results will be encountered frequently as more of the genome is assayed prenatally, we set out to understand the experiences and needs of genetic counselors when counseling patients about uncertain prenatal microarray results, their comfort with various aspects of prenatal genetic counseling, and their interest in additional education and training about prenatal microarray testing. We first interviewed 10 genetic counselors about their experiences of providing pre- and post-test genetic counseling about prenatal CMA. Based on the findings from the counselor interviews, we developed items for a survey to assess the prevalence of genetic counselors' attitudes towards, experience and comfort with, and educational needs regarding prenatal CMA. Based on surveys completed by 193 prenatal genetic counselors, we found that when there is an uncertain CMA result, only 59% would be comfortable providing genetic counseling and only 43% would be comfortable helping a patient make a decision about pregnancy termination. Being less comfortable was associated with seeing fewer patients having prenatal CMA testing.

Premature cervical shortening resulting from premature cervical remodeling and alterations of cervical material properties are known to increase a woman\u05f3s risk of preterm birth (PTB). To understand the mechanical role of the cervix during pregnancy and to potentially develop indentation techniques for in vivo diagnostics to identify women who are at risk for premature cervical remodeling and thus preterm birth, we developed a spherical indentation technique to measure the time-dependent material properties of human cervical tissue taken from patients undergoing hysterectomy. In this study we present an inverse finite element analysis (IFEA) that optimizes material parameters of a viscoelastic material model to fit the stress-relaxation response of excised tissue slices to spherical indentation. Here we detail our IFEA methodology, report compressive viscoelastic material parameters for cervical tissue slices from nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant (PG) hysterectomy patients, and report slice-by-slice data for whole cervical tissue specimens. The material parameters reported here for human cervical tissue can be used to model the compressive time-dependent behavior of the tissue within a small strain regime of 25%.", "Keywords": ["Biomechanics", "Cervix", "Indentation", "Viscoelastic"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cervix Uteri", "Compressive Strength", "Elasticity", "Female", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Viscosity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wang", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyoko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Fernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cande V", "Last Name": "Ananth", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle L", "Last Name": "Oyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Changes in the mechanical properties of cervical tissue during remodeling are hypothesized to be related to the types of collagen crosslinks within the tissue. To further understand normal and abnormal cervical remodeling, we quantify the material properties and collagen crosslink density of cervical tissue throughout pregnancy from normal wild-type and Anthrax Toxin Receptor 2 knockout (Antxr2-/-) mice. Antxr2-/- females are known to have a parturition defect, in part, due to an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the cervix, particularly collagen. In this study, we determined the mechanical properties in gestation-timed cervical samples by osmotic loading and measured the density of mature collagen crosslink, pyridinoline (PYD), by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). The equilibrium material response of the tissue to loading was investigated using a hyperelastic material model where the stresses in the material are balanced by the osmotic swelling tendencies of the glycosaminoglycans and the tensile restoring forces of a randomly-oriented crosslinked collagen fiber network. This study shows that the swelling response of the cervical tissue increased with decreasing PYD density in normal remodeling. In the Antxr2-/- mice, there was no significant increase in swelling volume or significant decrease in crosslink density with advancing gestation. By comparing the ECM-mechanical response relationships in normal and disrupted parturition mouse models this study shows that a reduction of collagen crosslink density is related to cervical softening and contributes to the cervical remodeling process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Cervix Uteri", "Computer Simulation", "Elastic Modulus", "Extracellular Matrix", "Female", "Fibrillar Collagens", "Hardness", "Humans", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Biological", "Parturition", "Pregnancy", "Receptors, Peptide", "Viscosity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Reeves", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24345080", "Title": "Haptoglobin phenotype and abnormal uterine artery Doppler in a racially diverse cohort.", "Abstract": "The anti-oxidant and proangiogenic protein haptoglobin (Hp) is believed to be important for implantation and pregnancy, although its specific role is not known.

We identified loci with strong ASM in human tissues from methylation-sensitive SNP array data. Two index regions (bisulfite PCR amplicons), one between the C3orf27 and RPN1 genes in chromosome band 3q21 and the other near the VTRNA2-1 vault RNA in band 5q31, proved to be new examples of imprinted DMRs (maternal alleles methylated) while a third, between STEAP3 and C2orf76 in chromosome band 2q14, showed non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Using long-read bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) in 8 human tissues we found that in all 3 domains the ASM is restricted to single differentially methylated regions (DMRs), each less than 2kb. The ASM in the C3orf27-RPN1 intergenic region was placenta-specific and associated with allele-specific expression of a long non-coding RNA. Strikingly, the discrete DMRs in all 3 regions overlap with binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF, which we found selectively bound to the unmethylated allele of the STEAP3-C2orf76 DMR. Methylation mapping in two additional genes with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM, ELK3 and CYP2A7, showed that the CYP2A7 DMR also overlaps a CTCF site. Thus, two features of imprinted domains, highly localized DMRs and allele-specific insulator occupancy by CTCF, can also be found in chromosomal domains with non-imprinted ASM. Arguing for biological importance, our analysis of published whole genome bis-seq data from hES cells revealed multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks near CTCF binding sites with ASM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases", "Blood Proteins", "CCCTC-Binding Factor", "Chromosomes", "Cytochrome P450 Family 2", "DNA Methylation", "Fetal Proteins", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomic Imprinting", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Oncogene Proteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Repressor Proteins", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anupam", "Last Name": "Paliwal", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alexis M", "Last Name": "Temkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristi", "Last Name": "Kerkel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Yale", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iveta", "Last Name": "Yotova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Drost", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Lax", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chia-Ling", "Last Name": "Nhan-Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alain", "Last Name": "Borczuk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abraham", "Last Name": "Aviv", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Nagy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Schork", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Torkamani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Tycko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23958649", "Title": "Adherence to criteria for transvaginal ultrasound imaging and\u00a0measurement of cervical length.", "Abstract": "Adherence to published criteria for transvaginal imaging and measurement of cervical length is uncertain.

It must be strong to retain the fetus throughout gestation and then undergo a remodeling and softening process before labor for delivery of the fetus. It is believed that cervical insufficiency (CI), a condition in pregnancy resulting in preterm birth (PTB), is related to a cervix with compromised mechanical strength which cannot resist deformation caused by external forces generated by the growing fetus. Such PTBs are responsible for infant developmental problems and in severe cases infant mortality. To understand the etiologies of CI, our overall research goal is to investigate the mechanical behavior of the cervix. Permeability is a mechanical property of hydrated collagenous tissues that dictates the time-dependent response of the tissue to mechanical loading. The goal of this study was to design a novel soft tissue permeability testing device and to present direct hydraulic permeability measurements of excised nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant (PG) human cervical tissue from women with different obstetric histories. Results of hydraulic permeability testing indicate repeatability for specimens from single patients, with an order of magnitude separating the NP and PG group means (2.1\u2003\u00b1\u20031.4\u00d710(-14) and 3.2\u2003\u00b1\u20034.8\u00d710(-13)m(4)/N[middle dot]s, respectively), and large variability within the NP and PG sample groups. Differences were found between samples with similar obstetric histories, supporting the view that medical history may not be a good predictor of permeability (and therefore mechanical behavior) and highlighting the need for patient-specific measurements of cervical mechanical properties. The permeability measurements from this study will be used in future work to model the constitutive material behavior of cervical tissue and to develop in vivo diagnostic tools to stage the progression of labor.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cervix Uteri", "Female", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Middle Aged", "Permeability", "Pregnancy", "Young
