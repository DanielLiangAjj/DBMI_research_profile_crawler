In this report, we describe a novel variant in COL4A2 identified in a 48-year-old woman and her 15-year-old daughter. Funduscopic examination demonstrated significant venous and arteriolar tortuosity. Genetic testing revealed a novel variant, c.2321G>A:p.(Gly774Glu), in COL4A2. This vascular phenotype is similar to the familial retinal arterial tortuosity seen in COL4A2-associated Gould syndrome with additional venous involvement.

The reason for the low incidence in the palpebral skin has not been elucidated. In this study, we analyze the histopathologic features of an illustrative case of dermatofibroma and review previously published cases to determine whether eyelid dermatofibroma develops differently from the prototypical dermatofibroma. Methods: Histopathologic analysis of a new illustrative case of eyelid dermatofibroma and retrospective review of published cases. Results: The distinguishing features of the illustrative lesion included a rounder gross appearance, nonacanthotic epithelium, basophilic staining, cellular character, and a paucity of \"collagen trapping.\" These features deviated from the typical features associated with classic dermatofibroma. Review of the 11 previously published cases of eyelid dermatofibroma revealed that they were more similar in appearance to the illustrative lesion than to classic dermatofibroma. Discussion: The rarity and histological deviations of the eyelid dermatofibroma suggest that the dermal substrate from which the lesion develops differs from that of the classic dermatofibroma. This difference may be explained microanatomically based on the fact that the dermis of the eyelid is predominantly papillary, whereas the dermis of extrapalpebral skin where dermatofibromas are more common is predominantly reticular. Conclusions: Although related, eyelid dermatofibromas appear to be histologically distinct from classic dermatofibromas, owing to the unique dermal composition of the site of origin.", "Keywords": ["Dermatofibroma", "fibroblast", "reticular dermis"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Biopsy", "Eyelid Neoplasms", "Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Retrospective Studies", "Skin Neoplasms", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aliaa H", "Last Name": "Abdelhakim", "Affiliation": "a Edward Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristen E", "Last Name": "Dunbar", "Affiliation": "a Edward Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyle J", "Last Name": "Godfrey", "Affiliation": "a Edward Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Abascal Ananza", "Affiliation": "a Edward Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "David N", "Last Name": "Silvers", "Affiliation": "b Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kazim", "Affiliation": "a Edward Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York , USA."}], "Journal": "Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "30148725", "Title": "Neuroretinitis: a review.", "Abstract": "Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory disorder of the eye presenting with optic disc edema and the delayed development of a macular star secondary to optic nerve swelling toward the macular structures.

The Mfrp rd6 /Mfrp rd6 mouse is used as a pre-clinical animal model of retinal degeneration, and we found it was also hyperopic. To test the effect of restoring Mfrp expression, we delivered a wild-type Mfrp to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) of Mfrp rd6 /Mfrp rd6 mice via adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy. Phenotypic rescue was evaluated using non-invasive, human clinical testing, including fundus auto-fluorescence, optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and ultrasound. These analyses showed gene therapy restored retinal function and normalized axial length. Proteomic analysis of RPE tissue revealed rescue of specific proteins associated with eye growth and normal retinal and RPE function.

We label with distinct fluorescent tags the DLP and each of the two outer-layer proteins and track the fates of each species as the particles bind and enter BSC-1 cells. Virions attach to their glycolipid receptors in the host cell membrane and rapidly become inaccessible to externally added agents; most particles that release their DLP into the cytosol have done so by \u223c 10 minutes, as detected by rapid diffusional motion of the DLP away from residual outer-layer proteins. Electron microscopy shows images of particles at various stages of engulfment into tightly fitting membrane invaginations, consistent with the interpretation that rotavirus particles drive their own uptake.
