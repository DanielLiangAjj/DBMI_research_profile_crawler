How MECP2 contributes to transcriptional regulation in normal and disease states is unresolved; it has been reported to be an activator and a repressor. We describe here the first integrated CUT&Tag, transcriptome, and proteome analyses using human neurons with wild-type (WT) and mutant MECP2 molecules. MECP2 occupies CpG-rich promoter-proximal regions in over four thousand genes in human neurons, including a plethora of autism risk genes, together with RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). MECP2 directly interacts with RNA Pol II, and genes occupied by both proteins showed reduced expression in neurons with MECP2 patient mutations. We conclude that MECP2 acts as a positive cofactor for RNA Pol II gene expression at many neuronal genes that harbor CpG islands in promoter-proximal regions and that RTT is due, in part, to the loss of gene activity of these genes in neurons.", "Keywords": ["MECP2", "RNA polymerase II", "Rett syndrome", "chromatin binding", "transcriptional regulation"], "MeSH terms": ["RNA Polymerase II", "Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2", "Humans", "Neurons", "Transcription, Genetic", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Rett Syndrome", "CpG Islands", "Mutation", "Gene Expression Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Flamier", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "George W", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette Jun", "Last Name": "Diao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Troy W", "Last Name": "Whitfield", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hao-Che", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yizhe", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabian", "Last Name": "Schulte", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Max", "Last Name": "Friesen", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruisi", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maisam", "Last Name": "Mitalipova", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "X Shawn", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seychelle M", "Last Name": "Vos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolf", "Last Name": "Jaenisch", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Here we show that MeCP2 is a dynamic component of heterochromatin condensates in cells, and is stimulated by DNA to form liquid-like condensates. MeCP2 contains several domains that contribute to the formation of condensates, and mutations in MECP2 that lead to Rett syndrome disrupt the ability of MeCP2 to form condensates. Condensates formed by MeCP2 selectively incorporate and concentrate heterochromatin cofactors rather than components of euchromatic transcriptionally active condensates.

Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop.

Preclinical studies have suggested a therapeutic benefit of targeting the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is activated throughout the course of PDA progression by expression of Hh ligands in the neoplastic epithelium and paracrine response in the stromal fibroblasts. Clinical trials to test this possibility, however, have yielded disappointing results. To further investigate the role of Hh signaling in the formation of PDA and its precursor lesion, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), we examined the effects of genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Hh pathway activity in three distinct genetically engineered mouse models and found that Hh pathway inhibition accelerates rather than delays progression of oncogenic Kras-driven disease. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of Hh pathway activity affected the balance between epithelial and stromal elements, suppressing stromal desmoplasia but also causing accelerated growth of the PanIN epithelium. In striking contrast, pathway activation using a small molecule agonist caused stromal hyperplasia and reduced epithelial proliferation. These results indicate that stromal response to Hh signaling is protective against PDA and that pharmacologic activation of pathway response can slow tumorigenesis. Our results provide evidence for a restraining role of stroma in PDA progression, suggesting an explanation for the failure of Hh inhibitors in clinical trials and pointing to the possibility of a novel type of therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": ["Sonic hedgehog", "cancer therapy", "cerulein", "hedgehog agonist", "tumor stroma"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine,Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Rushika M", "Last Name": "Perera", "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114;"}, {"First Name": "Huaijun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Molecular Imaging Program, Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305;"}, {"First Name": "Dai-Chen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine."}, {"First Name": "X Shawn", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Shiwei", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Edwin L.

Previous studies identified Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as the mediator of gemcitabine resistance, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we show that Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2 and Hbo1 mediates the resistance to gemcitabine. We show that the level of Plk1 expression positively correlates with gemcitabine resistance, both in pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Overexpression of Plk1 increases gemcitabine resistance, while inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment. To validate our findings, we show that inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes tumors to gemcitabine treatment in a mouse xenograft study. Mechanistically, we find that Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2 maintains DNA replication on gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, Plk1 phosphorylation of Hbo1 transcriptionally increases cFos expression and consequently elevates its target multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), which was previously reported to confer chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Knockdown of cFos or MDR1 sensitizes gemcitabine-resistant cells to gemcitabine treatment. Finally, pancreatic cancer cells expressing Plk1-unphosphorylatable mutants of Orc2 or Hbo1 are more sensitive to gemcitabine than cells expressing wild-type Orc2 or Hbo1. In short, our study provides a mechanism for Plk1-mediated gemcitabine resistance, suggesting that Plk1 is a promising target for treatment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA Replication", "Deoxycytidine", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Female", "Histone Acetyltransferases", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Origin Recognition Complex", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos", "Pteridines", "Tissue Array Analysis", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "Gemcitabine", "Polo-Like Kinase 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA."}, {"First Name": "X Shawn", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Rice", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shihuan", "Last Name": "Kuang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bennett D", "Last Name": "Elzey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen F", "Last Name": "Konieczny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy L", "Last Name": "Ratliff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tony", "Last Name": "Hazbun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elena G", "Last Name": "Chiorean", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
