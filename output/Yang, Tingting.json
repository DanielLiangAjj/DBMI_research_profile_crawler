Among them, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with layered oxide as the cathode exhibit competitive advantages due to their comprehensive electrochemical performance. However, to meet the requirements of rapid-charging and slow-discharging scenarios, it is necessary to further enhance the rate performance of the cathode material to achieve symmetrical capacity at different rates. Simultaneously, minimizing lattice strain during asymmetric electrochemical processes is also significant in alleviating strain accumulation. In this study, the ordered distribution of transition metal layers and the diffusion pathway of sodium ions are optimized through targeted K-doping of sodium layers, leading to a reduction of the diffusion barrier and endowment of prominent rate performance. At a 20C rate, the capacity of the cathode can reach 94% of that at a 0.1C rate. Additionally, the rivet effect of the sodium layers resulted in a global volume strain of only 0.03% for the modified cathode during charging at a 10C rate and discharging at a 1C rate. In summary, high-performance SIBs, with promising prospects for rapid-charging and slow-discharging capability, are obtained through the regulation of sodium layers, opening up new avenues for commercial applications.", "Keywords": ["layered cathode", "rapid\u2010charging and slow\u2010discharging capability", "ultralow strain"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maolin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Materials, Peking University, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, P.

Thus, nanopore sequencing is promising in in-field forensic applications. Previous investigations have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing is feasible for genotyping forensic short tandem repeats (STRs) by using sequencers of Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Recently, Qitan Technology launched a new portable nanopore sequencer and became the second supplier in the world. Here, for the first time, we assess the QNome (QNome-3841) for its accuracy in nanopore sequencing of STRs and compare with MinION (MinION Mk1B). We profile 54 STRs of 21 unrelated individuals and 2800M standard DNA. The overall accuracy for diploid STRs and haploid STRs were 53.5% (378 of 706) and 82.7% (134 of 162), respectively, by using QNome. The accuracies were remarkably lower than those of MinION (diploid STRs, 84.5%; haploid, 90.7%), with a similar amount of sequencing data and identical bioinformatics analysis. Although it was not reliable for diploid STRs typing by using QNome, the haploid STRs were consistently correctly typed. The majority of errors (58.8%) in QNome-based STR typing were one-repeat deviations of repeat units in the error from true allele, related with homopolymers in repeats of STRs.", "Keywords": ["ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit", "MinION", "QNome", "forensic STR profiling", "nanopore sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Forensic Medicine, Shanxi Medical University, Jinzhong, P.

The results of this study revealed a prevalent dynamic of E11 circulation, with D5 being the predominant genotype worldwide. Further phylogenetic analysis of genotype D5 indicated that it could be subdivided into three important geographic clusters (D5-CHN1: 2014-2019, D5-CHN2: 2016-2022, and D5-EUR: 2022-2023). Additionally, variant-specific (144) amino acid mutation sites and positive-selection pressure sites (132, 262) were identified in the VP1 region.

"Abstract": "Previous research has independently investigated the impact of individual personality traits and object valence on different patterns of attentional selection. However, the interactive role of individual personality traits and object valence in different patterns of attentional selection in both same and different emotional contexts remains unclear. To address the above issues, the present research used a variant of the two-rectangle paradigm, preselected individuals as introverts and extroverts, and simultaneously presented two faces with same or different emotions. Accordance to the result, in the same emotional context, personality traits and object valence did not interact to modulate both space-based effect (SBE) and object-based effect (OBE). However, in the different emotional context, personality traits and object valence interacted to modulate OBE.

It included cognitive training (mnemonic strategy training) and lifestyle guidance (diet, sleep, and exercise guidance) for 7 weeks. A total of 123 Chinese community-dwelling older adults experiencing MCI or SCD were randomly divided into a multicomponent intervention group (n = 62) and a health education group (n = 61). The global cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The cognitive domains outcomes included memory functions measured using the immediate and delayed tests of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and Logical Memory Test (LMT), and executive function and attention measured using the Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Digit Span Test (DST). Data were collected at baseline and postintervention. Results: For cognitive outcome, the results of linear mixed-effect model showed significant time \u00d7 group effects in the MMSE (Cohen d =0.63 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.00], F = 10.25, P = .002).

Comparative analyses of P variations among 13 semi-connected sub-lakes in Wuliangsu Lake in China, a typical MDE lake, considered external flow and macrophyte decomposition as driving forces. Sediment P fractions and water total phosphorus (TP) were analyzed at 35 sampling points across three ice-on season stages, along with macrophyte TP content to assess debris contributions. Our findings reveal that phosphorus accumulation occurs during the ice-on season in the MDE lake, with an average TP content increase of 16\u00a0mg/kg. However, we observed a surprisingly small sediment nutrient accumulation ratio (\u0394TP/\u0394TN=0.006) compared to macrophyte nutrient levels before decomposition. Further analysis of the dominant species, Potamogeton pectinatus, indicates that a significant portion (55%) of macrophyte phosphorus is released before the ice-on season. This highlights the critical importance of timing macrophyte harvesting to precede the phosphorus leaching process, which has implications for lake management and ecosystem restoration efforts. Additionally, our research demonstrates similar transformations among different sediment fractions as previously reported. Macrophyte debris decomposition likely serves as the primary source of Residual P (Res-P) or TP accumulation. In addition, Ca-bound P (Ca-P) generally showed a decrease, which mainly caused by its transformation to Fe/Al-bound P (Fe/Al-P), Exchange-P (Ex-P), and sometimes to Res-P. However, we emphasize the significant impacts of flow dynamics on Ca-P transport and transformations.

We employed cross-lagged panel models to investigate the temporal relationship between hepatic steatosis (assessed by Fatty Liver Index [FLI] in the main analysis, and by Proton Density Fat Fraction [PDFF] in the validation study) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP/ DBP]). Subsequently, we employed causal mediation models to explore the mediation effect in CVD development, including ischemic heart disease and stroke. The main analysis incorporated repeated measurement data of 5,047 participants from the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) and 5,685 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB). In both cohorts, the path coefficients from FLI to blood pressure were significant and greater than the path from blood pressure to FLI, with \u03b2FLI\u2192SBP\u2009=\u20090.081, P\u2009<\u20090.001 versus \u03b2SBP\u2192FLI\u2009=\u20090.020, P\u2009=\u20090.031; \u03b2FLI\u2192DBP\u2009=\u20090.082, P\u2009<\u20090.001 versus \u03b2DBP\u2192FLI\u2009=\u2009-0.006, P\u2009=\u20090.480 for CEMC, and \u03b2FLI\u2192SBP\u2009=\u20090.057, P\u2009<\u20090.001 versus \u03b2SBP\u2192FLI\u2009=\u2009-0.001, P\u2009=\u20090.727; \u03b2FLI\u2192DBP\u2009=\u20090.061, P\u2009<\u20090.001, versus \u03b2DBP\u2192FLI\u2009=\u2009-0.006, P\u2009=\u20090.263 for UKB. The validation study with 962 UKB participants using PDFF consistently supported these findings. In the mediation analyses encompassing 11,108 UKB participants, SBP and DBP mediated 12.2% and 5.2% of the hepatic steatosis-CVD association, respectively. The proportions were lower for ischemic heart disease (SBP: 6.1%, DBP: non-statistically significant -6.8%), and relatively stronger for stroke (SBP: 19.4%, DBP: 26.1%).

However, current technologies for antibiotic-based novel contaminant identification are still restricted to laboratory sample collection and analysis due to detection methodologies and apparatus limitations. This study developed a time-resolved immunofluorescence-based simultaneous field-based assay for ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enrofloxacin (ENR) that matches test results to geographic locations. The assay helps the public understand the potential levels of antibiotic exposures in their environments and helps them take appropriate action to reduce risk. The assay was developed using smartphones and social software in addition to rapid testing. The method uses a portable, low-cost analytical kit with a smartphone app to build a field-based detection platform for the detection and analysis of ENR and CIP in water and aquatic products. The methodological evaluation was good, with detection limits of 0.4\u00a0ng/mL and 0.5\u00a0ng/g for ENR in water and fish, and quantification limits of 1.2\u00a0ng/mL and 1.4\u00a0ng/g, with recoveries of 89.0\u00a0%-101.0\u00a0% and 78.0\u00a0%-97.0\u00a0%.

These limits were sufficient to prevent the two antibiotics from crossing over during simultaneous detection. The assay was validated using real samples to assess the effectiveness of the assay platform in field deployments, and the results were consistent with those obtained through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) techniques. In addition, the TRFIA assay process requires less time, uses more portable instruments, and is less complex than traditional methods.

The study utilized data from 5476 individuals in the NHANES project to investigate the correlation between combined exposure to environmental EDCs and sleep duration through modeling various exposures. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of vitamin D in the present scenario. Preliminary analyses suggested that vitamin D-deficient individuals generally slept shorter than individuals with normal vitamin D (p < 0.05). Exposure to Mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), triclosan (TRS), and Mono-benzyl phthalate (MZP), either alone or in combination, was associated with reduced sleep duration and a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Individuals with low vitamin D levels exposed to TRS experienced shorter sleep duration than those with normal vitamin D levels (p < 0.05). TRS and MZP were identified as crucial factors in patient outcomes when evaluating mixed exposures (p < 0.05).

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has the potential for long-term tumor elimination. However, pre-HSCT myeloablation and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis agents have toxic effects and could eradicate residual CAR T cells and compromise antitumor effects.

However, the LLOs face challenges related to the instability of their OR\u00a0process due to the weak transition metal (TM)-oxygen bond, leading to oxygen loss and irreversible phase transition that results in severe capacity and voltage decay. Herein, a synergistic electronic regulation strategy of surface and interior structures to enhance oxygen stability is proposed. In the interior of the materials, the local electrons around TM and O atoms may be delocalized by surrounding Mo atoms, facilitating the formation of stronger TM\u2500O bonds at high voltages. Besides, on the surface, the highly reactive O atoms with lone pairs of electrons are passivated by additional TM atoms, which provides a more stable TM\u2500O framework. Hence, this strategy stabilizes the oxygen and hinders TM migration, which enhances the reversibility in structural evolution, leading to increased capacity and voltage retention. This work presents an efficient approach to enhance the performance of LLOs through surface-to-interior electronic structure modulation, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of their redox reaction.", "Keywords": ["delocalized electrons", "electronic modulation", "in situ characterization", "lithium\u2010rich oxide cathodes", "oxygen stability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zijia", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, P.

However, doubts have been raised regarding the clinical utility of the assessment of spermatozoa (sperm) DNA damage. In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential correlation between conventional semen parameters and semen DNA fragmentation (SDF) assessed as sperm DNA damage, in 11,339 semen samples collected between January 2019 and June 2022. We observed significant negative correlations between the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and sperm viability (correlation coefficient [r] = -0.514) as well as progressive sperm motility (r\u2009=\u2009-0.512, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Samples were categorized into three groups according to DFI levels (Groups A, B, and C: \u226415%, 15\u2009<\u2009DFI \u226430%, and >30%, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of semen samples with normal sperm conventional parameters in Groups A, B, and C was 76.7% (4369/5697), 61.4% (2351/3827), and 39.7% (721/1815), respectively.

Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that sperm vitality, progressive sperm motility, normal sperm form, total sperm count, semen volume, age, and some sperm kinematics collectively improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to 0.861, surpassing the predictive value of a single predictor of pathologically damaged sperm DNA.

As one of the most widely expressed chemokine receptors, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been a popular research focus. In most tumors, CXCR4 expression is significantly upregulated. Moreover, integrated nuclide diagnosis and therapy targeting CXCR4 show great potential. [68Ga]Ga-pentixafor, a radioligand targeting CXCR4, exhibits a strong affinity for CXCR4 both in vivo and in vitro. However, [177Lu]Lu-pentixather, the therapeutic companion of [68Ga]Ga-pentixafor, requires significant refinement to mitigate its pronounced hepatic biodistribution. The objective of this study was to synthesize theranostic molecular tracers with superior CXCR4 targeting functions. The Daudi cell line, which highly expressed CXCR4, and the MM.1S cell line, which weakly expressed CXCR4, were used in this study. Based on the pharmacophore cyclo (-d-Tyr-n-me-d-Orn-l-Arg-L-2-NAL-Gly-) (CPCR4) of pentixafor, six tracers were synthesized: [124I]I-1 ([124I]I-CPCR4), [99mTc]Tc-2 ([99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-CPCR4), [124I]I-3 ([124I]I-pentixafor), [18F]AlF-4 ([18F]AlF-NETA-CPCR4), [99mTc]Tc-5 ([99mTc]Tc-MAG3-CPCR4) and [124I]I-6 ([124I]I-pentixafor-Ga) and their radiochemical purities were all higher than 95%. After positron emission tomography (PET)/single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, the [124I]I-6 group exhibited the best target-nontarget ratio. At the same time, comparing the [68Ga]Ga-pentixafor group with the [124I]I-6 group, we found that the [124I]I-6 group had a better target-nontarget ratio and lower uptake in nontarget organs. Therefore, compound 6 was selected for therapeutic radionuclide (131I) labeling, and the tumor-bearing animal models were treated with [131I]I-6. The volume of the tumor site was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group, and no significant side effects were found.

According to current knowledge, the SOC effect, normally dominated by the elemental composition, is the main spin-relaxation causation in MSCs, and thus the molecular structure-induced SOC change is one of the most concerned issues. In theoretical study, molecular isomerism, a most prototype phenomenon, has long been considered to possess little difference on spin transport previously, since elemental compositions of isomers are totally the same. However, here in this study, quite different spin-transport performances are demonstrated in ITIC and its structural isomers BDTIC experimentally, for the first time, though the charge transport and molecular stacking of the two films are very similar. By further experiments of electron-paramagnetic resonance and density-functional-theory calculations, it is revealed that noncovalent-conformational locks (NCLs) formed in BDTIC can lead to enhancement of SOC and thus decrease the spin lifetime. Hence, this study suggests the influences from the structural-isomeric effect must be considered for developing highly efficient spin-transport MSCs, which also provides a reliable theoretical basis for solving the great challenge of quantificational measurement of NCLs in films in the future.", "Keywords": ["molecular spintronics", "noncovalent conformational locks", "spin lifetime", "spin transport", "structural isomeric effect"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nanosystem and Hierarchical Fabrication, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, 100190, P.

However, cases recently have been confirmed in many non-endemic countries outside of Africa. The rapidly increasing number of confirmed mpox cases poses a threat to the international community. In-depth studies of key viral factors are urgently needed, which will inform the design of multiple antiviral agents. Mpox virus A41L gene encodes a secreted protein, A41, that is nonessential for viral replication, but could affect the host response to infection via interacting with chemokines. Here, mpox virus A41 protein was expressed in Sf9 cells, and purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that purified A41 binds a certain human chemokine CXCL8 with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) being 1.22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6\u00a0M. The crystal structure of mpox virus A41 protein was solved at 1.92\u00a0\u00c5. Structural analysis and comparison revealed that mpox virus A41 protein adopts a characteristic \u03b2-sheet topology, showing minor differences with that of vaccinia virus.

However, \u03b12A-AR ligands with an imidazole ring also interact with an imidazoline receptor as well as other proteins and lead to undesirable effects, motivating us to develop more novel scaffold \u03b12A-AR ligands. For this purpose, we employed an ensemble-based ligand discovery strategy, integrating long-term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and virtual screening, to identify new potential \u03b12A-AR agonists with novel scaffold. Our results showed that compounds SY-15 and SY-17 exhibited significant biological effects in the preliminary evaluation of protein kinase A (PKA) redistribution assays. They also reduced levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in a dose-dependent manner. Upon treatment of the cells with 100 \u03bcM concentrations of SY-15 and SY-17, there was a respective decrease in the intracellular cAMP levels by 63.43% and 53.83%. Subsequent computational analysis was conducted to elucidate the binding interactions of SY-15 and SY-17 with the \u03b12A-AR. The binding free energies of SY-15 and SY-17 calculated by MD simulations were -45.93 and -71.97 kcal/mol. MD simulations also revealed that both compounds act as bitopic agonists, occupying the orthosteric site and a novel exosite of the receptor simultaneously. Our findings of integrative computational and experimental approaches could offer the potential to enhance ligand affinity and selectivity through dual-site occupancy and provide a novel direction for the rational design of sedatives and analgesics.", "Keywords": ["bitopic agonist", "ensemble-based screening", "molecular dynamics simulation", "\u03b12A-AR"], "MeSH terms": ["Ligands", "Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2", "Analgesics", "Hypnotics and Sedatives"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shiyang", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Strategic Drugs, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengyun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Strategic Drugs, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaqi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongsheng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}, {"First Name": "Peilan", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruibin", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhibing", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Strategic Drugs, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}, {"First Name": "Song", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Strategic Drugs, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}], "Journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Feb29"}, {"PMID": "38466833", "Title": "Early onset of pathological polyploidization and cellular senescence in hepatocytes lacking RAD51 creates a pro-fibrotic and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory microenvironment.", "Abstract": "RAD51 recombinase (RAD51) is a highly conserved DNA repair protein and is indispensable for embryonic viability.

However, therapeutic drugs can interrupt curative effect due to different side effects. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop a novel therapeutic for providing insights for clinical tumor treatment. In this study, we developed a fisetin nanoparticles (Fisetin NPs) through a self-assembled method, and investigated the activity and potential mechanism of Fisetin NPs against lymphoma and leukemia. The spherical and uniformly distributed Fisetin NPs effectively inhibited both tumor cells proliferation, arrested EL4 cells G0/G1 phase and K562 cells G2/M phase, and induced apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, Fisetin NPs exhibited excellent tumor growth inhibition, effective inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, significant induction of apoptosis and ideal safety. Mechanically, fisetin upregulated genes (Fas, Pidd, Puma, Apaf1, and p21) in the p53 signaling pathway and bound to N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), ribosomal protein L34 (RPL34) and GTP binding protein 4 (GTPBP4).

tubulointerstitial inflammation by modulating the tight junctions of renal tubular epithelial cells.", "Abstract": "As one of the most significant pathological changes of diabetic nephropathy (DN), tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) had a close relationship with tubulointerstitial inflammation (TI), and the occurrence of TI could have resulted from the disrupted tight junctions (TJs) of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). Studies have demonstrated that sodium butyrate (NaB), a typical short chain fatty acid (SCFA), played an important regulatory role in intestinal TJs and inflammation. In this study, our in vivo and in vitro results showed that accompanied by TI, renal tubular TJs were gradually disrupted in the process of DN-related TIF. In HG and LPS co-cultured HK-2 cells and db/db mice, NaB treatment regained the TJs of RTECs via the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)/AMPK signaling pathway, relieving inflammation. Small interfering RNA of S1PR1, S1PR1 antagonist W146 and agonist SEW2871, and AMPK agonist AICAR were all used to further confirm the essential role of the S1PR1/AMPK signaling pathway in NaB's TJ protection in RTECs in vitro. Finally, NaB administration not only improved the renal function and TIF, but also relieved the TI of db/db mice. These findings suggested that the use of NaB might be a potential adjuvant treatment strategy for DN-associated TIF, and this protective effect was linked to the TJ modulation of RTECs via the S1PR1/AMPK signaling pathway, leading to the improvement of TI.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Butyric Acid", "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Tight Junctions", "Epithelial Cells", "Fibrosis", "Diabetes Mellitus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Cai", "Last Name": "Heng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, JingJiang People's Hospital, Jingjiang 214500, China."}, {"First Name": "Pian", "Last Name": "Sha", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Yiying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jiaming", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Zhenzhou", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "New drug screening center, Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Sitong", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Chujing", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "New drug screening center, Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Changzhou Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou 213000, China."}, {"First Name": "Xia", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The affiliated hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221006, China."}, {"First Name": "Mengying", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "New drug screening center, Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianyun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxing", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Food & function", "PubDate": "2024Mar04"}, {"PMID": "38353507", "Title": "Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement for functional tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery: A single-center experience.", "Abstract": "Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) following left-sided valve surgery (LSVS) is of clinical significance due to its high recurrence and mortality rates.

Wound-healing assay, Transwell migration assay, and Matrigel invasion assay further showed that AURKA enhanced the ability of EMs cells to migrate and invade. In addition, AURKA was shown to stimulate glycolysis in EMs cells by measuring the concentration of glucose and lactate in the cell supernatants. Moreover, the AURKA inhibitor alisertib was found to inhibit the progression of ovarian EMs and glycolysis in a mouse model of EMs by measuring ectopic tissues as well as by testing the peritoneal fluid of mice. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that AURKA interacted with ER\u03b2. The rescue experiments confirmed that AURKA regulated the development and glycolysis of ovarian EMs in an ER\u03b2-dependent manner.

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed based on the entire VP1 coding region identified 13 genotypes (A-M), revealing a high degree of variation among the EV-C99 strains. Phylogeographic analysis showed that the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is an important source of EV-C99 epidemics in various regions of China. Recombination analysis revealed inter-serotype recombination events of 16 Chinese EV-C99 strains in 5' untranslated regions and 3D regions, resulting in the formation of a single recombination form. Additionally, the Chinese strain of genotype J showed rich aa diversity in the P1 region, indicating that the genotype J of EV-C99 is still going through variable dynamic changes. This study contributes to the global understanding of the EV-C99 genome sequence and holds substantial implications for the surveillance of EV-C99.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian phylodynamics", "EV-C99", "genotyping", "phylogeographic", "recombination"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Enterovirus", "Phylogeny", "Enterovirus Infections", "China", "Genotype", "Genome, Viral"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruyi", "Last Name": "Cong", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinbo", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianjiao", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Huanhuan", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongmei", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuangli", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaolei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongyan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jichen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xizhu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases (NITFID), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of medical virology", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "38297679", "Title": "Polarization state tomography technique based on coherent synthesis of polarization state and orthogonal polarization state separation method for comprehensive optical imaging.", "Abstract": "Comprehensive optical imaging of the intensity, phase, and birefringent information of the biological sample is important because important physical or pathological changes always accompany the changes in multiple optical parameters. Current studies lack such a metric that can present the comprehensive optical property of the sample in one figure. In this paper, a polarization state synthesis tomography (PoST) method, which is based on the principle of polarization state coherent synthesis and demodulation, is proposed to achieve full-field tomographic imaging of the comprehensive information (i.e., intensity, phase, and birefringence) of the biological sample. In this method, the synthesis of the polarization state is achieved by the time-domain full-field low coherence interferometer, where the polarization states of the sample beam and the reference beam are set to be orthogonal for the synthesis of the polarization state. The synthesis of the polarization state enables two functions of the PoST system: (1) Depth information of the sample can be encoded by the synthesized polarization state because only when the optical path length difference between the two arms is within the coherence length, a new polarization state can be synthesized; (2) Since the scattering coefficient, refractive index and the birefringent property of the sample can modulate the intensity and phase of the sample beam, the synthesized polarization state is sensitive to all these three parameters and can provide the comprehensive optical information of the sample. In this work, the depth-resolved ability and the comprehensive optical imaging metric have been demonstrated by the standard samples and the onion cells, demonstrating the potential application value of this method for further investigation of the important physical or pathological process of the biological tissues.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fulong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiayi", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tingfeng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pengfeng", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhuangzhuang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhilie", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peijun", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Optics express", "PubDate": "2024Jan15"}, {"PMID": "38294742", "Title": "Correlation between Anxiety, Depression, and Intestinal Flora in Breast Cancer Patients: Based on 16S rRNA Sequence Analysis.", "Abstract": "To explore intestinal flora differences in species diversity, community structure, and abundance of breast cancer and non-breast cancer populations with anxiety and depression and the corresponding group without anxiety and depression by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunfang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongming", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiuchuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Alternative therapies in health and medicine", "PubDate": "2024Jan01"}, {"PMID": "38286925", "Title": "Spatial infiltration and redistribution of light crude oil in heterogeneous water-bearing soil layers under different hydrogeological processes.", "Abstract": "Two physical models were used to simulate the infiltration and redistribution process of light crude oil after leakage in a heterogeneous soil layer following water level variation and rainfall.

Then, the influencing factors and migration mechanisms were examined. Finally, the soil water and oil contents were measured to verify the simulation results. The results are as follows: (1) the geologic lens and fine-coarse interface can intercept oil, resulting in a local highly contaminated area. (2) The crude oil infiltration path and velocity varied greatly with the different soil types and initial water contents. Within a certain range, the higher the initial water content is, the higher the lateral and vertical infiltration speeds. (3) The oil redistribution process was dominated by vertical infiltration under the condition of water level variation or rainfall, but oil-water displacement and the capillary pressure caused some oil to move horizontally near the geologic lens and fine-coarse interface. (4) Water level variation resulted in a synchronous rise or fall of the oil accumulation area, but rainfall caused it to move up. (5) Water level variation and rainfall imposed a certain influence on the periodic accumulation and release of crude oil in heterogeneous soil, especially in the presence of geologic lenses and lithologic interfaces.", "Keywords": ["Abrupt lithologic interface", "Geologic lens", "Rainfall", "Spatiotemporal distribution", "Water level variation"], "MeSH terms": ["Petroleum", "Soil", "Rain", "Environmental Monitoring", "Water", "Water Movements"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuying", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "School of Fishery, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Fishery, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}, {"First Name": "Senwei", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "School of Fishery, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinsheng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering & Environment, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}, {"First Name": "Yonggang", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Marine Environment and Geological Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China. yonggang@ouc.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Nanning", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Fishery, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Fishery, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China."}], "Journal": "Environmental monitoring and assessment", "PubDate": "2024Jan29"}, {"PMID": "38286850", "Title": "Strain-restricted transfer of ferromagnetic electrodes for constructing reproducibly superior-quality spintronic devices.", "Abstract": "Spintronic device is the fundamental platform for spin-related academic and practical studies.

These issues will eventually confuse the conclusions of academic studies and limit the practical applications of spintronics. Here we propose a polymer-assistant strain-restricted transfer technique that allows perfectly transferring the pre-patterned ferromagnetic electrodes onto channel materials without any damage and change on the properties of magnetism, interface, and channel. This technique is found productive for pursuing superior-quality spintronic devices with high controllability and reproducibility. It can also apply to various-kind (organic, inorganic, organic-inorganic hybrid, or carbon-based) and diverse-morphology (smooth, rough, even discontinuous) channel materials.

Although the prevalence of NAFLD is continuously rising, effective medical treatments are still inadequate. Radix Polygoni Multiflori (RPM) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. As a processed product of RPM, prepared Radix Polygoni Multiflori (PRPM) has been reported to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated whether PRPM treatment could significantly improve NAFLD. We used recent literature, the Herb database and the SwissADME database to isolate the active compounds of PRPM. The OMIM, DisGeNET and GeneCards databases were used to isolate NAFLD-related target genes, and GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. Moreover, PRPM treatment in NAFLD model mice was evaluated. The results indicate that the target genes are mainly enriched in the AMPK and de novo lipogenesis signaling pathways and that PRPM treatment improves NAFLD disease in model mice. Here, we found the potential benefits of PRPM against NAFLD and demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that PRPM and its ingredient emodin downregulate phosphorylated P38/P38, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and genes related to de novo adipogenesis signaling pathways and reduce lipid droplet accumulation.

The procedure is commonly utilized in multiple fields, including neurobiology, immunology, and microbiology, and has emerged as a key focus of life science research. However, a thorough and impartial analysis of the existing state and trends of SCS-related research is lacking. The current study aimed to map the development trends of studies on SCS during the years 2010-2022 through bibliometric software. Methods: Pertinent papers on SCS from 2010 to 2022 were obtained using the Web of Science Core Collection. Research categories, nations/institutions, authors/co-cited authors, journals/co-cited journals, co-cited references, and keywords were analyzed using VOSviewer, the R package \"bibliometric\", and CiteSpace. Results: The bibliometric analysis included 9,929 papers published between 2010 and 2022, and showed a consistent increase in the quantity of papers each year. The United States was the source of the highest quantity of articles and citations in this field. The majority of articles were published in the periodical Nature Communications. Butler A was the most frequently quoted author on this topic, and his article \"Integrating single-cell transcriptome data across diverse conditions, technologies, and species\" has received numerous citations to date. The literature and keyword analysis showed that studies involving single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were prominent in this discipline during the study period.

Colchicine (COL) is a first-line and standard drug for treating gout flares. However, its clinical use is limited due to various adverse effects. Besides, COL fails to adequately meet the needs of patients, particularly young patients. In this study, we investigate the therapeutic administration of Lactobacillus paracasei GY-1 (GY-1) to overcome the limitations of COL. Our results demonstrate that GY-1 attenuates COL toxicity in terms of body weight loss, decreased feed intake, mortality, reduced locomotor activity, colon shortening, increased oxidative stress, histological damage, and impaired gut permeability. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that GY-1 enhances the therapeutic effect for gout flares when combined with COL, as evidenced by the reduction in paw swelling, decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Additionally, the absolute quantification of the gut microbiota shows that GY-1 restores the gut microbiota imbalance caused by COL. Furthermore, GY-1 reduces the abundance of 4 Alistipes species and 6 Porphyromonadaceae species, which may be responsible for toxicity alleviation. At the same time, GY-1 increases the abundance of Bacteroides sartorii and Enterococcus sp., which may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing probiotic-based adjuvant therapy or bacteriotherapy for treating gout flares. To our knowledge, GY-1 is the first probiotic that could be used as an alternative synergetic agent with COL for the therapeutic treatment of gout flares.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Gout", "Colchicine", "Lacticaseibacillus paracasei", "Symptom Flare Up", "Gout Suppressants", "Cytokines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiaqi", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Exposomics and Entire Lifecycle Health, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541199, China. zhouyizhuang3@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Exposomics and Entire Lifecycle Health, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541199, China. zhouyizhuang3@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Yizhi", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Exposomics and Entire Lifecycle Health, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541199, China. zhouyizhuang3@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Guangxi University of Science and Technology, Liuzhou, Guangxi 545005, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Exposomics and Entire Lifecycle Health, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541199, China. zhouyizhuang3@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Yizhuang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Exposomics and Entire Lifecycle Health, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi 541199, China. zhouyizhuang3@163.com."}], "Journal": "Food & function", "PubDate": "2024Feb05"}, {"PMID": "38247010", "Title": "Efficacy of topical 0.05% cyclosporine A and 0.1% sodium hyaluronate in post-refractive surgery chronic dry eye patients with ocular pain.", "Abstract": "The management of post-refractive surgery dry eye disease (DED) can be challenging in clinical practice, and patients usually show an incomplete response to traditional artificial tears, especially when it is complicated with ocular pain.

It is, therefore, important to identify areas at high groundwater pollution risk in the Northern Anhui Plain to ensure effective protection of regional water resources. In this study, 60 groundwater samples were collected from the shallow aquifer of the plain and analyzed for nitrate (NO3-) concentrations. In addition, 10 environmental and geological factors including the elevations, distances-to-rivers, slope angles, orientations of slopes, land cover types, topographic wetness index (TWI), geomorphology, lithology, soil types, and precipitation amounts in the study area were selected as input layers. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and random forest (RF) algorithms, combined with the geographic information system (GIS), were performed to generate the groundwater pollution occurrence probability maps. The descriptive statistics showed that the NO3- concentrations in the shallow groundwater ranged from 4.3 to 73.6\u00a0mg/L. Most sampling wells exhibited NO3- concentrations above the threshold of 18.3\u00a0mg/L. The prediction results of the LightGBM and RF algorithms indicated a high groundwater NO3- pollution risk in the southern part of the plain. However, the LightGBM algorithm had a better prediction performance than RF, with a higher Kappa value of 0.84. Moreover, the frequency ratio method revealed that the precipitation amounts contributed to the groundwater NO3- pollution risk in the study area by 38.14%, followed by the elevations, slope angles, TWI, land cover types, and slope aspects, with contributions of 21.4, 13.02, 8.37, 7.44, and 6.51%, respectively.

Compared with pure CoTiO3, the PCTO7 hybrid catalyst with the electronic attraction center CoP3 exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance and good stability. Experimental results show that the hydrogen evolution performance of the PCTO7 hybrid catalyst reaches 56.52 \u03bcmol, which is 78 times higher than that of the single catalyst CoTiO3 (0.72 \u03bcmol). These results demonstrate that the hybrid catalyst with the self-induced electronic attraction center has a higher light absorption capacity, faster charge carrier dynamics and improved photogenerated charge carrier separation and transfer than pure CoTiO3, resulting in excellent redox capability. DFT calculations provide evidence supporting the topological metal properties of CoP3 as the electron sink center. This study provides a feasible approach for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of a pristine catalyst employing a high-temperature phosphatization-induced electron sink center.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, P.R.China. zl-jin@nun.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Huiqin", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Basic Medicine, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China. yaohq@nxmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials and Manufacturing Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, P.R.China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, P.R.China. zl-jin@nun.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, 710021, Shanxi, China. zhupengfei@sust.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Zhiliang", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, P.R.China. zl-jin@nun.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Nanoscale", "PubDate": "2024Feb01"}, {"PMID": "38190027", "Title": "Analysis of Clinical Characteristics and Neuropeptides in Patients with Dry Eye with and without Chronic Ocular Pain after FS-LASIK.", "Abstract": "Chronic ocular pain, particularly prevalent in patients with dry eye disease and post-femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) surgery, presents with unclear clinical characteristics and an undefined pathogenesis.

Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old male patient with relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and concurrent HLH. Whole-exon sequencing revealed germline mutations associated with HLH, including those in critical genes such as CD27 and UNC13D and other germline heterozygous variants (NOTCH2, NOTCH3, IL2RA, TYK2, AGL, CFD, and F13A1). CD107a analyses consistently demonstrated impaired degranulation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Examination of the patient's family pedigree revealed that his father and mother harbored UNC13D and CD27 mutations, respectively; his brother carried the same CD27 heterozygous mutation. However, none of them manifested the disease. Despite the missense mutation of CD27 (c.779C>T; p.Pro260Leu) lacking previous documentation in databases, comprehensive analysis suggested non-pathogenic mutations in the CD27 variant, indicating minimal impact on T- and NK-cell functions. These results ultimately supported the option of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a successful curative therapeutic approach.

However, existing devices still suffer from poor moisture trapping, low surface charge, and inefficient ion separation, resulting in low output power. Moreover, water freezes at low temperatures (<0 \u00b0C), limiting the ionic diode structure to generate electricity in cold environments. In this paper, a moisture-enabled power generator has been designed and fabricated, which assembles a negatively charged ionic hydrogel film and a positively charged anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) film to construct a heterojunction. The hydrogel polymer network is modified with a large number of sulfonate groups that dissociate to provide nanoscale pores with high surface charge to improve the rectification ratio. And the lithium chloride (LiCl) salt with high hydration ability is added to the hydrogel as a moisture-trapping and anti-freezing component. Usually salt ions reduce the Debye length, so that the ion transport is finally not controlled by the electric double layer (EDL) and the rectification fails. Interestingly, due to the natural affinity of the hydrogel polymer network for LiCl, LiCl is locked on the hydrogel side and does not easily enter the AAO pores to change the distribution of EDL within the nanochannel. As a result, the device rectification ratio is almost independent of the amount of LiCl addition, demonstrating an excellent balance of high output power and high freeze resistance. Ultimately, the device exhibits excellent power generation performance in the -20 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C temperature range and 15% to 93% RH humidity range. Typically, under high humidity (93% RH) at room temperature (25 \u00b0C), it provides an open-circuit voltage of 1.25 V and a short-circuit current of 300 \u03bcA cm-2, with an on-load output power of up to 71.35 \u03bcW cm-2. Under medium humidity (50% RH) at low temperature (-20 \u00b0C), it provides an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a short-circuit current of 15 \u03bcA cm-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiahao", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, P.

Various deep learning and computer vision-based methods have recently been applied for assessing blastocyst quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, most previous works utilize classification networks to give a qualitative evaluation. It would be challenging to rank blastocyst quality with the same qualitative result. Thus, this paper proposes a regression network combined with a soft attention mechanism for quantitatively evaluating blastocyst quality. The network outputs a continuous score to represent blastocyst quality precisely rather than some categories. As to the soft attention mechanism, the attention module in the network outputs an activation map (attention map) localizing the regions of interest (ROI, i.e., inner cell mass (ICM)) of microscopic blastocyst images. The generated activation map guides the entire network to predict ICM quality more accurately. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to traditional classification-based networks. Moreover, the visualized activation map makes the proposed network decision more reliable.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Deep Learning", "Blastocyst", "Embryo Implantation", "Fertilization in Vitro"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youcheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guoqing", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nuo", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yingna", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guangping", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Nowadays, polymerase chain reaction- and capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based STR genotyping is the most commonly used method to distinguish alleles based on their length. However, it could not detect alleles of the same size with sequence differences. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) can determine not only allele sizes but also sequences, which could explain the causes of allele mismatches. Additionally, more types of genetic markers can be detected in a single assay, which increases the discriminatory power and facilitates the analysis of paternity tests. In this study, we analyzed 11 cases with homozygous allele mismatches from routine DNA trio paternity tests using the CE platform. Samples were sequenced using the ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit and the MiSeq FGx Sequencing System. The results show that of the eight father-child mismatch cases and three mother-child mismatch cases, five cases with D5S818 and D8S1179 and one case at D13S317 were classified as non-amplification. The other three cases and two cases could be defined as mutations.

Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.", "Abstract": "The growing global apprehension towards multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria necessitates the development of innovative strategies to combat these infections. Berberine (BER), an isoquinoline quaternary alkaloid derived from various medicinal plants, has surfaced as a promising antibiotic adjuvant due to its ability to enhance the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics against drug-resistant bacterial strains. Here, we overview the augmenting properties and mechanisms of BER as an adjunctive antibiotic against MDR bacteria. BER has been observed to exhibit synergistic effects when co-administered with a range of antibiotics, including \u03b2-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides and fusidic acid. The adjunctive properties of BER led to an increase in antimicrobial effectiveness for these antibiotics against the corresponding bacteria, a decrease in minimal inhibitory concentrations, and even the reversal from resistance to susceptibility sometimes.

Recent cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human bestrophin 1 chloride channel (hBest1) provide an opportunity to evaluate ion interactions predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations against experimental observations. We implement the fully polarizable forcefield AMOEBA in MD simulations of open and partially-open states of the hBest1. The AMOEBA forcefield models multipole moments up to the quadrupole; therefore, it captures induced dipole and anion-\u03c0 interactions. By including polarization we demonstrate the key role that aromatic residues play in ion permeation and the functional advantages of pore asymmetry within the highly conserved hydrophobic neck of the pore. We establish that these only arise when electronic polarization is included in the molecular models. We also show that Cl\u207b permeation in this region can be achieved through hydrophobic solvation concomitant with partial ion dehydration, which is compensated for by the formation of contacts with the edge of the phenylalanine ring. Furthermore, we demonstrate how polarizable simulations can help determine the identity of ion-like densities within high-resolution cryo-EM structures. Crucially, neglecting polarization in simulation of these systems results in the localization of Cl\u207b at positions that do not correspond with their experimentally resolved location. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of including electronic polarization in realistic and physically accurate models of biological systems.", "Keywords": ["Bestrophin channels", "Molecular dynamics", "anion permeation", "anion-\u03c0", "chloride selectivity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linda X", "Last Name": "Phan", "Affiliation": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Aaron P", "Last Name": "Owji", "Affiliation": "Department of Opthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Opthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Crain", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mark S P", "Last Name": "Sansom", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Tucker", "Affiliation": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Nov14"}, {"PMID": "38013171", "Title": "[Biomanufacturing of bioactive compounds: current situation, challenges, and future perspectives].", "Abstract": "Biomanufacturing uses biological systems, including cells, microorganisms, and enzymes, to produce natural or synthetic molecules with biological activities for use in various industries, such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agriculture.

While animal studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) on sperm quality, investigations based on human data are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 1991 sperm donor candidates and employed multivariate linear regression and restricted cubic spline models to quantify the association between outdoor ALAN and sperm quality. The aim was to determine whether there exists an association between exposure to outdoor ALAN and sperm quality. The study included 1991 sperm donor candidates with the following characteristics: mean [SD] age, 24.98 [4.78] years; mean [SD] BMI, 22.13 [2.60] kg/m2; mean [SD] sleep duration, 7.66 [1.07] hours/day. Outdoor ALAN exposure of study participants ranged from 0 to 100\u00a0nW/cm2/sr. Multiple regression analysis on chronic exposure (0-90 days before sperm donation) and human sperm quality revealed the following associations: for CASA primary motion parameters, every 100-unit (nW/cm2/sr) increase in chronic outdoor ALAN was associated with a change of -0.043 [95%CI: 0.073, -0.014] in Linearity (LIN), and -5.523 [95%CI: 9.100, -1.946] in Curvilinear velocity (VCL). For CASA secondary motion parameters, every 100-unit (nW/cm2/sr) increase in chronic outdoor ALAN was associated with a change of -3.873 [95%CI: 4.926, -2.748] in non-progressive motility rate (NP). Furthermore, the primary sperm quality parameter exhibited a decline of -4.740 [95%CI: 8.853, -0.628] in sperm motility rate per 100-unit (nW/cm2/sr) increase in chronic outdoor ALAN. Similar associations were also observed for acute exposure (0-9 days before sperm donation).

BA circulation disorders is one of the characteristic clinical manifestations of cholestasis, and have a closely relationship with intestinal barrier function, especially ileum. Here, our in vivo and in vitro studies showed that intestinal tight junctions (TJs) were disrupted by \u03b1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), which also down-regulated the protein expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) in the top of villus of mice ileum. Activating S1PR1 by specific agonist SEW2871 could improve TJs via inhibiting ERK1/2/LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in the ileum of ANIT-treated mice and ANIT-cultured Caco-2 cells. SEW2871 not only regained ileum TJs by activating S1PR1 in the epithelial cells of ileum mucosa, but also recovered ileum barrier function, which was further verified by the recovered BA homeostasis in mice ileum (content and tissue) by using of high-performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, the improved intestinal injury and inflammation further strengthened that SEW2871 modulated intestinal barrier function in ANIT-treated mice. Finally, our data revealed that along with the down-regulated levels of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), SEW2871 improved liver function and relieved hepatitis via blocking TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB signaling pathway in ANIT-treated mice.

While monopiles have been thoroughly examined, composite foundations that include screw-shaft piles have not been studied as extensively. Proper determination of geometric parameters for both the piles and the cushion is a critical aspect of successful design. This paper introduces a comprehensive examination that merges indoor experiments with numerical simulations, aiming to evaluate the bearing capacity, settlement characteristics, and force characteristics of screw-shaft piles under a variety of conditions. This study scrutinizes key components, such as root diameter, pitch, cushion modulus, and the threaded portion's proportion. The research outcomes offer crucial insights for optimizing the design parameters of screw-shaft pile composite foundations. The results indicate that the side resistance of screw-shaft piles initially increases with the threaded section's length, stabilizing at an optimal length of approximately 0.44-0.55 times the pile length (L). Furthermore, although decreasing the pitch improves bearing capacity, it also introduces variations in pile material usage, with optimal bearing performance noted at a pitch approximately equal to the diameter (D). Moreover, screw-shaft piles with thread widths ranging between 0.58D and 0.67D show a significant decrease in stress concentrations, approximately 22\u00a0% less than those with a width of 0.5D. By setting the cushion modulus within the 40\u00a0MPa-60\u00a0MPa range, reduced settlement and optimal pile-soil stress ratios were achieved.

Although the association between environmental factors and the morbidity and mortality of individual chronic diseases is well-established, the relationship between environmental inequalities and multimorbidity, as well as the patterns of multimorbidity across different areas and ethnic groups, remains unclear. We first focus on analyzing the differences in environmental exposures and patterns of multimorbidity across diverse areas and ethnic groups. The results show that individuals of Han ethnicity residing in Chongqing and Sichuan are exposure to higher levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. Conversely, Tibetans in Tibet and Yi people in Yunnan face elevated concentrations of O3. Furthermore, the Dong, Miao, Buyi ethnicities in Guizhou and Bai in Yunnan have greater access to green spaces. The key multimorbidity patterns observed in Southwest China are related to metabolic abnormalities combined with digestive system diseases. However, significant differences in multimorbidity patterns exist among different regions and ethnic groups. Further utilizing the logistic regression model, the analysis demonstrates that increased exposure to environmental pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3) is significantly associated with higher odds ratios of multimorbidity. Conversely, a greater presence of green spaces (NDVI 250, NDVI 500, NDVI 1000) significantly reduces the risk of multimorbidity. This large-scale epidemiological study provides some evidence of a significant association between environmental inequalities and multimorbidity. By addressing these environmental inequalities and promoting healthy environments for all, we can work towards reducing the prevalence of multimorbidity and improving overall population health.", "Keywords": ["Air pollution", "Environmental inequality", "Green space", "Multimorbidity", "Risk assessment"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "China", "Air Pollution", "Cohort Studies", "Nitrogen Dioxide", "Multimorbidity", "Air Pollutants", "Environmental Exposure", "Particulate Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qibing", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education & Guizhou Provincial Ecological Food Creation Engineering Research Center & School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingbo", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Lab of Computational Chemistry and Drug Design, State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiong", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, 650500, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Chengdu Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu, 610044, China."}, {"First Name": "Zihao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chongqing, 400042, China."}, {"First Name": "La", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "High Altitude Health Science Research Center of Tibet University, Lhasa, 850013, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziyun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education & Guizhou Provincial Ecological Food Creation Engineering Research Center & School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education & Guizhou Provincial Ecological Food Creation Engineering Research Center & School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"First Name": "Leilei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education & Guizhou Provincial Ecological Food Creation Engineering Research Center & School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"First Name": "Zixiu", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education & Guizhou Provincial Ecological Food Creation Engineering Research Center & School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.

In this paper, based on our previous publicly available leaf dataset, an approach that fuses YOLOv8 and improved DeepLabv3+ is proposed for precise image segmentation of individual leaves. First, the leaf object detection algorithm-based YOLOv8 was introduced to reduce the interference of backgrounds on the second stage leaf segmentation task. Then, an improved DeepLabv3+ leaf segmentation method was proposed to more efficiently capture bar leaves and slender petioles. Densely connected atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DenseASPP) was used to replace the ASPP module, and the strip pooling (SP) strategy was simultaneously inserted, which enabled the backbone network to effectively capture long distance dependencies. The experimental results show that our proposed method, which combines YOLOv8 and the improved DeepLabv3+, achieves a 90.8% mean intersection over the union (mIoU) value for leaf segmentation on our public leaf dataset. When compared with the fully convolutional neural network (FCN), lite-reduced atrous spatial pyramid pooling (LR-ASPP), pyramid scene parsing network (PSPnet), U-Net, DeepLabv3, and DeepLabv3+, the proposed method improves the mIoU of leaves by 8.2, 8.4, 3.7, 4.6, 4.4, and 2.5 percentage points, respectively.

Deep Sodiation Process in Layered Sodium Manganese Cathodes by Anchoring Boron Ions.", "Abstract": "Advanced high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are inseparable from cathode materials with high specific capacities. Layered manganese-rich oxides (NaxMnO2, 0.6\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u22641) are promising cathode materials owing to their ease of intercalation and extraction of a considerable amount of sodium ions. However, lattice interactions, especially electrostatic repulsive forces and anisotropic stresses, are usually caused by deep desodiatin/sodiation process, resulting in intragranular cracks and capacity degradation in SIBs. Here, boron ions are introduced into the layered structure to build up B\u2500O\u2500Mn bonds. The regulated electronic structure in Na0.637B0.038MnO2 (B-NMO) materials inhibits the deformation of MnO6 octahedra, which finally achieves a gentle structural transition during the deep sodiation process. B-NMO electrode exhibits a high capacity (141\u00a0mAh\u00a0g-1) at 1\u00a0C with a capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles. Therefore, anchoring boron to manganese-rich materials inhibits the detrimental structural evolution of deep sodiation and can be used to obtain excellent cathode materials for SIBs.", "Keywords": ["anisotropic strain", "deep sodiation", "in situ pair distribution function analysis", "manganese\u2010rich oxides"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, P.

Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. One rotational spectrum was observed for the thiazole-CF4 complex. Experiments and theoretical computations confirmed that the observed structure of thiazole-CF4 is primarily formed due to N\u22efCCF4 interaction with the C atom of CF4 located in the plane of the thiazole ring. The rotational transitions of thiazole-CF4 exhibit A/E torsional splitting induced by the internal rotation of the -CF3 top. The potential barrier of the -CF3 internal rotation is 0.2411(1) kJ mol-1, consistent with the calculated value (\u223c0.3 kJ mol-1). For the thiazole-SF6 complex, one conformer with SF6 located above the thiazole ring is detected. The observed structure of thiazole-SF6 is mainly stabilized by van der Waals interactions. The energy decomposition analysis reveals that the electrostatics and dispersion are the dominant attractive contributions to the formation of thiazole-CF4 and thiazole-SF6 dimers, whereas the weight of the dispersion term becomes more significant in the thiazole-SF6 complex compared to that of the thiazole-CF4 complex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Chongqing University, Daxuecheng South Rd. 55, 401331, Chongqing, China. fengg@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Yugao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Chongqing University, Daxuecheng South Rd. 55, 401331, Chongqing, China. fengg@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Chongqing University, Daxuecheng South Rd. 55, 401331, Chongqing, China. fengg@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Chunmei", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Hongzhiwei Technology (Shanghai) Co.

However, the role of TET2 in solid cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), is unclear. Here, we found that TET2 malfunction in CRC is mostly due to decreased nuclear localization and that nuclear localization of TET2 is correlated with better survival of patients. To explore the underlying mechanisms, 14 immortalized solid tumour cell lines and 12 primary CRC cell lines were used. TET2 was mostly detected in the nucleus, and it induced significant DNA demethylation and suppressed cell growth by demethylating RORA and SPARC in cell lines like SW480. While in cell lines like SW620, TET2 was observed in the cytosol and did not affect DNA methylation or cell growth. Further examination with immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry illustrated that \u03b2-catenin activation was indispensable for the nuclear localization and tumour suppression effects of TET2. In addition, the \u03b2-catenin pathway activator IM12 and the TET2 activator vitamin C were used simultaneously to enhance the effects of TET2 under low-expression conditions, and synergistic inhibitory effects on the growth of cancer were observed both in vitro and in vivo.

fingertip tactile sensing via flexible chromatic optical waveguides.", "Abstract": "Building prosthetics indistinguishable from human limbs to accurately receive and transmit sensory information to users not only promises to radically improve the lives of amputees, but also shows potential in a range of robotic applications. Currently, a mainstream approach is to embed electrical or optical sensors with force/thermal sensing functions on the surface or inside of prosthetic fingers. Compared with electrical sensing technologies, tactile sensors based on stretchable optical waveguides have the advantages of easy fabrication, chemical safety, environmental stability, and compatibility with prosthetic structural materials. However, so far, research has mainly focused on the perception of finger joint motion or external press, and there is still a lack of study on optical sensors with fingertip tactile capabilities (such as texture, hardness, slip detection, etc.). Here we report a 3D printing prosthetic finger with flexible chromatic optical waveguides implanted at the fingertip. The finger achieves distributed displacement/force sensing detection, and exhibits high sensitivity, fast response and good stability. The finger can be used to conduct active sensory experiments, and the detection parameters include object contour, hardness, slip direction and speed, temperature, etc. Finally, exploratory research on identifying and manipulating objects is carried out with this finger. The developed prosthetic finger can artificially recreate touch perception and realize complex functions such as note-writing analysis and braille recognition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Fingers", "Upper Extremity", "Touch", "Touch Perception", "Mechanical Phenomena"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, P.

The results showed that CuO@HA@CNT had lower charge transfer resistance, higher conductivity, lithium-ion diffusion coefficient, specific capacity, and rate capability than CuO@HA and CuO@CNT. The specific capacity of the CuO@HA@CNT electrode was significantly better than that of the composite electrode materials of CuO and CNT, which have been prepared by scientists using various methods. Due to the introduction of HA, not only was the uniformly distributed flower-like CuO obtained, but also the specific capacity and rate capability of the electrode material were substantially improved.

However, the traditional EEG-based emotion recognition is a single feature input mode, which cannot obtain multiple feature information, and cannot meet the requirements of intelligent and high real-time brain computer interface. And because the EEG signal is nonlinear, the traditional methods of time domain or frequency domain are not suitable. In this paper, a CNN-DSC-Bi-LSTM-Attention (CDBA) model based on EEG signals for automatic emotion recognition is presented, which contains three feature-extracted channels. The normalized EEG signals are used as an input, the feature of which is extracted by multi-branching and then concatenated, and each channel feature weight is assigned through the attention mechanism layer. Finally, Softmax was used to classify EEG signals. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CDBA model, experiments were performed on SEED and DREAMER datasets, separately. The validation experimental results show that the proposed CDBA model is effective in classifying EEG emotions. For triple-category (positive, neutral and negative) and four-category (happiness, sadness, fear and neutrality), the classification accuracies were respectively 99.44% and 99.99% on SEED datasets. For five classification (Valence 1-Valence 5) on DREAMER datasets, the accuracy is 84.49%. To further verify and evaluate the model accuracy and credibility, the multi-classification experiments based on ten-fold cross-validation were conducted, the elevation indexes of which are all higher than other models. The results show that the multi-branch feature fusion deep learning model based on attention mechanism has strong fitting and generalization ability and can solve nonlinear modeling problems, so it is an effective emotion recognition method. Therefore, it is helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system diseases, and it is expected to be applied to emotion-based brain computer interface systems.", "Keywords": ["attention mechanism", "bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM)", "convolution neural network (CNN)", "depthwise separable convolution (DSC)", "electroencephalogram (EEG)", "emotion recognition"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhentao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Yahong", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianyun", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliate Children's Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Hangyu", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliate Children's Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Shanshan", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Affiliate Children's Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Baoxi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Weisu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingzhi", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Graduate Student Institute of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, Shanxi Province, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Graduate Student Institute of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, Shanxi Province, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37543016", "Title": "An analyte-replacement near-infrared fluorogenic probe for ultrafast detection of hypochlorite in rheumatoid arthritis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hypochlorous Acid", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Fluorescent Dyes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xue-Liang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China."}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingfei", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, The People's Hospital of Baoan Shenzhen, The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiuwen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, CAS Key Laboratory of Health Informatics, Shenzhen Bioactive Materials Engineering Lab for Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China."}, {"First Name": "Daoyong", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Postdoctoral Innovation Practice Base, Shenzhen Polytechnic, Shenzhen 518055, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, CAS Key Laboratory of Health Informatics, Shenzhen Bioactive Materials Engineering Lab for Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

In the present study, histological analysis of human kidney samples revealed that hypertension induced mtDNA leakage and promoted the expression of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in renal epithelial cells. We used angiotensin II (AngII)- and 2K1C-treated mouse kidneys to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Abnormal renal mtDNA packing caused by AngII promoted STING-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and a fibrogenic response. STING knockout significantly decreased nuclear factor-\u03baB activation and immune cell infiltration, attenuating tubule atrophy and\u00a0extracellular matrix accumulation in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. These effects delayed CKD progression. Immunoprecipitation\u00a0assays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that STING and ACSL4 were directly combined at the D53 and K412 amino acids of ACSL4.

This study primarily aimed to evaluate the clinical severity of DPP4i-associated BP by comparing it to those without Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The secondary objective was to determine whether cessation of DPP4i is necessary for all patients with BP. This retrospective case-control study included 83 patients. The participants were divided into three groups according to their diabetic status and the status of discontinuance or continuance of DPP4i. The 12-month follow-up of the monthly dosage of systemic steroids per body weight (kg) and the percentage of systemic steroid off-therapy in these participants were recorded since the diagnosis of BP. Compared to patients with BP without DM, the 1st, 3rd, and 12th systemic prednisolone doses were significantly lower in the DPP4i group (p\u2009=\u20090.01684, 0.02559, and 0.009336, respectively). The 12th systemic prednisolone dose was significantly lower in patients who discontinued DPP4i (p\u2009=\u20090.0338).

This study systematically summarizes and analyzes the development of KCCs, and classifies the different development stage to identify their development stages and evolutionary process in the Huainan coalfield. The evolution models for KCC development are given, combining with the exploration strata data from boreholes, the groundwater flow data of regional field, the hydrogeochemical data from the relative aquifers of KCC, and the hydrodynamic parameters. The results show that first types of KCCs are discovered in Liuzhuang and the Pansan mine, which is broken and disorganized, with a high degree of filling and cementation, and with the low permeability and velocity, and lower storage capacity. The KCCs in the Xieqiao and Zhangji mine have various morphologies and size differences. Their internal rocks are broken and semi-cemented, with a coefficient of permeability between 0.2 and 0.5\u00a0m/d and a specific discharge between 0.1 and 0.2\u00a0L/s\u2022m. The KCCs are located in the cone of depression and are part of a sink area with moderate water-richness, where upper and lower aquifers have close hydraulic connections with mixed water quality. The internal core of the KCCs in the Gubei Mine is close to the center of the cone of depression which is highly broken and disorganized, with a high permeability, and a specific discharge more than 1.5\u00a0L/s\u2022m. The intensity of runoff increases as its vertical depth also increases, especially the local areas are a higher hydraulic conductivity. Based on comprehensive hydrogeological characteristics, the KCCs development is divided into three stages: growing stage, declining stage, and dead stage. According to their characteristics of different stages, a series of evolutionary processes are established. Combining the sedimentological, karstological, and hydrogeological theories, some measures have been taken for prevention and control of mine water hazard in the various developmental stages. Hence, this research not only provides a new classified approach for KCC stages, but also an essential reference for a better understanding the mechanism of water inrush of KCCs in Northern China.", "Keywords": ["Huainan coalfield", "Hydraulic connections", "Hydrogeochemistry", "Karst collapse column", "Water inrush damage"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environment, Anhui University of Science & Technology, Huainan 232001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Guangquan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environment, Anhui University of Science & Technology, Huainan 232001, PR China.

Recent developments in machine learning provided a viable way for accurate and efficient medical image segmentation for 3D patient-specific models automatically. This study quantitively evaluated the auto segmentation quality and efficiency of the four popular segmentation-dedicated three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including 3D UNet, VNet, 3D Res-UNet and SegResNet. All the CNNs were implemented in PyTorch platform, and low-dose CTA image sets of 98 anonymized patients were retrospectively selected from the database for training and testing of the CNNs. The results showed that despite all four 3D CNNs having similar recall, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and Jaccard index on the segmentation of the aortic root, the Hausdorff distance (HD) of the segmentation results from 3D Res-UNet is 8.56 \u00b1 2.28, which is only 9.8% higher than that of VNet, but 25.5% and 86.4% lower than that of 3D UNet and SegResNet, respectively. In addition, 3D Res-UNet and VNet also performed better in the 3D deviation location of interest analysis focusing on the aortic valve and the bottom of the aortic root. Although 3D Res-UNet and VNet are evenly matched in the aspect of classical segmentation quality evaluation metrics and 3D deviation location of interest analysis, 3D Res-UNet is the most efficient CNN architecture with an average segmentation time of 0.10 \u00b1 0.04 s, which is 91.2%, 95.3% and 64.3% faster than 3D UNet, VNet and SegResNet, respectively.

Hydrogeochemical methods, positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, and Monte Carlo simulation were used to determine the characteristics, sources, and human health risks of inorganic and organic analytes in groundwater. The groundwater was weakly alkaline with high total hardness and was dominated by HCO3-Mg\u00b7Ca, HCO3-Ca\u00b7Mg, and HCO3-Ca\u00b7Mg\u00b7Na hydrochemical facies.

Hydrogeochemical methods revealed that water-rock interactions (including weathering of silicate minerals, dissolution of carbonates, and cation exchange), acidity, and runoff conditions control the migration and enrichment of these analytes in groundwater. The PMF model indicated that local geogenic processes, hydrogeochemical evolution, agricultural activities, and petroleum-related industrial sources were the main factors affecting groundwater quality, with contributions of 38.2\u00a0%, 33.7\u00a0%, 17.8\u00a0%, and 10.3\u00a0%, respectively. A health risk evaluation model based on Monte Carlo simulation indicated that 77.9\u00a0% of children were exposed to a total noncarcinogenic risk above safe thresholds, about 3.4 times higher than the risk to adults.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new method to produce patchoulol efficiently and at low cost. To broaden the production method of patchouli and achieve the heterologous production of patchoulol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the patchoulol synthase(PS) gene from P. cablin was codon optimized and placed under the inducible strong promoter GAL1 to transfer into the yeast platform strain YTT-T5, thereby obtaining strain PS00 with the production of(4.0\u00b10.3) mg\u00b7L~(-1) patchoulol. To improve the conversion rate, this study used protein fusion method to fuse SmFPS gene from Salvia miltiorrhiza with PS gene, leading to increase the yield of patchoulol to(100.9\u00b17.4) mg\u00b7L~(-1) by 25-folds.

However, it was later found that strains of the Beijing family were heterogeneous, and the transmission advantage was restricted to sublineage L2.3 or modern Beijing. In this study, we analyzed the previously published genome sequences of 7,896 L2.3 strains from 51 different countries. Using BEAST software to approximate the temporal emergence of L2.3, our calculations suggest that L2.3 initially emerged in northern East Asia during the early 15th century and subsequently diverged into six phylogenetic clades, identified as L2.3.1 through L2.3.6. Using terminal branch length and genomic clustering as proxies for transmissibility, we found that the six clades displayed distinct population dynamics, with the three recently emerged clades (L2.3.4 to L2.3.6) exhibiting significantly higher transmissibility than the older three clades (L2.3.1 to L2.3.3). Of the Beijing family strains isolated outside East Asia, 83.1% belonged to the clades L2.3.4 to L2.3.6, which were also associated with more cross-border transmission. This work reveals the heterogeneity in sublineage L2.3 and demonstrates that the global success of Beijing family strains is driven by the three recently emerged L2.3 clades. IMPORTANCE The recent population dynamics of the global tuberculosis epidemic are heavily shaped by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains with enhanced transmissibility. The infamous Beijing family strain stands out because it has rapidly spread throughout the world. Identifying the strains responsible for the global expansion and tracing their evolution should help to understand the nature of high transmissibility and develop effective strategies to control transmission. In this study, we found that the L2.3 sublineage diversified into six phylogenetic clades (L2.3.1 to L2.3.6) with various transmission characteristics. Clades L2.3.4 to L2.3.6 exhibited significantly higher transmissibility than clades L2.3.1 to L2.3.3, which helps explain why more than 80% of Beijing family strains collected outside East Asia belong to these three clades. We conclude that the global success of L2.3 was not caused by the entire L2.3 sublineage but rather was due to the rapid expansion of L2.3.4 to L2.3.6. Tracking the transmission of L2.3.4 to L2.3.6 strains can help to formulate targeted TB prevention and control.", "Keywords": ["Beijing family", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "evolution", "genomic epidemiology", "modern Beijing sublineage"], "MeSH terms": ["Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Beijing", "Phylogeny", "Genotype", "Population Dynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chendi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinfeng", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Howard E", "Last Name": "Takiff", "Affiliation": "Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Caracas, Venezuela."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (Ministry of Education/National Health Commission/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qingyun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

NLRP3 has been widely evaluated as a potential target for multiple active agents in treating NAFLD. As a quercetin glycoside, isoquercitrin (IQ) has a broad inhibitory effect on oxidative stress, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and allergic reactions in vitro and in vivo. This study aimed to investigate the undercover mechanism of IQ in the treatment of NAFLD, particularly in anti-steatohepatitis, by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, a methionine-choline-deficient induced steatohepatitis mice model was used to explore the effect of IQ on NAFLD treatment. Further mechanism exploration based on transcriptomics and molecular biology revealed that IQ inhibited the activated NLRP3 inflammasome by down-regulating the expression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and suppressor of G-two allele of Skp1 (SGT1).

Ependyma is a layer of ciliated ependymal cells that participates in the formation of the brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB). It functions to promotes the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the material exchange between CSF and brain interstitial fluid. Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) shows obvious impairments of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the neuroinflammatory processes after acute brain injury, a large amount of complement proteins and infiltrated immune cells are circulated in the CSF to resist brain damage and promote substance exchange through the BCB. However, as the protective barrier lining the brain ventricles, the ependyma is extremely vulnerable to cytotoxic and cytolytic immune responses. When the ependyma is damaged, the integrity of BCB is destroyed, and the CSF flow and material exchange is affected, leading to brain microenvironment imbalance, which plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other neurotrophic factors promote the differentiation and maturation of ependymal cells to maintain the integrity of the ependyma and the activity of ependymal cilia, and may have therapeutic potential in restoring the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment after RIBI or during the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.", "Keywords": ["brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier", "cerebrospinal fluid", "ependyma", "epidermal growth factor (EGF)", "neurodegenerative diseases", "radiation-induced brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Ependyma", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Brain", "Brain Injuries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin-Yu", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China."}, {"First Name": "Lian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Chun", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng-Ru", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Radiation Physiology Laboratory, Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative, National University of Singapore, Singapore 138602, Singapore."}], "Journal": "Biomolecules", "PubDate": "2023Apr27"}, {"PMID": "37233353", "Title": "Antibacterial-Based Hydrogel Coatings and Their Application in the Biomedical Field-A Review.", "Abstract": "Hydrogels exhibit excellent moldability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and extracellular matrix-like properties, which make them widely used in biomedical fields.

As a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) plays an important role not only in regulating the fibrosis process but also in maintaining the mitochondrial function of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. However, it was not clear whether YY1 participated in maintaining mitochondrial function of RTECs in early DN-associated TIF. In this study, we dynamically detected mitochondrial functions and protein expression of YY1 in db/db mice and high glucose (HG)-cultured HK-2 cells. Our results showed that comparing with the occurrence of TIF, the emergence of mitochondrial dysfunction of RTECs was an earlier even, besides the up-regulated and nuclear translocated YY1. Correlation analysis showed YY1 expressions were negatively associated with PGC-1\u03b1 in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism research demonstrated the formation of mTOR-YY1 heterodimer induced by HG up-regulated YY1, the nuclear translocation of which inactivated PGC-1\u03b1 by binding to the PGC-1\u03b1 promoter. Overexpression of YY1 induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in normal glucose-cultured HK-2 cells and 8-weeks-old db/m mice.

Finally, downregulation of YY1 could retard the progression of TIF by preventing mitochondrial functions, resulting in the improvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in early DN.

In this study, four microplastics, including polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA) and polyethylene (PE), were photoaged by UV light in anoxic environment. The surface characteristics of microplastics and adsorption behavior of norfloxacin (NOR) on microplastics were investigated. Results indicated that the specific surface area and crystallinity increased, and hydrophobicity weakened of microplastics after UV aging. The content of C element decreased and the content of O barely changed in the aged microplastics. In addition, the adsorption of NOR on microplastics yielded a better fitness for the pseudo-second-order kinetics, Langmuir and Freundlich models. The adsorption capacities of NOR on PS, PA, PP, and PE at 288\u00a0K were 16.01, 15.12, 14.03, and 13.26\u00a0mg\u00b7g-1, respectively, while the adsorption capacities of NOR on aged microplastics were reduced to 14.20, 14.19, 11.50, and 10.36\u00a0mg\u00b7g-1, respectively, due to decrease of hydrophobicity and increase of crystallinity of microplastics after UV aging. The adsorption of NOR on microplastics decreased with the increase of temperature, implying the adsorption process was exothermic. Adsorption mechanism analysis showed that Van der Waals force was the main influential mechanism of the adsorption of NOR on PP and PE, and hydrogen bond was the main factor affecting the adsorption of NOR on PA, while the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction was the main mechanism impacting the adsorption of NOR on PS. Aging time and salinity significantly affect the adsorption of NOR on microplastics. With the increase of humic acid concentration and pH, the adsorption of NOR on microplastics first reduced and then rose. This study provides a basis for further clarifying the mechanism of UV aging microplastics and a reference for the study of combined pollution behavior of microplastics and antibiotics.", "Keywords":

common clinical feature of many acute and chronic conditions. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA transcripts that are involved in various physiological and pathological processes, but their role in muscle atrophy remains unknown. Global circRNA expression profiling indicated that circRNAs are involved in the pathophysiological processes of muscle atrophy. circTmeff1 is identified as a potential circRNA candidate that influences muscle atrophy. It is further identified that circTmeff1 is highly expressed in multiple types of muscle atrophy in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the overexpression of circTmeff1 triggers muscle atrophy in vitro and in vivo, while the knockdown of circTmeff1 expression rescues muscle atrophy in vitro and in vivo. In particular, the knockdown of circTmeff1 expression partially rescues muscle mass in mice during established atrophic settings. Mechanistically, circTmeff1 directly interacts with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and promotes aggregation of TDP-43 in mitochondria, which triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into cytosol and activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/\u00a0stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Unexpectedly, TMEFF1-339aa is identified as a novel protein encoded by circTmeff1 that mediates its pro-atrophic effects.

The immobilization capacity and mechanism of FM-BC were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization and chemical analysis.

Generally, EV-A71-associated HFMD is a relatively self-limiting febrile disease, but there will still be a small percentage of patients with rapid disease progression and severe neurological complications. To date, the underlying mechanism of EV-A71 inducing pathological injury of central nervous system (CNS) remains largely unclear. It has been investigated and discussed the changes of mRNA, miRNA and circRNA expression profile during infection by EV-A71 in our previous studies. However, these studies were only analyzed at the RNA level, not at the protein level. It's the protein levels that ultimately do the work in the body. Here, to address this, we performed a tandem mass tag (TMT) peptide labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS approach to quantitatively identify cellular proteome changes at 24\u00a0h post-infection (hpi) in EV-A71-infected 16HBE cells. In total, 6615 proteins were identified by using TMT coupled with LC-MS/MS in this study. In the EV-A71- and mock-infected groups, 210 differentially expressed proteins were found, including 86 upregulated and 124 downregulated proteins, at 24 hpi. To ensure the validity and reliability of the proteomics data, 3 randomly selected proteins were verified by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis, and the results were consistent with the TMT results. Subsequently, functional enrichment analysis indicated that the up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were individually involved in various biological processes and signaling pathways, including metabolic process, AMPK signaling pathway, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, Viral myocarditis, GABAergic synapse, and so on. Moreover, among these enriched functional analysis, the \"Proteasome\" pathway was up-regulated, which has caught our attention.

PIM2 can promote the development of tumors, but the mechanism of PIM2 in endometriosis is still unclear. Therefore, our goal is to study the mechanism of PIM2 in endometriosis. Through immunohistochemistry, we found PIM2, HK2, PKM2, SMH (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), Desmin, and \u03b1-SMA (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin) were strongly expressed in the\u00a0ovarian endometriosis. In endometriotic cells, PIM2 enhanced glycolysis and fibrosis via upregulating the expression of PKM2. Moreover, the PIM2 inhibitor SMI-4a inhibited the development of endometriosis.

This paper investigates the DSM extraction method using Gaofen-6 (GF-6) high-resolution (HR) cross-track images with a wide field of view (WFV). To guarantee the elevation accuracy, the relationship between the intersection angle and the overlap of the cross-track images was analyzed. Cross-track images with 20-40% overlaps could be selected to conduct DSM extraction. First, the rational function model (RFM) based on error compensation was used to realize the accurate orientation of the image. Then, the disparity map was generated based on the semi-global block matching (SGBM) algorithm with epipolar constraint. Finally, the DSM was generated by forward intersection. The GF-6 HR cross-track images with about 30% overlap located in Taian, Shandong Province, China, were used for DSM extraction. The results show that the mountainous surface elevation features were retained completely, and the details, such as houses and roads, were presented in valleys and urban areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the extracted DSM could reach 6.303 m, 12.879 m, 14.929 m, and 19.043 m in valley, ridge, urban, and peak areas, respectively.

However, despite great effort, the interfacial effect cannot be precisely controlled to achieve steady and predictable functions, especially at room temperature, and this has gradually become a significant bottleneck in the development of molecular spintronics. In this study, an innovative spin-filtering-competition mechanism is proposed to continuously modulate the interfacial effect in molecular spin valves at room temperature. To form this novel mechanism, the original spin-filtering effect from pure cobalt competes with the newly generated one, which is induced by the bonding effect between cobalt and lithium fluoride. Subsequently, by precisely controlling competition through lithium fluoride coverage on the cobalt surface, continuous modulation of the spin-injection process can be successfully achieved at room temperature. Spin polarization of the injected current and magnetoresistance effect can be actively controlled or their sign can be completely reversed through this novel mechanism. This study provides an innovative approach and theory for precisely controlling spin-related interfacial effects, which may further promote the scientific and technological development of spintronics.", "Keywords": ["molecular semiconductors", "room-temperature", "spin valves", "spin-filtering competition", "spin-injection modulation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shunhua", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanosystem and Hierarchical Fabrication, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, 100190, P.

PSA's mechanism is unclear, and there are few prevention and treatment measures. Our previous study found that HDAC3 could activate NF-\u03baB signaling through mediated p65 deacetylation, which further influenced microglia activation. That implies HDAC3 may be the key mediator in ischemic stroke mice and modulates anxiety susceptibility to stress. This study established a PSA model in male C57BL/6 mice through photothrombotic stroke combined with chronic restrain stress. We focused on exploring whether esketamine administration can alleviate anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation, which may be associated with inhibiting HDAC3 expression and NF-\u03baB pathway activation. The results showed that esketamine administration alleviated anxiety-like behavior in PSA mice. And the results showed that esketamine alleviated cortical microglial activation, altered microglial number, and kept morphology features. Furthermore, the results showed that the expression of HDAC3, phosphor-p65/p65, and COX1 significantly decreased in esketamine-treated PSA mice. Besides, we also found that esketamine reduced PGE2 expression, one of the primary regulators of negative emotions. Interestingly, our results indicate that esketamine reduced the perineuronal net (PNN) number in the pathological process of PSA. In conclusion, this study suggests esketamine could alleviate microglial activation, reduces inflammatory cytokine, and inhibits the expression of HDAC3 and NF-\u03baB in the cortex of PSA mice to attenuate anxiety-like behavior.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and is considerably overexpressed in tumor tissues. This study aimed to develop new human TREM2 (hTREM2)-targeting imaging agents to diagnose and monitor gastric cancer.

Related residential standards define the thresholds of quietness concerning noise pollution problems. However, the variations in height across floors of high-rise buildings and time in sound environments have not been detailed. The city of Shanghai experienced a citywide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 showing the evidence of quietness with marked reductions in anthropogenic noise. Here, we conducted noise monitoring in a 14-story apartment building surrounded and shielded by other buildings in a typical urban community during and after lockdown. The mean value of the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level (L Aeq ) of all 14 floors after lockdown was higher than that during lockdown, and the differences were 3.6 and 3.1 dB during the daytime and night-time periods, respectively. The L Aeq values at low heights were slightly lower than those at high heights during and after lockdown. The variations due to the different heights were not great. However, the change tendency from the ground to the top floors was similar and correlated during and after lockdown. The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the floors was 3 dB during the daytime period and 4.5 to 5.1 dB during the night-time period. The day equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level (L day ) and night equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level (L night ) at the middle building height increased 4.0 and 1.3 dB, respectively, after lockdown. The L Aeq change tendency during a daily cycle during and after lockdown was similar and highly correlated. The differences in the frequency characteristics of noise level were larger within the 63 to 2,000 Hz range. We suggest that the building represents a typical quiet living condition in high-density habitats in China. Notably, the difference is approximately 3 to 4 dB, and the patterns of variation in height and time are similar between the absence and limited presence of anthropogenic noise.

Herein, a metal phosphide nanoarray (NiMo-Fe-P) electrocatalyst was designed by in situ ion exchange and low-temperature phosphating to promote overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. NiMo-Fe-P demonstrates superb HER and OER activities as reflected by the low overpotentials of 73.1 mV and 215.2 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The addition of Fe changes the electronic structure of Ni, which is conducive to the chemisorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and reduces the energy barrier for water decomposition. Besides, the metal phosphide not only acts as the active site of the HER, but also improves the conductivity of the catalyst. Furthermore, nanowire arrays and the small particles generated on their surfaces provide a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), which was beneficial for the exposure of active sites.

Microbiota transplantation has long been thought to reverse the behavioral changes in the brain caused by colony dysregulation, but in our study, microbiota transplantation seemed to improve only behavioral brain function, and there was no reasonable explanation for the high level of hippocampal neuron apoptosis that remained. Butyric acid is one of the short-chain fatty acids of intestinal metabolites and is mainly used as an edible flavoring. It is commonly used in butter, cheese and fruit flavorings, and is a natural product of bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and resistant starch in the colon, acting similarly to the small-molecule HDAC inhibitor TSA. The effect of butyric acid on HDAC levels in hippocampal neurons in the brain remains unclear. Therefore, this study used rats with low bacterial abundance, conditional knockout mice, microbiota transplantation, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and behavioral assays to demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of short-chain fatty acids on the acetylation of hippocampal histones. The results showed that disturbance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism led to high HDAC4 expression in the hippocampus and regulated H4K8ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac to promote increased neuronal apoptosis. However, microbiota transplantation did not change the pattern of low butyric acid expression, resulting in maintained high HDAC4 expression in hippocampal neurons with continued neuronal apoptosis. Overall, our study shows that low levels of butyric acid in vivo can promote HDAC4 expression through the gut-brain axis pathway, leading to hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and demonstrates that butyric acid has great potential value for neuroprotection in the brain. In this regard, we suggest that patients with chronic dysbiosis should pay attention to changes in the levels of SCFAs in their bodies, and if deficiencies occur, they should be promptly supplemented through diet and other means to avoid affecting brain health.", "Keywords": ["HDAC4", "Histone acetylation", "Intestine-brain axis", "Neuronal apoptosis", "Short-chain fatty acids"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Rats", "Animals", "Butyric Acid", "Dysbiosis", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Fatty Acids, Volatile", "Bacteria", "Hippocampus", "Apoptosis", "Histone Deacetylases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yongjie", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, the key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China; Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; Department of Medical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Sijia", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Liying", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; Department of Medical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Changyudong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shuang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yiqiong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yunfeng", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Guizhou Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China; School of Clinical Laboratory Science, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China.

The numbers of NeuN+ GFAP+ EdU+ cells (intermediates) and NeuN+ EdU+ cells (end products) were determined by immunofluorescence to explore the regional preference of transdifferentiation. In addition, to optimize the delivery of the transdifferentiation medium, three key growth factors, insulin, bFGF and transferrin, were loaded onto chitosan nanoparticles, mixed with gelatin methacryloyl and tested in animals with motor cortex injury. A higher transdifferentiation efficiency was identified in the mouse cortex. Differences in cellular respiration and the balance between glutaminase (Gls) and glutamine synthetase were confirmed to be key regulators. In addition, the sustained drug release system induced transdifferentiation of cortex astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro, and partially facilitated the behaviour recovery of mice with motor cortex injury. We also applied this method in pigs and obtained consistent results.

Recently, the fluorescence probe of H2S based on organic dye has attracted great attention. However, the emission of many probes is in the UV-vis region (400-600\u00a0nm), so it has the disadvantages of shallow tissue penetration and more vulnerable to spontaneous fluorescence interference. Although several H2S probes have been developed that emit more than 650\u00a0nm, there is a complex structure difficult to synthesize or unstable in storage. Aimed at simply structural and easily synthesized H2S fluorescent probes with emission wavelength more than 650\u00a0nm, a novel near-infrared (NIR) probe (NIR-H2S) here was rationally designed with 4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-7-(diethylamino)-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)chromenylium (NIR-OH) as a fluorescent dye and 2,4-dinitrophenyl moiety as a recognition group. Addition of H2S, the \"turn-on\" NIR fluorescence response at 736\u00a0nm of NIR-H2S was displayed, accompanied by a visual colour change from purple to green when excited at 686\u00a0nm.

Previous studies have shown that macrophages can express different phenotypes, among which M2 polarization is important to maintain the balance of the inflammatory microenvironment and promote cartilage regeneration. In this study, 4-octyl itaconic acid (4-OI), a derivative of the endogenous metabolite itaconic acid, was used to regulate the polarization behavior of macrophages and enhance cartilage repair. Oxidized sodium alginate (OSA) and gelatin (GEL) were selected as materials to form injectable hydrogels with the function of sustained release of 4-OI. In vivo and in vitro experiments have verified that the OSA/GEL hydrogel system loaded with 4-OI could promote M2 macrophage polarization and inhibit the inflammatory reaction. A rat knee joint cartilage defect model further confirmed its role in promoting cartilage regeneration in the later stage. In this study, the OSA/GEL hydrogel was successfully fabricated as a vehicle for delivering 4-OI, which could evidently alleviate the inflammatory reaction and thus accelerate tissue regeneration.

This study aims to reveal the pharmacological effects of kaempferol, which is the active component of Radix Bupleuri and Tripterygii Radix, and potential mechanisms for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we employed the bioinformatics methods to filter the anti-COVID-19 candidate genes of kaempferol, which mainly enriched in inflammation (TNF, JUN, etc.) and virus infection (AKT1, JNK, etc.). The Transcription levels of AKT1, JNK and JUN were significantly reduced by kaempferol treatment in the LPS-activated macrophages. In addition, kaempferol reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors by LPS-stimulated macrophages, inhibited MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling and regulated macrophage polarization to M2 type in vitro, and suppressed endotoxin-induced cytokine storm and improved survival in mice. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that kaempferol was probable to bind the COVID-19 protein 5R84 and formatted hydrogen bond with the residues, the free binding energy of which was lower than the original ligand.

After the labeling and image pre-processing, a training set and test set containing 112 and 28 IA lesions were used to train and evaluate the convolutional neural network mentioned above. The performances of three convolutional neural networks were compared in terms of training performance, segmentation performance, and segmentation efficiency using multiple quantitative metrics. All the convolutional neural networks showed a non-zero voxel-wise recall (V-Recall) at the case level. Among them, 3D UNet exhibited a better overall segmentation performance under the relatively small sample size. The automatic segmentation results based on 3D UNet reached an average V-Recall of 0.797 \u00b1 0.140 (3.5% and 17.3% higher than that of VNet and 3D Res-UNet), as well as an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.818 \u00b1 0.100, which was 4.1%, and 11.7% higher than VNet and 3D Res-UNet. Moreover, the average Hausdorff distance (HD) of the 3D UNet was 3.323 \u00b1 3.212 voxels, which was 8.3% and 17.3% lower than that of VNet and 3D Res-UNet. The three-dimensional deviation analysis results also showed that the segmentations of 3D UNet had the smallest deviation with a max distance of +1.4760/-2.3854\u00a0mm, an average distance of 0.3480\u00a0mm, a standard deviation (STD) of 0.5978\u00a0mm, a root mean square (RMS) of 0.7269\u00a0mm. In addition, the average segmentation time (AST) of the 3D UNet was 0.053s, equal to that of 3D Res-UNet and 8.62% shorter than VNet. The results from this study suggested that the proposed deep learning framework integrated with 3D UNet can provide fast and accurate IA identification and segmentation.", "Keywords": ["SAH", "automatic segmentation", "convolutional neural network", "deep learning", "intracranial aneurysm"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guangyu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueqi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Xi'an Key Laboratory of Scientific Computation and Applied Statistics, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Joon Hock", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Ge", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36576282", "Title": "The effect of nutritional status on clinical outcome in lung transplantation.", "Abstract": "Nutritional status greatly impacts the clinical outcome of the patients receiving lung transplantation.

However, limited studies explored the effects and potential epigenetic mechanisms of maternal PM2.5 exposure on offspring spatial memory defects. This study aims to explore the effects and underlying epigenetic mechanisms of maternal concentrated ambient PM2.5 exposure in male mice offspring with spatial memory defects. Pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed daily to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (CAP) or filtered air (FA) throughout gestation, with the concentration of particulates (102.99\u2009\u00b1\u200978.74\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) and (2.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.19\u00a0\u03bcg/m3), respectively. Adult male mice offspring were subsequently assessed for spatial learning and memory ability using Morris Water Maze tests and locomotor activities in open field tests. The hippocampus of the male mice offspring was harvested to test mRNA expression and DNA methylation. Results from the probe test of Morris Water Maze showed that the mice offspring in the CAP group had shorter swimming distance travelled in the target quadrant, shorter\u00a0duration in the target quadrant, and\u00a0less number of entries into the target quadrant (p\u2009<\u20090.05), suggesting spatial memory impairments.

A nationwide large-scale study on mcr prevalence and transmission in nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates is still lacking. Here, we identified 140 mcr-positive Salmonella isolates out of 7,106 isolates from 29 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020. We aligned short reads to putative plasmids from long-read hybrid assemblies and predicted the plasmid backbones of non-long-read sequencing isolates to elucidate mcr transmission patterns. The mcr-1 and mcr-3 genes are transmitted on similar high-risk clones (sequence type 34 [ST34]) but through plasmids of various replicon types. Furthermore, the ban on colistin use in food animals can lead to a decrease in the mcr-positive Salmonella prevalence among diarrheal patients, related mainly to IncHI2A_IncHI2 plasmids. We provide a framework for plasmid data incorporation into genomic surveillance systems, contributing to a better understanding of mcr spread and transmission. IMPORTANCE Nontyphoidal Salmonella is one of four major causative agents of diarrheal diseases globally, with most cases of salmonellosis being mild. Antimicrobial treatments are required for cases of life-threatening infections, and colistin is one of the last-line antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections. However, the efficacy of colistin has been compromised by the emergence of various mcr genes. To elucidate the transmission of mcr genes in Salmonella isolates, our study analyzed 7,106 Salmonella strains from 29 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020. The results showed that mcr genes are transmitted on similar high-risk clones (ST34) but through plasmids of various replicon types. In addition, our data illustrated that the ban on the use of colistin in food animals led to a significant decrease in mcr-positive isolates.

Mounting evidence supports their activation in the brain during epilepsy, and inhibition of the P2X7 receptor reduces the seizure frequency and severity. In this study, we investigate P2X7R-targeted (18F-FTTM) position emission tomography (PET) imaging in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy to obtain further insights into the role of P2X7R during epileptogenesis. 18F-FTTM (5-10% radiochemical yield, over 99% radiochemical purity, and a specific activity of 270-300 MBq/nmol, n = 6, EOS) was first synthesized. Then, the rat models induced by intrahippocampal injection of saline (1.2 \u03bcL, n = 15) or kainic acid (1.2 \u03bcL, 0.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, n = 35) were examined using 18F-FTTM Micro-PET/CT longitudinal imaging, respectively. The imaging results showed that increases in the 18F-FTTM uptake was evident after status epilepticus (SE) in the epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, or temporal cortex, and this peaked during the latent period. The histopathological analysis revealed that the P2X7R PET uptake reached a peak at 7 days after SE and was mostly related to microglial activation. Thus, P2X7R-targeted PET imaging agent 18F-FTTM may act as a useful tool for identifying brain inflammation during epilepsy. P2X7R PET is a highly potent longitudinal biomarker of epilepsy and could be of interest to determine the therapeutic windows in epilepsy and to monitor treatment response, and it warrants further clinical studies.", "Keywords": ["P2X7 receptor", "kainic acid", "neuroinflammation imaging", "positron emission tomography", "temporal lobe epilepsy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Rats", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Kainic Acid", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X7", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Encephalitis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhequan", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Qingyu", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Dai", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Guobing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongcheng", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Dengfeng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022Dec07"}, {"PMID": "36373648", "Title": "Intermolecular amide and aldehyde interactions: rotational spectroscopy of the complexes of formaldehyde with 2-azetidinone and formamide.", "Abstract": "The binary intermolecular complexes of amides and formaldehyde can be taken as suitable models to investigate the non-covalent interactions of a peptide with the carbonyl group.

Early detection and timely intervention are vital for reducing the risk of visual impairment caused by RH. However, little is known about the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of RH in southern China. Full-term infants born in Qingyuan City during the first 10 days of each month in 2021 were included in this study. All infants underwent RetCam III retinal examinations. Detailed information on retinal hemorrhage, including involved eyes, bleeding severity, and affected area (extrafoveal macula, fovea, or optic disc), and clinical information on the neonates and their mothers was collected. The results showed that among the 1072 eligible neonates, 266 (24.8%) had neonatal retinal hemorrhage. Consistent bilateral retinal hemorrhage severity was observed in 83.2% of the cases. The prevalence of optic disc involved RH, extrafoveal macular involved RH and foveal involved RH were 23.7%, 81.2% and 2.63%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower birth weight (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.99; p < 0.05) and vaginal delivery (OR, 20.6; 95% CI, 9.10-46.5; p < 0.001) were risk factors of neonatal RH.

A strong relation between fluoride exposure and obesity has been reported. However, the potential mechanisms on fluoride-induced obesity remain unexplored. Objectives and methods The effects of fluoride on the obesity were investigated using mice model. Furthermore, the role of gut homeostasis in exacerbation of the obesity induced by fluoride was evaluated. Results The results showed that fluoride alone did not induce obesity in normal diet (ND) fed mice, whereas, it could trigger exacerbation of obesity in high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Fluoride impaired intestinal barrier and activated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling to induce obesity, which was further verified in TLR4-/- mice. Furthermore, fluoride could deteriorate the gut microbiota in HFD mice. The fecal microbiota transplantation from fluoride-induced mice was sufficient to induce obesity, while the exacerbation of obesity by fluoride was blocked upon gut microbiota depletion. The fluoride-induced bloom of Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum was responsible for exacerbation of obesity. In addition, a potential strategy for prevention of fluoride-induced obesity was proposed by intervention with polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea. Conclusion Overall, these results provide the first evidence of a comprehensive cross-talk mechanism between fluoride and obesity in HFD fed mice, which is mediated by gut microbiota and intestinal barrier.

However, the influence of VEN-based therapy on the prognosis of subsequent allogeneic HSCT remains unknown. We retrospectively collected data from patients who proceeded to allo-HSCT between November 2018 and November 2020 after VEN-based therapy at five transplant centers in Zhejiang Province, China. A total of 39 patients were analyzed. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with AML (28 de novo, 3 secondary to MDS), 6 with MDS, and 2 with CMML. The majority (74.4%) of patients received VEN-based therapy for the treatment of relapse (38.5%) or refractory disease (35.9%); 5 (12.8%) received it as an initial treatment, and 5 (12.8%) patients who were already in complete remission (CR) received VEN for further consolidation or deep remission before HSCT. Twenty-seven (69.2%) patients were in CR at the time of HSCT.

Here we uncover a directional permeability of BEST2 to glutamate that heavily favours glutamate exit, identify glutamine synthetase (GS) as a binding partner of BEST2 in the ciliary body of the eye, and solve the structure of the BEST2-GS complex. BEST2 reduces cytosolic GS activity by tethering GS to the cell membrane. GS extends the ion conducting pathway of BEST2 through its central cavity and inhibits BEST2 channel function in the absence of intracellular glutamate, but sensitizes BEST2 to intracellular glutamate, which promotes the opening of BEST2 and thus relieves the inhibitory effect of GS.

Based on the baseline survey data of the Chinese Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study, 10,620 subjects were included in the study. Logistic regression analysis evaluated the relationship between urinary zinc concentration and dyslipidemia and its subtypes.

Modulating the surface electron distribution by defects engineering or doping can effectively improve CO2RR performance. Herein, we synthesize the electrocatalyst of Vo-CuO(Sn) nanosheets containing oxygen vacancies and Sn dopants for application in CO2RR-to-CO. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies and Sn atoms substantially reduces the energy barrier for *COOH and *CO intermediate formation, which results in the high efficiency, low overpotential, and superior stability of the CO2RR to CO conversion. This electrocatalyst possesses a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 99.9% for CO at a low overpotential of 420 mV and a partial current density of up to 35.22 mA cm-2 at -1.03 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The FECO of Vo-CuO(Sn) could retain over 95% within a wide potential area from -0.48 to -0.93 V versus RHE. Moreover, we obtain long-term stability for more than 180 h with only a slight decay in its activity.

In this study, therefore, the effects of LBFs on the high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mice were investigated. LBFs showed significant anti-diabetic activity, as evidenced by the recovery of various physical signs (body weight and the level of GLP-1 were increased and water consumption, liver index, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, HOMA-IS, levels of HbA1c, and OGTT were decreased), improving the function of glucose and lipid metabolism (levels of TC and TG in the serum and liver were decreased, mRNA expression of GK, PFK and PPAR\u03b1 were increased, and mRNA expression of G6Pase, PEPCK, PPAR\u03b3, FAS, ACC, and SREBP-1c were inhibited), reduction of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and related mRNA (such as LPS, TLR-4, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3), and restoration of liver tissue structure (characterized with reduction of fat vesicles, remission of hepatocyte swelling, and orderly arrangement of hepatic cords). Moreover, the modulation of gut microbiota of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice was explored. The results showed that Bacteroidales_S24-7_group, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales_vadinBB60_group, Allobaculum, Turicibacter, Coriobacteriaeceae and Enterococcus were the dominant bacteria associated with T2DM. In conclusion, LBFs ameliorated HFD/STZ-induced T2DM in mice through three targets, including improving glucose and lipid metabolism, blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulating gut microbiota, except that the optimal dose of LBFs needs to be further explored.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Streptozocin", "Lycium", "Diet, High-Fat", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Fruit", "Flavonoids", "Blood Glucose", "RNA, Messenger", "Cytokines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, China. zengxx@njau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Wangting", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, China. zengxx@njau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Weiqi", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, China. zengxx@njau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Linwu", "Last Name": "Ran", "Affiliation": "Laboratory animal center of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia, China."}, {"First Name": "Yamei", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Wolfberry Engineering Technology, Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, China. youlongchk@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Wolfberry Engineering Technology, Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, China. youlongchk@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Mi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Wolfberry Engineering Technology, Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, China. youlongchk@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiong", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, China. zengxx@njau.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Youlong", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Wolfberry Engineering Technology, Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Yinchuan 750002, Ningxia, China. youlongchk@163.com."}], "Journal": "Food & function", "PubDate": "2022Oct31"}, {"PMID": "36191684", "Title": "Self-assembled surgical headlights in dermatologic procedures.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["headlights", "lighting device", "surgery"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Visual Perception", "Lighting", "Dermatologic Surgical Procedures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei-Cheng", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Li-Wen", "Last Name": "Chiu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Yng", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Dermatology, Pingtung Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Pingtung, Taiwan.

In this study, 40 groundwater samples were collected from the loose layer aquifer (LA), coal measure aquifer (CA), and limestone aquifer (LA) in the Pansan coal mine, Huanan coalfield, China, and the major ion concentrations were analyzed by bivariate diagrams (Na+ + K+ - Cl- versus Ca2+ + Mg2+ - SO4 2- - HCO3 - and CAI-I versus CAI-II), multivariate statistical methods, and receptor model in order to identify the water-rock interactions and aquifer hydraulic connections. Piper diagram showed that groundwater in LA and TA was dominated by the Na-Cl type, while groundwater in CA was mainly of the Na-HCO3 type. Based on the results of bivariate diagrams and PCA/FA, weathering of silicate minerals and cation exchange (source 1), sulfate dissolution (source 2) and chloride dissolution (source 3) were the main processes controlling the groundwater chemistry. Unmix model revealed that the mean contribution of source 1 to CA samples was 74%, while LA and TA samples have higher contributions from evaporite dissolution (source 2 and source 3) relative to CA samples. Moreover, both clustering analysis methods (Q-type hierarchical and K-means cluster) confirmed the existence of a hydraulic connection between LA and TA in the northeastern part of the study area.

The current study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Jujuboside A (Ju A) on TIF in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mice, and explore its underlying anti-fibrosis mechanism. A mouse T2DM model was established using high fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Then, diabetic mice were treated with Ju A (10, 20 and 40 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1, i.g.) for 12 weeks. Results showed that administration of Ju A not only down-regulated fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, but also improved hyperlipidemia and renal function in diabetic mice. Moreover, the reduced ECM accumulation was observed in the renal cortex of Ju A treated diabetic mice, while the TIF progression was also attenuated by Ju A through blocking the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). Further mechanism studies showed that Ju A treatment effectively down-regulated the protein expression and subsequent nuclear translocation of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in the renal cortex of diabetic mice, and reduced the levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in the serum and renal cortex of Ju A treated mice. According to invitro studies, the up-regulated YY1/TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway was restored by Ju A in high glucose (HG) cultured HK-2 cells.

It is one of the most important factors contributing to reproductive failure. After numerous barriers have been overcome to obtain good-quality embryos, RIF causes extreme distress and frustration in women and couples. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding how inflammatory factors, which include pro-inflammatory factors, anti-inflammatory factors, chemokines, and other molecules, contribute to RIF. Immunological abnormalities, hypercoagulability, and reproductive diseases are considered potential causes of RIF. In alloimmune disorders, inflammatory factors can affect the success rate of embryo implantation by altering T helper (Th)1/Th2 and Th17/regulatory T cell ratios and causing imbalances of uterine natural killer cells and macrophages. Autoimmune disorders can also lead to RIF. Inflammatory factors also play key roles in RIF-related disorders such as hypercoagulability, chronic endometritis, adenomyosis, hydrosalpinx, and endometriosis. This review focuses on the roles of inflammatory factors in RIF, including immune factors, blood hypercoagulable states, and reproductive diseases such as chronic endometritis, adenomyosis, hydrosalpinx, and endometriosis.

Then, the key influencing factors were selected for multi-factor fitting of the release amount. The results showed that the oil release amount rose with the increase in oil concentration, oscillation frequency, and release time, but decreased with an increase in salinity. As the pH decreased, the oil release amount increased. The relationship between release amount and concentration/oscillation frequency can be equipped by the polynomial equation, and the average R2 was 0.95 and 0.84, respectively. The release amount can be fitted by the Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetic equation with time, with the average R2 0.89. The pH was negatively correlated with the release amount in the fresh contaminated sediment but positively correlated with the weathered one. The correlation between each factor and oil release amount was ranked (from large to small) as oil concentration, oscillation frequency, salinity, time, and pH.

Electrical characterization is conducted and verification is performed using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and an optical-pump terahertz (THz)-probe system in terms of simulation and transient response analysis. Owing to the metal-like properties of graphene, a strong interaction between the metasurface and monolayer graphene yields a short-circuit effect, which considerably weakens the intensity of the resonance mode under passive conditions.

Participants were divided into four groups: (1) non-depressed without dementia, (2) non-depressed with probable MCI, (3) depressed without dementia and (4) depressed with probable mild cognitive impairment (MCI). HRQoL was assessed using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms were evaluated with the AD8 and the Geriatric Depression Scale respectively. Activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) disability and other sociodemographic variables were also assessed. The results of this study showed that controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, significant differences in a physical component score (PCS) and a mental component score (MCS) of HRQoL were found across the four groups. Compared to those who were non-depressed without dementia, older adults who were depressed with probable MCI reported the lowest level of PCS and MCS, followed by older adults who were depressed without dementia. Both ADL and IADL disabilities played mediating roles in the relationship between cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms and PCS.

In this work, we proposed a new method to diagnose the abnormal wear state of the disc cutter by using brain-like artificial intelligence to process and analyze the vibration signal in the dynamic contact between the disc cutter and the rock. This method is mainly aimed at realizing the diagnosis and identification of the abnormal wear state of the cutter, and is not aimed at the accurate measurement of the wear amount. The author believes that when the TBM is operating at full power, the cutting forces are very high and the rock is successively broken, resulting in a complex circumstance, which is inconvenient to vibration signal acquisition and transmission. If only a small thrust is applied, to make the cutters just contact with the rock (less penetration), then the cutters will run more smoothly and suffer less environmental interference, which would be beneficial to apply the method proposed in this paper to detect the state of the cutters. A specific example was to use the frequency-domain characteristics of the periodic vibration waveform during the contact between the cutter and the granite to identify the wear status (including normal wear state, wear failure state, angled wear failure state) of the disc cutter through the artificial neural network, and the diagnosis accuracy rate is 90%.", "Keywords": ["disc cutter", "machine learning", "status monitoring", "vibration", "wear"], "MeSH terms": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Perception", "Vibration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaobo", "Last Name": "Pu", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}, {"First Name": "Lingxu", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}, {"First Name": "Kedong", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}, {"First Name": "Liangwu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "China Railway Engineering Equipment Group Technical Service Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}, {"First Name": "Libin", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "China Railway Engineering Equipment Group Technical Service Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}, {"First Name": "Linmao", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Tribology Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}], "Journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2022Sep04"}, {"PMID": "36079863", "Title": "Associations of Dietary Fats with All-Cause Mortality and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality among Patients with Cardiometabolic Disease.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown distinct associations between specific dietary fats and mortality. However, evidence on specific dietary fats and mortality among patients with cardiometabolic disease (CMD) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between consumption of specific fatty acids and survival of patients with CMD and examine whether cardiometabolic biomarkers can mediate the above effects. The study included 8537 participants with CMD, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and NHANES 1999-2014. Cox proportional hazards regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and isocaloric substitution models were used to estimate the associations of dietary fats with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among participants with CMD. Mediation analysis was performed to assess the potential mediating roles of cardiometabolic biomarkers. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years (0-27.1 years), 3506 all-cause deaths and 882 CVD deaths occurred. The hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality among patients with CMD were 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI), 95% CI, 0.73-0.99; p trend = 0.03) for \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-6 PUFA), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00; p trend = 0.05) for linoleic acid (LA), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.98; p trend = 0.03) for docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). Isocalorically replacing energy from SFA with PUFA and LA were associated with 8% and 4% lower all-cause mortality respectively. The HRs of CVD mortality among CMD patients comparing extreme tertiles of specific dietary fats were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48-0.75; p trend = 0.002) for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48-0.85; p trend = 0.002) for DPA and above effects were mediated by levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Restricted cubic splines showed significant negative nonlinear associations between above specific dietary fats and mortality. These results suggest that intakes of \u03c9-6 PUFA, LA, and DPA or replacing SFA with PUFA or LA might be associated with lower all-cause mortality for patients with CMD. Consumption of EPA and DPA could potentially reduce cardiovascular death for patients with CMD, and their effects might be regulated by cardiometabolic biomarkers indirectly.

Though the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 form class IIa of the HDAC superfamily have been found participating in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, while JNK signaling pathway activation was hypothesized as a key cause leading to cell apoptosis, the correlation between HDAC4 and JNK signaling pathway remains unknown. Studies have found that Radix Polygoni Multiflori (RPM) contains a variety of ingredients, such as TSG and Emodin, could exert antioxidant effects, scavenge free radicals, inhibit cell apoptosis and provide neuroprotection, but the underlying mechanism has not fully elucidated yet. In the present study, we further explored the mechanism by which RPM improves the cognitive function of diabetic rats. Simultaneously, TSG and Emodin were used to stimulate HT-22 hippocampal neurons treated with high glucose. After RPM extracts or TSG, Emodin treatments, the cognitive functions of DE rats improved while the hippocampal neurons arranged tighter and increased. Meanwhile, the expression level of HAT, HDAC, HDAC4 and JNK signaling pathway and apoptosis related genes were decreased. Our finds indicates that RPM and Emodin would inhibit HDAC4 expression, curb the activation of the JNK pathway, reduce hippocampal neuron apoptosis and ultimately meliorate the cognitive function from diabetes.

Cladocerans, i.e. zooplankton that plays an important role in the energy flow and material circulation in freshwater ecosystem, usually develop induced defense in response to predation risk. We used atrazine, one of the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies, and the expression of defense-related genes. Atrazine reduced the body size, spine size, growth rate, total offspring, and the relative reproductive output of D. pulex, which further affected the response strength of the morphological and life history defenses, i.e., atrazine significantly reduced the spine size, relative spine size, and fecundity of D. pulex in response to R. ocellatus kairomone. Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes, and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced anti-predation defense of cladocerans. Specially, fish kairomone attenuated the negative effects of high concentrations of atrazine on the life history traits of D. pulex.

Different from RNase II, EcR is capable of degrading structured RNA efficiently, which makes it a potential analysis tool for various RNA species. In this work, we examined the nuclease activity of EcR degrading a series of RNA substrates with various sequences. Our biochemical work reveals that EcR is significantly sensitive to cytosine compared with other bases when catalyzing RNA degradation. EcR shows higher cytosine sensitivity compared to its homolog RNase II when degrading RNAs, and the hydrolysis process of EcR is transiently halted and produces apparent intermediate product when the 1-nt upstream of C is A or U, or G. Furthermore, the substitution of glycine with proline (G273P) in EcR enhances its cytosine sensitivity. These findings expand our understanding of EcR enzymatic activities.

Herein, various Fen and Co5 clusters are designed to screen out the good catalysts with reasonable stability, as well as high activity and selectivity for either C2H4 or CH3CH2OH generation through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The binding energy and cohesive energy calculations show that both Fe5 and Co5 clusters can adsorb stably on the N-doped carbon (NC) with one metal atom anchored at the center of the defected hole via a classical MN4 structure. The proposed reaction pathway demonstrates that the Fe5-NC cluster has better activity than Co5-NC, since the carbon-carbon coupling reaction is the potential determining step (PDS), and the free energy change is 0.22 eV lower in the Fe5-NC cluster than that in Co5-NC. However, Co5-NC shows a better selectivity towards C2H4 since the hydrogenation of CH2CHO to CH3CHO becomes the PDS, and the free energy change is 1.08 eV, which is 0.07 eV higher than that in the C-C coupling step. The larger discrepancy of d band center and density of states (DOS) between the topmost Fe and sub-layer Fe may account for the lower free energy change in the C-C coupling reaction.

Our previous studies found that UBC9 is highly mobile in neurons, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We designed to investigate the underlying mechanism of the synaptic redistribution of UBC9 in AD. We found that \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) significantly decreased presynaptic UBC9 expression and increased postsynaptic UBC9 expression but did not affect UBC9 expression in synaptosomes. Moreover, there is evidence that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may facilitate synaptic gap transmission. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that flotillin, which is specifically expressed in EVs, co-immunoprecipitated with UBC9 in cell lysates and media and that A\u03b2 treatment enhanced this interaction. Additionally, epidermal growth factor and oleanolic acid have been found to either promote or inhibit the release of EVs, thus blocking the A\u03b2-induced presynaptic release of UBC9. However, knockdown of synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP-23) or inhibition of SNAP23 phosphorylation was found to secure A\u03b2-induced presynaptic release of UBC9.

The current study was aimed to evaluate the long-term spatial-temporal distribution of municipal drinking water quality and explore the origin of water contamination based on multiple water indicators of 137 finished water samples and 863 tap water samples from Wuhan city, China. Water quality indexes (WQIs) were calculated to integrate the measured indicators. WQIs of the finished water samples ranged from 0.24 to 0.92, with the qualification rate and excellent rate of 100 % and 96.4 %, respectively, while those of the tap water samples ranged from 0.09 to 3.20, with the qualification rate of 99.9 %, and excellent rate of 95.5 %. Artificial neural network model was constructed based on the time series of WQIs from 2013 to 2019 to predict the water quality thereafter. The predicted WQIs of finished and tap water in 2020 and 2021 qualified on the whole, with the excellent rate of 87.5 % and 92.9 %, respectively. Except for three samples exceeding the limits of free chlorine residual, chloroform and fluoride, respectively, the majority of indicators reached the threshold values for drinking. Our study suggested that municipal drinking water quality in Wuhan was generally stable and in line with the national hygiene standards.

However, a large number of WGS data sets currently lack corresponding quantitative phenotypic data-the MICs. Using MYCOTBI plates, we determined the MICs to nine antituberculosis drugs for 154 clinical multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates from the Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control in Shenzhen, China. Comparing MICs with predicted drug-resistance profiles inferred by WGS showed that WGS could predict the levels of resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. We also found some mutations that may not be associated with drug resistance, such as EmbB D328G, mutations in the gid gene, and C-12T in the eis promoter. However, some strains carrying the same mutations showed different levels of resistance to the corresponding drugs. The MICs of different strains with the RpsL K88R, fabG1 C-15T mutations and some with mutations in embB and rpoB, had MICs to the corresponding drugs that varied by 8-fold or more. This variation is unexplained but could be influenced by the bacterial genetic background. Additionally, we found that 32.3% of rifampicin-resistant isolates were rifabutin-susceptible, particularly those with rpoB mutations H445D, H445L, H445S, D435V, D435F, L452P, S441Q, and S441V. Studying the influence of bacterial genetic background on the MIC and the relationship between rifampicin-resistant mutations and rifabutin resistance levels should improve the ability of WGS to guide the selection of medical treatment regimens. IMPORTANCE Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has excellent potential in drug-resistance prediction. The MICs are essential indications of adding a particular antituberculosis drug dosage or changing the entire treatment regimen. However, the relationship between many known drug-resistant mutations and MICs is unclear, especially for rarer ones. The results showed that WGS could predict resistance levels to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. However, some mutations may not be associated with drug resistance, and some others may confer various MICs to strains carrying them. Also, 32.3% of rifampicin (RIF)-resistant strains were classified as sensitive to rifabutin (RFB), and some mutations in the rpoB gene may be associated with this phenotype. Our data on the MIC distribution of strains with some rarer mutations add to the accumulated data on the resistance level associated with such mutations to help guide further research and draw meaningful conclusions.", "Keywords": ["minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)", "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)", "resistance level", "whole-genome sequencing (WGS)"], "MeSH terms": ["Aminoglycosides", "Antitubercular Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Fluoroquinolones", "Humans", "Isoniazid", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Mutation", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Rifabutin", "Rifampin", "Streptomycin", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinli", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Chuangyue", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Likai", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Weiguo", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control, Shenzhen, China."}], "Journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "PubDate": "2022Jun29"}, {"PMID": "35624478", "Title": "Occupational stress and associated factors among general practitioners in China: a national cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Occupational stress among general practitioners (GPs) is a public health concern.

However, the application of MFs is impeded by their poor electronic/ionic conductivity and severe decomposition of electrolyte.

The composite cathode is composed of nanorod-shaped FeF2 embedded in PDC matrix with excellent mechanical strength and electronic/ionic conductivity. The FeF2 @PDC enables a reversible capacity of 500 mAh g-1 with a record long cycle lifetime of 1900 cycles. Remarkably, the FeF2 @PDC can be cycled at a record rate of 60\u00a0C with a reversible capacity of 107 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles. Advanced electron microscopy reveals that the in situ formation of stable Fe3 O4 layers on the surface of FeF2 prevents the electrolyte decomposition and leaching of iron (Fe), thus enhancing the cyclability.

In this study, the functional biochar (FM-RBC and FM-DBC) was prepared using branch and durian shell biochar (RBC and DBC, respectively) with iron-manganese oxide (Fe-Mn oxide) modification. The behaviors and mechanisms of Cd adsorption and stabilization in water and alkaline soil treated with FM-RBC and FM-DBC were explored. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of RBC and DBC for Cd had increased by 40-80\u00a0mg/g after the Fe-Mn oxide modification. The Cd adsorption was conformed to pseudo-second-order kinetic and the Langmuir isothermal models. After 35 days of soil cultivation, the maximum reduction rate of DTPA-Cd occurred in 3% FM-DBC treatments (37.73%), followed by in 3% FM-RBC (30.08%), all of which were significantly higher than that observed in 3% BC treatments (12.55-18.91%). Notably, the FM-RBC and FM-DBC treatments promoted the conversion of the exchangeable to the carbonate-bound and Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide fractions of Cd. The XRD, FTIR, and XPS analyses demonstrated that the loading amount of Fe-Mn oxide was positively correlated with the oxygen-containing functional group of biochar. CdO, Cd2Mn3O8 and CdCO3 were loaded on the FM-BC, indicating the existence of two main adsorption mechanisms: (1) the complexation with M-O (M: Fe, Mn) and acid oxygen-containing functional groups, (2) the precipitation with carbonate of Cd.

Researchers have since aimed to develop nanoplatforms that can efficiently deliver drugs and contrast medium to tumor and release active ingredients in response to tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions. Herein, we propose a modular strategy, and develop a series of nanoplatforms based on metal-coordinated-polyprodrugs for cancer theranostics. The polyprodrugs were synthesized through a click-reaction between amino acid and doxorubicin (DOX) with dipropiolate. The backbones of the polyprodrugs had intrinsic sensitivities to pH and/or GSH, and provided abundant -COOH, -NH2, or -S-S- to chelate with functional metal ions and further self-assembled to form different morphologies. Dicysteine, which contains disulfide bond (-S-S-), was chosen to copolymerize with DOX and triethylene glycol dipropiolate (TEP) to prepare the pH/GSH dual-responsive polyprodrug poly(dicysteine-co-TEP-co-DOX) (pDTD), then separately coordinated with Gd3+, Fe3+, and Mn2+ to construct nanoplatforms pDTD@M (M representing the metal ions). In vitro and in vivo investigations suggest the metal-coordinated-polyprodrug nanoplatforms have good magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ability and efficient tumor-growth inhibition with high safety. The design strategy of nanoplatforms based on metal-coordinated-polyprodrugs provides a new idea for on-demand construction of promising theranostics agents. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to small molecule antitumor drugs, polymeric drugs have high drug loading ratio and are easily enriched at the tumor site to achieve improved therapy efficacy. This work utilizes click reactions to link amino acids with anticancer drugs to produce polymeric drugs that are degraded in response to tumor microenvironment and released small molecule antitumor drugs mainly in tumor sites, and subtly utilizes the coordination of amino acid to chelate MRI functional metal ion to realize enhanced MRI imaging mediated tumor therapy. This strategy provides a new idea for the convenient construction of polymeric drugs for tumor theranostics.", "Keywords": ["Click reactions", "Ion-driven self-assembly", "Modular nanoplatforms", "Polyprodrugs", "Theranostics"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Doxorubicin", "Humans", "Ions", "Nanoparticles", "Neoplasms", "Polymers", "Precision Medicine", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daquan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Xi'an Key Laboratory of Sustainable Energy Material Chemistry, Xi'an Jiao Tong University, Xi'an 710049, China.

As a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) played an important role not only in regulating fibrosis process, but also in maintaining mitochondrial function of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. However, it was not clear whether YY1 participated in maintaining mitochondrial function of RTECs in early DN-associated TIF. In this study, we dynamically detected mitochondrial functions and protein expression of YY1 in db/db mice and high glucose (HG)-cultured HK-2 cells. Our results showed that comparing with the occurrence of TIF, the emergence of mitochondrial dysfunction of RTECs was an earlier even, besides the up-regulated and nuclear translocated YY1. Correlation analysis showed YY1 expressions were negatively associated with PGC-1\u03b1 in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism research demonstrated the formation of mTOR-YY1 heterodimer induced by HG upregulated YY1, the nuclear translocation of which inactivated PGC-1\u03b1 by binding to the PGC-1\u03b1 promoter. Overexpression of YY1 induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in normal glucose cultured HK-2 cells and 8-week-old db/m mice. While, dysfunctional mitochondria induced by HG could be improved by knockdown of YY1. Finally, downregulation of YY1 could retard the progression of TIF by preventing mitochondrial functions, resulting in the improvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in early DN. These findings suggested that YY1 was a novel regulator of mitochondrial function of RTECs and contributed to the occurrence of early DN-associated TIF .", "Keywords": ["Diabetic nephropathy", "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition", "Mitochondrial", "PGC-1\u03b1", "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis", "Yin Yang 1"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Mitochondria", "Fibrosis", "Glucose", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Diabetes Mellitus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Yinlu", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Shangxiu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyun", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiayu", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Fanglin", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Lin'an District, Hangzhou, 311300, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenzhou", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "New Drug Screening Center, Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Sitong", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xia", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Chujing", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "New Drug Screening Center, Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenglin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxing", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China. yinxx@xzhmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221004, China."}], "Journal": "Cell biology and toxicology", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "35445713", "Title": "Chromatin remodeling complexes regulate genome architecture in Arabidopsis.", "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture maintains genome stability and is important in regulating gene transcription.

Previous researches have shown that an increase in exosomal PD-L1 expression was positively associated with a more advanced clinical stage, a poorer prognosis as well as drug resistance in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). To explore the role of exosomal PD-L1 in ESCC, we performed bioinformatics analysis as well as several in vitro/in vivo functional experiments in a parental sensitive cell line EC-9706 and its derivative, a paclitaxel-resistant subline EC-9706R, and found that the exosomal PD-L1 from EC-9706R was higher than that from EC-9706. Moreover, exosomes from EC-9706R significantly increased invasion, migration and chemoresistance of EC-9706. Anti-PD-L1 treatment in combination with chemotherapy also led to reduced tumor burden in vivo. Inhibition of the release of exosomes by GW4869 or inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by stattic could effectively reverse the resistance to paclitaxel mediated by exosomal PD-L1. Furthermore, we found that PD-L1, miR-21, and multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene are involved in the process of exosomal transfer. Moreover, PD-L1 could enhance miR-21 expression by increasing the enrichment of STAT3 on miR-21 promoter. Our results suggested that exosomal PD-L1 may contribute to drug resistance to paclitaxel by regulating the STAT3/miR-21/PTEN/Akt axis and promote tumorigenic phenotype.

Therefore, the present study adopted the well-established two-rectangle paradigm and used animate and inanimate objects as stimuli to test the abovementioned problems. The results revealed that object-based effects were obtained for both animate and inanimate objects. However, the object-based effects were larger when the cue appeared on the animate objects than on the inanimate objects, due to faster response to invalid same-object trials and slower response to invalid different-object trials. Beyond that, we also further confirmed that animacy itself, not the low-level visual complexity, led to the differential object-based effects. These results suggest that neutral animals also mattered to our attentional allocation and animacy can modulate object-based attentional selection by capturing and holding visual attention on the animate objects.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of carotid atherosclerotic plaques using both GSI imaging biomarkers and serological biomarkers, and further explore their possible roles in the atherogenic process. The present study analyzed GSI data, including calcium content of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and spectral curve slope, as well as serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in patients with a carotid atherosclerotic plaque using GSI-computed tomographic angiography and immunoturbidimetry. Patients with unstable plaque exhibited a significantly lower calcium content and higher spectral curve slope than those of the stable plaque group. In addition, patients with unstable plaque exhibited an increase in Hs-CRP and MCP-1 levels compared with those of the stable plaque and normal control groups. The alteration in GSI calcium content and spectral curve slope reflects a close link between calcification and plaque instability, while aberrant Hs-CRP and MCP-1 expression are involved in the formation or development of vulnerable plaques. Taken together, the present results strongly support the feasibility of using these serological and newly identified imaging parameters as multiple potential biomarkers relevant to plaque vulnerability or stroke progression.", "Keywords": ["gemstone spectral imaging", "high-sensitivity C-reactive protein", "monocyte chemotactic protein-1", "plaque vulnerability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ze-Xin", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, P.R.

In the present study, podophyllotoxin derivatives incorporating piperazinyl-cinnamic amide moieties at 4-position were designed and synthesized. Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral data. ADMET analysis proposed that these compounds had a good distribution and high clearance profile with little toxicity. The cytotoxicity of these derivatives was evaluated against four human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, A549, HeLa and PC-3) by MTT assay.

We conducted a comprehensive genomic epidemiology analysis on 420 cpKP isolates collected from 70 hospitals in 24 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities of China during 2009-2017 by short-/long-read sequencing. The results showed that most cpKP isolates were categorized into clonal group 258 (CG258), in which ST11 was the dominant clone. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major clades including the top one of Clade 3 for CG258 cpKP isolates. Additionally, carbapenemase gene analysis indicated that blaKPC was dominant in the cpKP isolates, and most blaKPC genes were located in five major incompatibility (Inc) groups of blaKPC-harboring plasmids. Importantly, three advantageous combinations of host-blaKPC-carrying plasmid (Clade 3.1+3.2-IncFIIpHN7A8, Clade 3.1+3.2-IncFIIpHN7A8:IncR, and Clade 3.3-IncFIIpHN7A8:IncpA1763-KPC) were identified to confer cpKP isolates the advantages in both genotypes (strong correlation/coevolution) and phenotypes (resistance/growth/competition) to facilitate the nationwide spread of ST11/CG258 cpKP. Intriguingly, Bayesian skyline analysis illustrated that the three advantageous combinations might be directly associated with the strong population expansion during 2007-2008 and subsequent maintenance of the population of ST11/CG258 cpKP after 2008. We then examined drug resistance profiles of these cpKP isolates and proposed combination treatment regimens for CG258/non-CG258 cpKP infections.

When MSCs are exposed to an inflammatory environment, they release more functional growth factors, exosomes, and chemokines. Herein, MSCs are stimulated to alter sEV cargos and functions to regulate the inflammatory microenvironment and promote tissue regeneration. Sequencing of sEV miRNAs shows that certain RNAs conducive to cell function are upregulated. In this study, in vitro cell function experiments show that both inflammation-stimulated adipose-derived MSC (ADSC)-derived sEV (IAE) and normal ADSC-derived sEV (AE) promote cell proliferation; IAE also significantly improves cell migration. Regarding macrophage polarization regulation, IAE significantly promotes M2 macrophage differentiation. RNA-sequencing analysis indicates that high miR-27b-3p expression levels in IAE may regulate macrophages by targeting macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). In vivo, a rabbit temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar osteochondral defect model shows that both AE and IAE promote TMJ regeneration, with IAE having the most significant therapeutic effect. Therefore, the authors confirm that exposing MSCs to an inflammatory environment can feasibly enhance sEV functions and that modified sEVs achieve better therapeutic effects.", "Keywords":

In this work, a mesoporous single-crystalline lithium titanate (MSC-LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long-term stability in LIBs is reported. The MSC-LTO microrods are featured with a single-crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single-crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium-ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single-crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC-LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of \u2248174 mAh g-1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and \u2248169 mAh g-1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single-crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long-term cycling test, offering \u224892% of the initial capacity after 10\u00a0000 cycles at 20 C.

"35244407", "Title": "124I-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody and Fragment for the Noninvasive Evaluation of Tumor PD-L1 Expression In Vivo.", "Abstract": "Lung cancer is a highly heterogeneous cancer and is divided broadly into small and nonsmall cell lung cancer (SCLC or NSCLC). In all NSCLC patients, it is estimated that 50%-60% are programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have shown their clinical application prospects in advanced NSCLC. To avoid unnecessary adverse effects and provide anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to the most appropriate patient population, the PD-L1 expression in patients preparing for treatment must be evaluated accurately and in real time. In this study, we noninvasively evaluate the PD-L1 expression in an NSCLC xenograft using 124I-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of durvalumab (Durva) and compared it with the 124I-labeled intact antibody in terms of the biodistribution and dosimetry. The aim is to develop a nuclide labeled molecular probe with better performance for PD-L1 immunoPET imaging. After cleaving using IdeS protease, the F(ab')2 fragments of Durva were labeled with 124I. The radioligand showed a high radiochemical purity (>96%) and outstanding stability. Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry were performed on the two selected NSCLC cell lines to measure the in vitro PD-L1 expression. The H460 cells showed a much higher PD-L1 expression than the A549 cells, both at the protein level and the mRNA level. In the following cell binding experiment and binding specificity assay, the labeled radioligand showed good affinity to high PD-L1 expression cells and could be blocked with excess unlabeled intact Durva. The results of the biodistribution and the positron emission tomography (PET) image showed that the peak tumor uptake of 124I-Durva-F(ab')2 was close to 124I-Durva, but much earlier (5.29 \u00b1 0.42% ID/g for 124I-Durva-F(ab')2 at 12 h vs 5.18 \u00b1 0.73% ID/g for 124I-Durva at 48 h). Compared with 124I-Durva, an accelerated blood clearance was observed for 124I-Durva-F(ab')2. The faster blood clearance allowed for a higher tumor-to-background ratio, which was reflected on the image in contrast. The H460 tumors showed excellent contrast as early as 4 h after injection with 124I-Durva-F(ab')2, and for 124I-Durva, the xenograft could not be distinguished clearly until 24 h after injection. Interestingly, 124I-Durva-F(ab')2 showed lower accumulations compared to other metal isotopes labeled PD-L1 antibodies in bone, liver, spleen etc., which will be beneficial for metastasis detection. Another benefit of accelerated blood clearance was a reduction in the radiation dose. According to the results of the OLINDA/EXM, the effective dose for the total body of 124I-Durva was 4.25-times greater than that of 124I-Durva-F(ab')2 (186 \u03bcSv/MBq vs 43.8 \u03bcSv/MBq). All of these data indicated that 124I-Durva-F(ab')2 is a promising immunoPET tracer for evaluating the in vivo PD-L1 levels in an NSCLC model and is expected to be successful in future clinical application.", "Keywords": ["F(ab\u2032)2 fragment", "Zr-89", "durvalumab", "nonsmall cell lung cancer", "programmed cell death ligand 1"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Iodine Radioisotopes", "Ligands", "Lung Neoplasms", "Molecular Probes", "Peptide Hydrolases", "RNA, Messenger", "Tissue Distribution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Dai", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhihui", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhan", "Last Name": "Si", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yanzhao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Renjie", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhequan", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Xiu", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qingyu", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Dengfeng", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "PubDate": "2022Oct03"}, {"PMID": "35235310", "Title": "Gold Nanorods/Metal-Organic Framework Hybrids: Photo-Enhanced Peroxidase-Like Activity and SERS Performance for Organic Dyestuff Degradation and Detection.", "Abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used to mimic enzymes for catalyzing chemical reactions; however, low enzyme activity limit their large-scale application. In this work, gold nanorods/metal-organic frameworks (Au NRs/Fe-MOF) hybrids were successfully synthesized for photo-enhanced peroxidase-like catalysis and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The enzyme-like activity of Au NRs/Fe-MOF hybrids was significantly enhanced under localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), because the hot electrons produced on Au NRs surface were transferred into Fe-MOF, activating the Fenton reaction by Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion and preventing the recombination of hot electrons and holes. This photo-enhanced enzyme-like catalytic performance was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), electrochemical analysis, activation energy measurement, and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Afterward, Methylene Blue (MB) was chosen to demonstrate the photo-enhanced peroxidase-like performance of Au NRs/Fe-MOFs. The Au NRs/Fe-MOF caused chemical and electromagnetic enhancement of Raman signals and exhibited a great potential for the detection of toxic chemicals and biological molecules. The detection limit of MB concentration is 9.3 \u00d7 10-12 M. In addition, the Au NRs/Fe-MOF hybrids also showed excellent stability and reproducibility for photo-enhanced peroxidase-like catalysis.

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of the anatomical structure of the stems and leaves of Poa alpigena in overgrazed and enclosed conditions in order to determine the dwarfing morphological mechanism associated with overgrazing. The results show that leaf thickness, leaf epidermal thickness, epidermal cell area, and phloem thickness increased with increased grazing intensity (p < 0.05). In contrast, xylem thickness, mesophyll cell area, and guide wall thickness decreased with an increase in grazing intensity (p < 0.05). Mesophyll cell density was relatively unaffected by grazing intensity. Additionally, the plasticity indices of leaf area, upper epidermal cutin layer thickness, and leaf xylem thickness were higher than 0.5. The plasticity indices of stem tube diameter, epidermal cell size, and epidermal cuticle thickness were greater than 0.4. The results of our study indicate that the structural stem and leaf changes in Poa alpigena are induced by the water and mechanical stresses that occur under grazing conditions. Thus, plateau plants adapt to grazing stress by increasing the thickness of their leaves, cuticles, and phloem. The mesophyll cell area, as well as the stem epidermal cell area of Poa alpigena decreased in response to minor variations in grazing intensity, yet overgrazing did not change its density.

GMDZ is widely used as an efficacious and well-tolerated prescription for depression in clinics. The present study was designed to investigate the main plant of GMDZ for its antidepressant-like effect using the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on rats who received an injection with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) to produce the chemical model. In rats subjected to the UCMS model, forced swim tests, open field tests, and sucrose preference tests were applied to estimate the chronic effect of GMDZ. We found that the oral administration of GMDZ for 21 days significantly alleviated the behavior in rats with depression induced by either UCMS or PCPA. The expression levels of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of the rats with depression were markedly increased by GMDZ. Additionally, rats that received the herbal mixture without licorice showed a markedly lower response than GMDZ. These results suggest that GMDZ may alleviate the depressive-like behaviors in depressive rats, possibly via licorice (Gan Cao), to increase 5-HTT and BDNF signals in the hippocampus. The present study confirmed the antidepressant-like effects of GMDZ.

However, the significance of P cycling on eco-environmental management of MDE lakes is still not fully recognized. In this study, P-cycling mechanism was studied in a typical MDE lake (Wuliangsu Lake, China) based on a Before-After-Control-Impact design, taking advantage of the contrasting states between its 13 sub-lakes (with/without macrophytes and with/without external water flow). Our study demonstrated that P cycling predominantly occurs through \"macrophyte \u2194 sediment\" in the MDE lakes, rather than \"water \u2194 sediment\" as in PDE lakes; the biodynamics of the macrophytes acts as a primary driving force for this self-enforced P cycling. Our findings challenge the present lake eutrophication management strategies, which primarily limited to the water nutrient content, and demonstrate that successful MDE lake restoration should focus on stressors caused by the sustainable \"macrophyte-sediment\" P cycling. Macrophyte harvesting immediately before withering is recommended as the most sustainable technique in environment management for periodically frozen shallow MDE lakes. By this technique, sediment P can be gradually pumped up by the overgrown macrophytes each year until the advent of an alternative stable state (low sediment P, small biomass, and higher diversity), thereby forming a positive feedback loop \"macrophyte harvesting \u2192 less sediment P \u2192 less macrophyte \u2192 higher diversity.\" Also, the catastrophic shift from MDE to PDE is no longer a concern.

Cancer cells gradually become adapted to acidic microenvironment and even acquire increased aggressiveness. They are resistant to apoptosis but exhibit increased autophagy that is essential for their survival. We here show that NF-\u03baB, a master regulator of cellular responses to stress, is upregulated in colorectal cancer cells adapted to acidosis (CRC-AA). NF-\u03baB is more relied upon for survival in CRC-AA than in their parental cells and drives a robust antioxidant response. Supplementation of antioxidant abolishes the increased sensitivity of CRC-AA to NF-\u03baB inhibition or depletion, suggesting that NF-\u03baB supports the survival of CRC-AA by maintaining redox homeostasis. Because SQSTM1/p62 is known to mediate the selective autophagy of GATA4 that augments NF-\u03baB function, we tested whether the enhanced autophagic flux and consequently the reduction of SQSTM1/p62 in CRC-AA cells could activate the GATA4-NF-\u03baB axis. Indeed, GATA4 is upregulated in CRC-AA cells and augments the NF-\u03baB activity that underlies the increased expression of cytokines, inhibition of apoptosis, and reduction of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, secretory factors derived from HCT15-AA cells, the soluble ICAM-1 in particular, also possess antioxidant cytoprotective effect against acidic stress.

The water extract of Lycium barbarum berry (Lyc), containing water-soluble Lycium barbarum polysaccharides and flavonoids, can protect the neuronal injury by reducing oxidative stress and suppressing neuroinflammation. Reseach Design: To demonstrate the long-term radioprotective effect of Lyc, we evaluated the neurobehavioral alterations and the numbers of NeuN, calbindin (CB), and parvalbumin (PV) immunopositive hippocampal neurons in BALB/c mice after acute 5.5\u00a0Gy radiation with/without oral administration of Lyc at the dosage of 10\u00a0g/kg daily for 4\u00a0weeks. Results: The results showed that Lyc could improve irradiation-induced animal weight loss, depressive behaviors, spatial memory impairment, and hippocampal neuron loss. Immunohistochemistry study demonstrated that the loss of NeuN-immunopositive neuron in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, CB-immunopositive neuron in CA1 strata radiatum, lacunosum moleculare and oriens, and PV-positive neuron in CA1 stratum pyramidum and stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus after irradiation were significantly improved by Lyc treatment. Conclusion: The neuroprotective effect of Lyc on those hippocampal neurons may benefit the configuration of learning related neuronal networks and then improve radiation induced neurobehavioral changes such as cognitive impairment and depression. It suggests that\u00a0Lycium barbarum\u00a0berry may be an alternative food supplement to prevent radiation-induced neuron loss and neuropsychological disorders.", "Keywords": ["Lycium barbarum berry", "calbindin", "cognitive dysfunction", "ionizing radiation", "parvalbumin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Qian-Qian", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Piao-Qin", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao-Qun", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xue-Zhi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Chun", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiang-Rong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Science Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng-Ru", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Radiation Physiology Laboratory, Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}], "Journal": "Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society", "PubDate": "2021Oct-Dec"}, {"PMID": "37786564", "Title": "Breakthroughs on the clinical management of headache and questions that need to be solved.", "Abstract": "Headache is a common refractory disorder among adults, especially in females, which can lower the quality of life in patients and increase medical costs.

However, the NT-proBNP level is easily affected by renal insufficiency, which limits its clinical use. Methods: This study included 396 patients with CKD. Plasma levels of NT-proBNP and cystatin C (CysC) were measured during hospitalization. The echocardiographic parameters were also detected. Patients were divided into the heart failure group and control group according to the European Society of Cardiology Guideline on Chronic Heart Failure 2021. Multiple modeling analysis of the values of NT-proBNP and CysC, including NT-proBNP/Cyscn and NT-proBNP/nCysC was performed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, combined with the cardiac function, was used to determine the formula with the best diagnostic efficiency. Then, the sensitivity and specificity of new predictors for cardiac insufficiency in CKD patients were calculated. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between new predictors and the NT-proBNP level. The clinical data of CKD patients from another local hospital were used to validate the new predictors and the cut-off values. Results: An elevated NT-proBNP/CysC1.53 ratio was an independent risk factor for cardiac dysfunction in CKD and the best predictor derived from multiple modeling analysis. There was no correlation between the NT-proBNP/CysC1.53 ratio and the NT-proBNP level (r = 0.376, p = 6.909). The area under the ROC curve for the NT-proBNP/CysC1.53 ratio was 0.815 (95% confidence interval: 0.772-0.858), and for a cut-off point of 847.964, this ratio had a sensitivity of 78.24%, and a specificity of 69.44%. When applied to the data of CKD patients from another local hospital, the NT-proBNP to CysC1.53 ratio had a sensitivity of 70.27% and a specificity of 67.74%.

There have been three generation drugs developed to treat of NSCLC. The third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Rociletinib and Osimertinib (AZD9291) achieved remarkable clinical efficacy. However, due to the inhibitory activity against the wild-type EGFR, the side effect of associated skin rash and gastrointestinal toxicity appeared. Thus, there is still an urgent need to develop novel inhibitors with potent inhibitory activity and high selectivity for T790M-containing EGFR over EGFRWT. Herein, guided by the molecular dynamic simulation results, a series of potent and selective Osimertinib derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated. The promising compounds 7f, 7g, 7k, 7m and 7n demonstrated excellent kinase inhibitory activity and high selectivity for EGFRT790M/L858R mutant. The selectivity of 7m to EGFRT790M/L858R was the highest in the current known compounds near to 2500-fold.

Excessive ROS cause cell death or senescence and mediates the therapeutic effect of many cancer drugs. Recent studies showed that ROS increasingly accumulate during G2/M arrest, the underlying mechanism, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that in cancer cells treated with anticancer agent TH287 or paclitaxel that causes M arrest, mitochondria accumulate robustly and produce excessive mitochondrial superoxide, which causes oxidative DNA damage and undermines cell survival and proliferation. While mitochondrial mass is greatly increased in cells arrested at M phase, the mitochondrial function is compromised, as reflected by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased SUMOylation and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, as well as an increased metabolic reliance on glycolysis. CHK1 functional disruption decelerates cell cycle, spares the M arrest and attenuates mitochondrial oxidative stress. Induction of mitophagy and blockade of mitochondrial biogenesis, measures that reduce mitochondrial accumulation, also decelerate cell cycle and abrogate M arrest-coupled mitochondrial oxidative stress. These results suggest that cell cycle progression and mitochondrial homeostasis are interdependent and coordinated, and that impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis and the associated redox signaling may mediate the antineoplastic effect of the M arrest-inducing chemotherapeutics. Our findings provide insights into the fate of cells arrested at M phase and have implications in cancer therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitosis", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaohe", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenqing", "Last Name": "Bu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Institutes for Translational Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Guosheng", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Limei", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojie", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Institutes for Translational Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Institutes for Translational Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaoqin", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China."}, {"First Name": "Changshun", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory of Experimental Teratology, Department of Genetics, Shandong University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China. shaoc@suda.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Oncogene", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34770221", "Title": "The Unmet Medical Demand among China's Urban Residents.", "Abstract": "Our work aimed to build a reasonable proxy for unmet medical demands of China's urban residents.

Here, we reported that the expression of CD95 in CD4+ effector memory T (CD4+ TEM) cells was increased in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients. We also found increased expression of CD95 in CD4+ TEM cells from MG patients correlated positively with clinical severity scores (QMGs), serum IL-17 levels and plasma cells (PCs) frequencies. Conventional treatment, such as glucocorticoid, could down-regulate the expression of CD95 in CD4+ TEM cells, QMGs, serum IL-17 levels and PCs frequencies from MG patients. In vitro, low-dose of agonistic anti-CD95 mAb could promote Th17 cell development. This effect was reversed by CD95 siRNA. Moverover, CD95 stimulation induced the phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2 and Th17 cell differentiation, and p38 specific inhibitor SB203580 or Erk1/2 specific inhibitor PD98059 could induce opposite changes.

However, neither smokers nor active smokers had a greater or lower risk of NMOSD than their nonsmoking counterparts.Our preliminary study showed no significant association between cigarette smoking and the risk of NMOSD, strongly suggesting that, unlike MS, cigarette smoking might not confer NMOSD susceptibility, at least in the Northern Han Chinese population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "China", "Cigarette Smoking", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuromyelitis Optica", "Odds Ratio", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Nicotiana"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "He", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Pen-Ju", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tian-Tong", "Last Name": "Niu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ze-Yi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Bao-Lei", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang-Zhi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Medicine", "PubDate": "2021Sep17"}, {"PMID": "34612806", "Title": "Structure and Function of the Bestrophin family of calcium-activated chloride channels.", "Abstract": "Bestrophins are a family of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) with relevance to human physiology and a myriad of eye diseases termed \"bestrophinopathies\". Since the identification of bestrophins as CaCCs nearly two decades ago, extensive studies from electrophysiological and structural biology perspectives have sought to define their key channel features including calcium sensing, gating, inactivation, and anion selectivity. The initial X-ray crystallography studies on the prokaryotic homolog of Best1, Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpBest), and the Best1 homolog from Gallus gallus (chicken Best1, cBest1), laid the foundational groundwork for establishing the architecture of Best1. Recent progress utilizing single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy has further elucidated the molecular mechanism of gating in cBest1 and, separately, the structure of Best2 from Bos taurus (bovine Best2, bBest2). Meanwhile, whole-cell patch clamp, planar lipid bilayer, and other electrophysiologic analyses using these models as well as the human Best1 (hBest1) have provided ample evidence describing the functional properties of the bestrophin channels. This review seeks to consolidate these structural and functional results to paint a broad picture of the underlying mechanisms comprising the bestrophin family's structure-function relationship.", "Keywords": ["Best1", "Best2", "Bestrophin function", "Bestrophins", "bestrophin structure"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bestrophins", "Calcium", "Cattle", "Chloride Channels", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Eye Proteins", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aaron P", "Last Name": "Owji", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alec", "Last Name": "Kittredge", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Channels (Austin, Tex.)", "PubDate": "2021Dec"}, {"PMID": "34603544", "Title": "Hard to initiate sleep: a new paradigm for resting-state fMRI.", "Abstract": "A better understanding of the neural mechanism of sleep initiation is helpful for sleep health. Our current study aimed to develop a new paradigm that is suitable for using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the inability to initiate sleep. We recruited 28 subjects from nearby communities, in addition to traditionally resting-state eyes-closed condition (EC), they were further asked to try-to-sleep (TTS) in the MRI scanner. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract the large-scale brain networks. No significant difference was found between EC and TTS in the amplitude of brain activity, nor the functional connectivity. However, under the condition of TTS, there was a significant negative correlation between functional connectivity and sleep quality. The results suggesting that the stronger the functional connectivity between the visual network and default mode network, the worse the sleep quality. The results of our research presented here suggested the increased integration among the visual thought-related networks of poor sleepers during sleep onset. More importantly, this study attempt to combine the sleep latency test with resting-state fMRI, and it may help us to investigate the neural mechanism of sleep initiation problem.", "Keywords": ["Functional connectivity", "Insomnia disorder", "Large-scale networks", "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Sleep initiation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Sleep and NeuroImaging Center, Faculty of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715 China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojuan", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Sleep and NeuroImaging Center, Faculty of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715 China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Sleep and NeuroImaging Center, Faculty of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715 China."}], "Journal": "Cognitive neurodynamics", "PubDate": "2021Oct"}, {"PMID": "34582193", "Title": "Asymmetric Domino Heck/Dearomatization Reaction of \u03b2-Naphthols to Construct Indole-Terpenoid Frameworks.", "Abstract": "A palladium-catalyzed enantioselective Heck cyclization/dearomatization cascade via capturing the cyclized Heck \u03c0-allylpalladium intermediate by \u03b2-naphthols is reported, which provides a new strategy for the construction of chiral indole-terpenoid frameworks.
