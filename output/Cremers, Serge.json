organ transplant recipients. Available assays generally correlate well with each other but little attention is given to patients in whom tacrolimus metabolite concentrations might be elevated, which could lead to artificially increased tacrolimus concentrations assessed by cross-reacting immunoassays. We addressed this hypothesis by investigating the correlation between four different assays (two immunoassays and two mass-spectrometry assays) in both a population with normal and a population with high dose requirements. Routine blood samples were collected in 37 control (CO) and 72 high dose patients (HD). Tacrolimus was measured with a CMIA, an ECLIA and two LCMS assays. Results were investigated using Deming regression analysis, Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots and by calculating bias. The CMIA demonstrated a positive bias of 23-26% compared with both LCMS assays. The correlation between CMIA and LCMS assays was good for the CO (r\u2009=\u20090.96) but less so for the HD group (r\u2009=\u20090.91). The ECLIA showed a positive bias of 11-13% compared with both LCMS assays. The correlation between ECLIA and LCMS assays was also good for the CO (r\u2009=\u20090.95) but again less for the HD group (r\u2009=\u20090.93). The correlation for both LCMS assays was excellent for either group (r\u2009>\u20090.99) with no bias. CMIA, ECLIA and LCMS assays for tacrolimus therefore correlate well for trough concentrations from solid organ transplant recipients. However, inter-assay differences exist, which seem more pronounced in patients who need a high dose of tacrolimus to reach a trough concentration in the therapeutic range.", "Keywords": ["TDM", "assay", "comparison", "metabolites", "tacrolimus"], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Assay", "Drug Monitoring", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Mass Spectrometry", "Tacrolimus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Lyashchenko", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex J", "Last Name": "Rai", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Hayden", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, Weil-Cornell University Medical School, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amitava", "Last Name": "Dasgupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Demetra", "Last Name": "Tsapepas", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation", "PubDate": "2022May"}, {"PMID": "34773656", "Title": "Ethics in clinical pharmacology: Facilitating public trust.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pharmacology, Clinical", "Trust"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emma F", "Last Name": "Magavern", "Affiliation": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Piasecki", "Affiliation": "Department of Philosophy and Bioethics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "British journal of clinical pharmacology", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34771668", "Title": "A Phase Ib Study of Sotrastaurin, a PKC Inhibitor, and Alpelisib, a PI3K\u03b1 Inhibitor, in Patients with Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.", "Abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare subset of melanoma characterized by the presence of early initiating GNAQ/11 mutations, with downstream activation of the PKC, MAPK, and PI3K\u03b1 pathways. Activity has been observed with the PKC inhibitors sotrastaurin (AEB071) and darovasertib (IDE196) in patients with UM. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway enhances PKC inhibition in in vivo models. We therefore conducted a phase Ib study of sotrastaurin in combination with the PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor alpelisib to identify a tolerable regimen that may enhance the activity of PKC inhibition alone. Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (n = 24) or GNAQ/11 mutant cutaneous melanoma (n = 1) were enrolled on escalating dose levels of sotrastaurin (100-400 mg BID) and alpelisib (200-350 mg QD). The primary objective was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of these agents when administered in combination. Treatment-related adverse events (AE) occurred in 86% (any grade) and 29% (Grade 3). No Grade 4-5-related AEs occurred. Dose Level 4 (sotrastaurin 200 mg BID and alpelisib 350 mg QD) was identified as the maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated increasing concentration levels with increasing doses of sotrastaurin and alpelisib, without evidence of interaction between agents. Pharmacodynamic assessment of pMARCKS and pAKT protein expression with drug exposure suggested modest target inhibition that did not correlate with clinical response. No objective responses were observed, and median progression-free survival was 8 weeks (range, 3-51 weeks).

However, this option has not yet been widely embraced by the oncology community. Some reasons for this include increased logistical complexity of dose individualization, the lack of clinical laboratories that measure small molecule drug concentrations in support of patient care, and the lack of reimbursement of costs. However, the main obstacle may be the lack of studies clearly demonstrating that monitoring of oral small molecule anticancer drug levels actually improves clinical outcomes. Without unequivocal evidence in support of TDM-guided dose individualization, especially demonstration of improved survival with TDM in randomized controlled trials, wide acceptance of this approach by oncologists and reimbursement by insurance companies is unlikely, and patients may continue to suffer as a result of receiving incorrect drug doses.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) have been in clinical use for over five decades and during this period clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations have been instrumental for the identification of optimal dose regimens in patients. Ideal clinical PK and PD studies help drug developers explain variability in responses and enable the identification of a dose regimen with an optimal effect. PK and PD studies of the unique and rather complex pharmacological properties of BPs also help determine to a significant extent ideal dosing for these drugs. Clinical PK and PD evaluations of BPs preferably use study designs and assays that enable the assessment of both short- (days) and long-term (years) presence and effect of these drugs in patients. BPs are mainly used for metabolic bone diseases because they inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and the best way to quantify their effects in humans is therefore by measuring biochemical markers of bone resorption in serum and urine. In these very same samples BP concentrations can also be measured. Short-term serum and urine data after both intravenous (IV) and oral administration enable the assessment of oral bioavailability as well as the amount of BP delivered to the skeleton. Longer-term data provide information on the anti-resorptive effect as well as the elimination of the BP from the skeleton. Using PK-PD models to mathematically link the anti-resorptive action of the BPs to the amount of BP at the skeleton provides a mechanism-based explanation of the pattern of bone resorption during treatment. These models have been used successfully during the clinical development of BPs. Newer versions of such models, which include systems pharmacology and disease progression models, are more comprehensive and include additional PD parameters such as BMD and fracture risk. Clinical PK and PD studies of BPs have been useful for the identification of optimal dose regimens for metabolic bone diseases. These analyses will also continue to be important for newer research directions, such as BP use in the delivery of other drugs to the bone to better treat bone metastases and bone infections, as well as the potential benefit of BPs at non-skeletal targets for the prevention and treatments of soft tissue cancers, various fibroses, and other cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases,\u00a0and\u00a0reduction in mortality and extension of lifespan.", "Keywords": ["Bisphosphonates", "Clinical pharmacology", "Pharmacodynamics", "Pharmacokinetics", "Pharmacology"], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Diseases, Metabolic", "Bone Neoplasms", "Bone Resorption", "Diphosphonates", "Humans", "Osteoclasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Pathology & Cell Biology and Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States of America.

Smoking has been shown to exacerbate or contribute to impaired immune function in men chronically exposed to arsenic. In contrast, vitamin D (VitD) is known to have a positive influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. The effect of circulating VitD on arsenic-associated immune dysfunction is not known. Here we examine the relationship of arsenic exposure and T cell proliferation (TCP), a measure of immune responsiveness, and circulating VitD among adult men and women in Bangladesh. Arsenic exposure was assessed using total urinary arsenic as well as urinary arsenic metabolites all adjusted for urinary creatinine. TCP was measured ex vivo in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 614 adult participants enrolled in the Bangladesh Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study; serum VitD was also evaluated. The influence of cigarette smoking on arsenic-induced TCP modulation was assessed only in males as there was an inadequate number of female smokers. These studies show that arsenic suppressed TCP in males. The association was significantly strong in male smokers and to a lesser extent in male non-smokers. Interestingly, we found a strong protective effect of high/sufficient serum VitD levels on TCP among non-smoking males. Furthermore, among male smokers with low serum VitD (\u229420 ng/ml), we found a strong suppression of TCP by arsenic. On the other hand, high VitD (>20 ng/ml) was found to attenuate effects of arsenic on TCP among male-smokers. Overall, we found a strong protective effect of VitD, when serum levels were >20 ng/ml, on arsenic-induced inhibition of TCP in men, irrespective of smoking status.

In the 50 years that have elapsed since then, the BPs have become the leading drugs for the treatment of skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone resorption, including Paget's disease of bone, bone metastases, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis and several childhood inherited disorders. The discovery and development of the BPs as a major class of drugs for the treatment of bone diseases is a paradigm for the successful journey from \"bench to bedside and back again\". Several of the leading BPs achieved \"blockbuster\" status as branded drugs. However, these BPs have now come to the end of their patent life, making them highly affordable. The opportunity for new clinical applications for BPs also exists in other areas of medicine such as ageing, cardiovascular disease and radiation protection. Their use as inexpensive generic medicines is therefore likely to continue for many years to come. Fifty years of research into the pharmacology of bisphosphonates have led to a fairly good understanding about how these drugs work and how they can be used safely in patients with metabolic bone diseases. However, while we seemingly know much about these drugs, a number of key aspects related to BP distribution and action remain incompletely understood.

Chronic activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by mutant Htt (mHtt) results in cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone protein located in the ER. Our previous studies demonstrated that mHtt caused PDI to accumulate at mitochondria-associated ER membranes and triggered cell death, and that modulating PDI activity using small molecules protected cells again mHtt toxicity in cell and brain slice models of HD. In this study, we demonstrated that PDI is upregulated in the HD human brain, in cell and mouse models. Chronic administration of a reversible, brain penetrable small molecule PDI modulator, LOC14 (20 mg/kg/day), significantly improved motor function, attenuated brain atrophy and extended survival in the N171-82Q HD mice. Moreover, LOC14 preserved medium spiny neuronal marker dopamine- and cyclic-AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32\u00a0000 (DARPP32) levels in the striatum of HD mice. Mechanistic study revealed that LOC14 suppressed mHtt-induced ER stress, indicated by repressing the abnormally upregulated ER stress proteins in HD models. These findings suggest that LOC14 is promising to be further optimized for clinical trials of HD, and modulation of signaling pathways coping with ER stress may constitute an attractive approach to reduce mHtt toxicity and identify new therapeutic targets for treatment of HD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Atrophy", "Blotting, Western", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Female", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Protein Disulfide-Isomerases", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Kaplan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Gaschler", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhipeng", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mali", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roseann", "Last Name": "Zott", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenzhen", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2018May01"}, {"PMID": "29311066", "Title": "Population Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous Polymyxin B from Clinical Samples.", "Abstract": "A retrospective study was conducted in hospitalized patients receiving intravenous polymyxin B who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring during treatment.

We report for the first time, a strong correlation between the NF1 status of tumor cells and increased sensitivity to glutamine deprivation and glutaminase inhibition. Soft-tissue cell lines null for NF1 were highly dependent on glutamine for proliferation and showed decreased mTORC1 and Ras activity in response to glutaminase inhibition. Re-addition of glutamine or intermediary metabolite such as glutamate to the media restored mTORC1 and Ras activity. SiRNA mediated NF1 knockdown in wild-type NF1 cell line shows increased sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition. Conversely, NF1 overexpression in NF1 null cell lines results in reduced sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition, and restores mTORC1 signaling and Ras activity.

Under physiological conditions, PTH has actions that are more targeted to homeostasis and to bone accrual. The predominant action of PTH, either catabolic, anabolic or homeostatic, can be understood in molecular and pharmacokinetic terms. When administered intermittently, PTH increases bone mass, but when present continuously and in excess (e.g. PHPT), bone loss ensues. This dual effect of PTH depends not only on the dosing regimen, continuous or intermittent, but also on how the PTH molecule interacts with various states of its receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) influencing downstream signalling pathways differentially. Altering the amino-terminal end of PTH or PTHrP could emphasize the state of the receptor that is linked to an osteoanabolic outcome. This concept led to the development of a PTHrP analogue that interacts preferentially with the transiently linked state of the receptor, emphasizing an osteoanabolic effect. However, designing PTH or PTHrP analogues with prolonged state of binding to the receptor would be expected to be linked to a homeostatic action associated with the tonic secretory state of the parathyroid glands that is advantageous in treating hypoparathyroidism. Ideally, further development of a drug delivery system that mimics the physiological tonic, circadian, and pulsatile profile of PTH would be optimal.

to country; the global average defined prevalence is 40 per 100\u2009000 (0.04%). Some occur in only one or a few patients. However, collectively rare disorders are fairly common, affecting 6-8% of the US population, or about 30 million people, and a similar number in the European Union. Most of them affect children and most are genetically determined. Diagnosis can be difficult, partly because of variable presentations and partly because few clinicians have experience of individual rare disorders, although they may be assisted by searching databases. Relatively few rare disorders have specific pharmacological treatments (so-called orphan drugs), partly because of difficulties in designing trials large enough to determine benefits and harms alike. Incentives have been introduced to encourage the development of orphan drugs, including tax credits and research aids, simplification of marketing authorization procedures and exemption from fees, and extended market exclusivity. Consequently, the number of applications for orphan drugs has grown, as have the costs of using them, so much so that treatments may not be cost-effective. It has therefore been suggested that not-for-profit organizations that are socially motivated to reduce those costs should be tasked with producing them. A growing role for patient organizations, improved clinical and translational infrastructures, and developments in genetics have also contributed to successful drug development. The translational discipline of clinical pharmacology is an essential component in drug development, including orphan drugs. Clinical pharmacologists, skilled in basic pharmacology and its links to clinical medicine, can be involved at all stages. They can contribute to the delineation of genetic factors that determine clinical outcomes of pharmacological interventions, develop biomarkers, design and perform clinical trials, assist regulatory decision making, and conduct postmarketing surveillance and pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacoeconomic assessments.", "Keywords": ["clinical pharmacology", "drug development", "orphan drugs", "orphan products", "rare diseases", "rare disorders"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Drug Approval", "Drug Discovery", "European Union", "Humans", "Japan", "Legislation, Drug", "Motivation", "Orphan Drug Production", "Prevalence", "Rare Diseases", "Translational Research, Biomedical", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology & Cell Biology and Medicine, and Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey K", "Last Name": "Aronson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Radcliffe Infirmary, Woodstock Road, Oxford,, OX2 6GG, UK."}], "Journal": "British journal of clinical pharmacology", "PubDate": "2017Aug"}, {"PMID": "28570936", "Title": "A UPLC-MS/MS method for the quantitation of Ulipristal acetate in human serum.", "Abstract": "The progesterone receptor modulator, Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has proven to be an effective emergency contraceptive. Conflicting data has been reported that suggests different efficacy of the drug in different populations, which may be explained by the systemic exposure to the drug. A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the accurate and sensitive measurement of UPA in human serum to address this matter. UPA was extracted from human serum using liquid-liquid extraction with a combination of hexane and dichloromethane. An analytical platform comprising reverse-phase chromatographic separation followed by mass spectrometric detection by positive electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantitation of UPA within 7min. The method was linear from 0.1 to 250ng/mL. The matrix effect was minimal and intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were all within the acceptable limits.

Isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors are emerging as potentially more targeted agents. ACY-1215 (ricolinostat) is a first-in-class selective HDAC6 inhibitor. To better understand the discrete function of HDAC6 and its role in lymphoma, we developed a lymphoma cell line resistant to ACY-1215.Experimental Design: The diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line OCI-Ly10 was exposed to increasing concentrations of ACY-1215 over an extended period of time, leading to the development of a resistant cell line. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed to investigate differentially expressed genes. Combination studies of ACY-1215 and ibrutinib were performed in cell lines, primary human lymphoma tissue, and a xenograft mouse model.Results: Systematic incremental increases in drug exposure led to the development of distinct resistant cell lines with IC50 values 10- to 20-fold greater than that for parental lines. GEP revealed upregulation of MAPK10, HELIOS, HDAC9, and FYN, as well as downregulation of SH3BP5 and LCK. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed modulation of the BTK pathway. Ibrutinib was found to be synergistic with ACY-1215 in cell lines as well as in 3 primary patient samples of lymphoma. In vivo confirmation of antitumor synergy was demonstrated with a xenograft of DLBCL.Conclusions: The development of this ACY-1215-resistant cell line has provided valuable insights into the mechanistic role of HDAC6 in lymphoma and offered a novel method to identify rational synergistic drug combinations.

Few studies have measured vitamin D concentrations in adipose of obese (OB) subjects, and none have included normal weight controls (C). The goal of this study was to investigate whether the relationship between body composition, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), vitamin D in subcutaneous (SQ) and omental (OM) adipose, and total adipose stores of vitamin D differ among OB and C. Obese women undergoing bariatric surgery and normal-weight women undergoing abdominal surgery for benign gynecologic conditions were enrolled. Subjects had measurements of serum 25OHD by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Vitamin D concentrations in SQ and OM adipose were measured by mass spectroscopy. Thirty-six women were enrolled. Serum 25OHD was similar between groups (OB 27\u2009\u00b1\u20092 versus C 26\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009ng/mL; p\u2009=\u20090.71). Adipose vitamin D concentrations were not significantly different in either SQ (OB 34\u2009\u00b1\u20099 versus C 26\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009ng/g; p\u2009=\u20090.63) or OM compartments (OB 51\u2009\u00b1\u200913 versus C 30\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009ng/g; p\u2009=\u20090.37). The distribution of vitamin D between SQ and OM compartments was similar between groups. Serum 25OHD was directly related to adipose vitamin D in both groups. Total body vitamin D stores were significantly greater in OB than in C (2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 versus 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009mg, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.01). In summary, although OB had significantly greater total vitamin D stores than C, the relationship between serum 25OHD and fat vitamin D and the overall pattern of distribution of vitamin D between the OM and SQ fat compartments was similar. Our data demonstrate that obese subjects have greater adipose stores of vitamin D. They support the hypotheses that the enlarged adipose mass in obese individuals serves as a reservoir for vitamin D and that the increased amount of vitamin D required to saturate this depot may predispose obese individuals to inadequate serum 25OHD. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE-FAT INTERACTIONS", "DISORDERS OF CALCIUM/PHOSPHATE METABOLISM", "NUTRITION"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adiposity", "Adult", "Body Weight", "Female", "Humans", "Obesity", "Omentum", "Subcutaneous Fat", "Vitamin D"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Carrelli", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Bucovsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Horst", "Affiliation": "Heartland Assays, LLC, Ames, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology & Cell Biology and Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chengchen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Bessler", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Schrope", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Evanko", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jody", "Last Name": "Blanco", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shonni J", "Last Name": "Silverberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2017Feb"}, {"PMID": "27742501", "Title": "Sclerostin measurement in human disease: Validity and current limitations.", "Abstract": "Sclerostin a potent regulator of bone formation, is an antagonist of the Wnt-signaling pathway.

Here we studied postprandial lipemia in children and young adults to determine whether an increasing degree of CKD results in\u00a0a\u00a0proportional increase in triglyceride and chylomicron concentration. Secondary goals were to determine whether subnephrotic proteinuria, apolipoprotein (apo)C-III and insulin resistance modify the CKD effect. Eighteen fasting participants (mean age of 15 years, mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) underwent a\u00a0postprandial challenge with a high fat milkshake. Triglycerides, apoB-48, insulin, and other markers were measured before and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours afterward. Response was assessed by the incremental area under the\u00a0curve of triglycerides and of apoB-48. The primary hypothesis was tested by correlation to estimated GFR. Significantly, for every 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated GFR, the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides was 17% greater while that of apoB-48 was 16% greater. Univariate analyses also showed that the incremental area\u00a0under the curve of triglycerides and apoB-48 were significantly associated with subnephrotic proteinuria, apoC-III, and insulin resistance. In multivariate analysis, CKD and insulin resistance were independently associated with increased area under the curve and were each linked\u00a0to increased levels of apoC-III. Thus, postprandial triglyceride and chylomicron plasma excursions are increased in direct proportion to the degree of CKD. Independent effects are associated with subclinical insulin resistance and increased apoC-III is linked to both CKD and\u00a0insulin resistance.", "Keywords": ["chronic kidney disease", "insulin resistance", "lipids", "nutrition", "pediatric nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Apolipoprotein B-48", "Apolipoprotein C-III", "Child", "Chylomicrons", "Fasting", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Hypertriglyceridemia", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Postprandial Period", "Proteinuria", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Triglycerides", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Saland", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.

Our previous studies showed that a high high-saturated -fat diet induced greater bone loss in mice than a high high-unsaturated-fat diet due to increased osteoclast numbers and activity. The impact of elevated FA levels on osteoblasts is not yet clear. We induced obesity in 4\u00a0week old male mice using a palmitic acid (PA)- or oleic acid (OA)-enriched high fat high-fat diet (HFD) (20\u00a0% of calories from FA), and compared them to mice on a normal (R) caloric diet (10\u00a0% of calories from FA). We collected serum to determine FA and bone metabolism marker levels. Primary osteoblasts were isolated; cultured in PA, OA, or control (C) medium; and assessed for mineralization activity, gene expression, and ceramide levels. Obese animals in the PA and OA groups had significantly lower serum levels of bone formation markers P1NP and OC compared to normal weight animals (*p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with the lowest marker levels in animals on an PA-enriched HFD (*p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Accordingly, elevated levels of PA significantly reduced osteoblast mineralization activity in vitro (*p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Elevated PA intake significantly increased C16 ceramide accumulation. This accumulation was preventable through inhibition of SPT2 (serine palmitoyl transferase 2) using myriocin. Elevated levels of PA reduce osteoblast function in vitro and bone formation markers in vivo.

We recently discovered that obesity activates a previously unknown pathway that promotes both excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) and defective insulin signaling in hepatocytes, leading to exacerbation of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obesity. At the hub of this new pathway is a kinase cascade involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPKAPK2/3 (MK2/3). Genetic-based inhibition of these kinases improves metabolism in obese mice. Here, we report that treatment of obese insulin-resistant mice with an allosteric MK2/3 inhibitor, compound (cmpd) 28, ameliorates glucose homeostasis by suppressing excessive HGP and enhancing insulin signaling.

Cervical collagens are known to remodel extensively in mice with progressing gestation leading to a soft cervix at term. During this process, mature crosslinked collagens are hypothesized to be replaced with immature less crosslinked collagens to facilitate cervical softening and ripening. To determine the mechanical role of collagen crosslinks during normal mouse cervical remodeling, tensile load-to-break tests were conducted for the following time points: nonpregnant (NP), gestation day (d) 6, 12, 15, 18 and 24 hr postpartum (PP) of the 19-day gestation period. Immature crosslinks (HLNL and DHLNL) and mature crosslinks (DPD and PYD) were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). There were no significant changes in the total immature crosslink density (HLNL+DHLNL mol per collagen mol) throughout normal mouse gestation (range: 0.31-0.49). Total mature crosslink density (PYD+DPD mol per collagen mol) decreased significantly in early softening from d6 to d15 (d6: 0.17, d12: 0.097, d15: 0.026) and did not decrease with further gestation.

protocols after kidney transplantation has become common, but the effects on fracture risk and bone quality are unclear. We enrolled 47 first-time adult transplant recipients managed with ECSW into a 1-year study to evaluate changes in bone mass, microarchitecture, biomechanical competence, and remodeling with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and bone turnover markers obtained at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Compared with baseline, 12-month areal bone mineral density by DXA did not change significantly at the spine and hip, but it declined significantly at the 1/3 and ultradistal radii (2.2% and 2.9%, respectively; both P<0.001). HRpQCT of the distal radius revealed declines in cortical area, density, and thickness (3.9%, 2.1%, and 3.1%, respectively; all P<0.001), trabecular density (4.4%; P<0.001), and stiffness and failure load (3.1% and 3.5%, respectively; both P<0.05). Findings were similar at the tibia. Increasing severity of hyperparathyroidism was associated with increased cortical losses. However, loss of trabecular bone and bone strength were most severe at the lowest and highest PTH levels. In summary, ECSW was associated with preservation of bone mineral density at the central skeleton; however, it was also associated with progressive declines in cortical and trabecular bone density at the peripheral skeleton. Cortical decreases related directly to PTH levels, whereas the relationship between PTH and trabecular bone decreases was bimodal. Studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic agents that suppress PTH will prevent cortical and trabecular losses and post-transplant fractures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Bone Density", "Bone Diseases", "Bone Remodeling", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glucocorticoids", "Graft Rejection", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Radiography", "Risk Factors", "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sapna P", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Oakland, California;"}, {"First Name": "Lucas E", "Last Name": "Nikkel", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York;"}, {"First Name": "Kyle K", "Last Name": "Nishiyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Elzbieta", "Last Name": "Dworakowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Boutroy", "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale U1033, University of Lyon, Lyon, France;"}, {"First Name": "X Sherry", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd E", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York;"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Thomas L", "Last Name": "Nickolas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and tln2001@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}, {"PMID": "24390076", "Title": "Cervical collagen network remodeling in normal pregnancy and disrupted parturition in Antxr2 deficient mice.", "Abstract": "The remodeling of the cervix from a rigid barrier into a compliant structure, which dilates to allow for delivery, is a critical process for a successful pregnancy. Changes in the mechanical properties of cervical tissue during remodeling are hypothesized to be related to the types of collagen crosslinks within the tissue. To further understand normal and abnormal cervical remodeling, we quantify the material properties and collagen crosslink density of cervical tissue throughout pregnancy from normal wild-type and Anthrax Toxin Receptor 2 knockout (Antxr2-/-) mice. Antxr2-/- females are known to have a parturition defect, in part, due to an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the cervix, particularly collagen. In this study, we determined the mechanical properties in gestation-timed cervical samples by osmotic loading and measured the density of mature collagen crosslink, pyridinoline (PYD), by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). The equilibrium material response of the tissue to loading was investigated using a hyperelastic material model where the stresses in the material are balanced by the osmotic swelling tendencies of the glycosaminoglycans and the tensile restoring forces of a randomly-oriented crosslinked collagen fiber network. This study shows that the swelling response of the cervical tissue increased with decreasing PYD density in normal remodeling. In the Antxr2-/- mice, there was no significant increase in swelling volume or significant decrease in crosslink density with advancing gestation. By comparing the ECM-mechanical response relationships in normal and disrupted parturition mouse models this study shows that a reduction of collagen crosslink density is related to cervical softening and contributes to the cervical remodeling process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Cervix Uteri", "Computer Simulation", "Elastic Modulus", "Extracellular Matrix", "Female", "Fibrillar Collagens", "Hardness", "Humans", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Biological", "Parturition", "Pregnancy", "Receptors, Peptide", "Viscosity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoko", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Reeves", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Vink", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24145526", "Title": "Evidence for pyronaridine as a highly effective partner drug for treatment of artemisinin-resistant malaria in a rodent model.", "Abstract": "The increasing prevalence in Southeast Asia of Plasmodium falciparum infections with delayed parasite clearance rates, following treatment of malaria patients with the artemisinin derivative artesunate, highlights an urgent need to identify which of the currently available artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are most suitable to treat populations with emerging artemisinin resistance. Here, we demonstrate that the rodent Plasmodium berghei SANA strain has acquired artemisinin resistance following drug pressure, as defined by reduced parasite clearance and early recrudescence following daily exposure to high doses of artesunate or the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Using the SANA strain and the parental drug-sensitive N strain, we have interrogated the antimalarial activity of five ACTs, namely, artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and the newest combination artesunate-pyronaridine. By monitoring parasitemia and outcome for 30 days following initiation of treatment, we found that infections with artemisinin-resistant P. berghei SANA parasites can be successfully treated with artesunate-pyronaridine used at doses that are curative for the parental drug-sensitive N strain. No other partner drug combination was as effective in resolving SANA infections.

In this longitudinal study of 53 patients with CKD Stages 2 to 5D, we used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), and biochemical markers of bone metabolism to elucidate effects of CKD on the skeleton. Median follow-up was 1.5 years (range 0.9 to 4.3 years); bone changes were annualized and compared with baseline. By DXA, there were significant declines in areal bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip and ultradistal radius: -1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.1 to -0.6) and -2.4% (95% CI -4.0 to -0.9), respectively. By HRpQCT at the distal radius, there were significant declines in cortical area, density, and thickness and increases in porosity: -2.9% (95% CI -3.7 to -2.2), -1.3% (95% CI -1.6 to -0.6), -2.8% (95% CI -3.6 to -1.9), and +4.2% (95% CI 2.0 to 6.4), respectively. Radius trabecular area increased significantly: +0.4% (95% CI 0.2 to 0.6), without significant changes in trabecular density or microarchitecture. Elevated time-averaged levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone turnover markers predicted cortical deterioration. Higher levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D predicted decreases in trabecular network heterogeneity. These data suggest that significant cortical loss occurs with CKD, which is mediated by hyperparathyroidism and elevated turnover.

Using three different mouse models of myeloproliferative disorders, including mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathways and two models based on expression of human leukemia disease alleles, we uncovered a mechanism by which proliferating and inflammatory myeloid cells take up and oxidize glucose during the feeding period, contributing to energy dissipation and subsequent loss of adipose mass. In vivo, lentiviral inhibition of Glut1 by shRNA prevented myeloproliferation and adipose tissue loss in mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathway in leukocytes. Thus, Glut1 was necessary to sustain proliferation and potentially divert glucose from fat storage. We also showed that overexpression of the human ApoA-I transgene to raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels decreased Glut1 expression, dampened myeloproliferation, and prevented fat loss.

Despite these findings, fracture risk at both vertebral and nonvertebral sites is increased in PHPT. Emerging technologies, such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), may provide additional insight into microstructural features at sites such as the forearm and tibia that have heretofore not been easily accessible. Using HRpQCT, we determined cortical and trabecular microstructure at the radius and tibia in 51 postmenopausal women with PHPT and 120 controls. Individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) and micro-finite element (\u00b5FE) analyses of the HRpQCT images were also performed to further understand how the abnormalities seen by HRpQCT might translate into effects on bone strength. Women with PHPT showed, at both sites, decreased volumetric densities at trabecular and cortical compartments, thinner cortices, and more widely spaced and heterogeneously distributed trabeculae. At the radius, trabeculae were thinner and fewer in PHPT. The radius was affected to a greater extent in the trabecular compartment than the tibia. ITS analyses revealed, at both sites, that plate-like trabeculae were depleted, with a resultant reduction in the plate/rod ratio. Microarchitectural abnormalities were evident by decreased plate-rod and plate-plate junctions at the radius and tibia, and rod-rod junctions at the radius. These trabecular and cortical abnormalities resulted in decreased whole-bone stiffness and trabecular stiffness. These results provide evidence that in PHPT, microstructural abnormalities are pervasive and not limited to the cortical compartment, which may help to account for increased global fracture risk in PHPT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Bone Density", "Bone and Bones", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Hyperparathyroidism, Primary", "Postmenopause", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara C", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Boutroy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Udesky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Romano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elzbieta", "Last Name": "Dworakowski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aline G", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dinaz", "Last Name": "Irani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "X Edward", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23162103", "Title": "Therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH(1-84): a prospective four-year investigation of efficacy and safety.", "Abstract": "PTH may be an effective treatment option for hypoparathyroidism, but long-term data are not available.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Calcium", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "Humans", "Hypoparathyroidism", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vitamin D"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natalie E", "Last Name": "Cusano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mishaela R", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Ives", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Tulley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Sliney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge C", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Bilezikian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "22795088", "Title": "Using changes in binding globulins to assess oral contraceptive compliance.", "Abstract": "Validity of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) clinical trial results depends on participant compliance.
