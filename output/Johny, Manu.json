The intramolecular interactions of NEDD4L regulate its enzymatic activity which is essential for proteostasis. For NaV1.5, this process is critical as alterations in Na+ current is involved in cardiac diseases including arrhythmias and heart failure. In this study, we perform extensive biochemical and functional analyses that implicate the C2 domain and the first WW-linker (1,2-linker) in the autoregulatory mechanism of NEDD4L. Through in\u00a0vitro and electrophysiological experiments, the NEDD4L 1,2-linker was determined to be important in substrate ubiquitination of NaV1.5. We establish the preferred sites of ubiquitination of NEDD4L to be in the second WW-linker (2,3-linker). Interestingly, NEDD4L ubiquitinates the cytoplasmic linker between the first and second transmembrane domains of the channel (DI-DII) of NaV1.5. Moreover, we design a genetically encoded modulator of Nav1.5 that achieves Na+ current reduction using the NEDD4L HECT domain as cargo of a NaV1.5-binding nanobody. These investigations elucidate the mechanisms regulating the NEDD4 family and furnish a new molecular framework for understanding NaV1.5 ubiquitination.", "Keywords": ["E3 ligases", "HECT", "NEDD4-2", "NEDD4L", "NanoMaN", "Nav1.5", "PTM", "SCN5A", "mass spectrometry", "nanobody", "post translational modification", "proteostasis", "transthioesterification", "ubiquitin", "voltage-gated sodium channel"], "MeSH terms": ["Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport", "Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitination", "Humans", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "HEK293 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katharine M", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Nathan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanjie", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "HyoJeon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nourdine", "Last Name": "Chakouri", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin N", "Last Name": "Nwafor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucile", "Last Name": "Fossier", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lakshmi", "Last Name": "Srinivasan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Boronina", "Affiliation": "Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Post", "Affiliation": "Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suman", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip A", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra B", "Last Name": "Gabelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution.

in 2004 and was shown to cause a severe multisystem disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS). The mutation was localized to the distal S6 region of the channel, a region known to play a major role in channel activation. TS patients suffer from life-threatening cardiac symptoms as well as significant neurodevelopmental deficits, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since this discovery, the number and variety of mutations identified in CaV1.2 have grown tremendously, and the distal S6 regions remain a frequent locus for many of these mutations. While the majority of patients harboring these mutations exhibit cardiac symptoms that can be well explained by known pathogenic mechanisms, the same cannot be said for the ASD or neurodevelopmental phenotypes seen in some patients, indicating a gap in our understanding of the pathogenesis of CaV1.2 channelopathies. Here, we use whole-cell patch clamp, quantitative Ca2+ imaging, and single channel recordings to expand the known mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CaV1.2 channelopathies.

If the fluorescently-labeled molecules are in close proximity, then photoexcitation of the donor results in non-radiative energy transfer to the acceptor, and subsequent fluorescence emission of the acceptor. The stoichiometry of ion channel interactions and their relative binding affinities can be deduced by quantifying both the FRET efficiency and the total number of donors and acceptors in a given cell. In this chapter, we discuss general considerations for FRET analysis of biological interactions, various strategies for estimating FRET efficiencies, and detailed protocols for construction of binding curves and determination of stoichiometry.

The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) serves as a de facto subunit of NaV1.5. Genetic studies and atomic structures suggest that this interaction is pathophysiologically critical, as human mutations within the NaV1.5 carboxy-terminus that disrupt CaM binding are linked to distinct forms of life-threatening arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome 3, a \"gain-of-function\" defect, and Brugada syndrome, a \"loss-of-function\" phenotype. Yet, how a common disruption in CaM binding engenders divergent effects on NaV1.5 gating is not fully understood, though vital for elucidating arrhythmogenic mechanisms and for developing new therapies. Here, using extensive single-channel analysis, we find that the disruption of Ca2+-free CaM preassociation with NaV1.5 exerts two disparate effects: 1) a decrease in the peak open probability and 2) an increase in persistent NaV openings. Mechanistically, these effects arise from a CaM-dependent switch in the NaV inactivation mechanism. Specifically, CaM-bound channels preferentially inactivate from the open state, while those devoid of CaM exhibit enhanced closed-state inactivation. Further enriching this scheme, for certain mutant NaV1.5, local Ca2+ fluctuations elicit a rapid recruitment of CaM that reverses the increase in persistent Na current, a factor that may promote beat-to-beat variability in late Na current. In all, these findings identify the elementary mechanism of CaM regulation of NaV1.5 and, in so doing, unravel a noncanonical role for CaM in tuning ion channel gating.

CDI is mediated by calmodulin (CaM), which is bound to the IQ domain of the CaV carboxy tail. This modulatory process is tailored by alternative splicing such that select splice variants of CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 contain a long distal carboxy tail (DCT). The DCT harbors an inhibitor of CDI (ICDI) module that competitively displaces CaM from the IQ domain, thereby diminishing CDI. While this overall mechanism is now well described, the detailed interactions required for ICDI binding to the IQ domain are yet to be elucidated. Here, we perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IQ and ICDI domains and evaluate the contribution of neighboring regions to CDI inhibition. Through FRET binding analysis, we identify functionally relevant residues within the CaV1.3 IQ domain and the CaV1.4 ICDI and nearby A region, which are required for high-affinity IQ/ICDI binding. Importantly, patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that disruption of this interaction commensurately diminishes ICDI function resulting in the re-emergence of CDI in mutant channels. Furthermore, CaV1.2 channels harbor a homologous DCT; however, the ICDI region of this channel does not appear to appreciably modulate CaV1.2 CDI. Yet coexpression of CaV1.2 ICDI with select CaV1.3 splice variants significantly disrupts CDI, implicating a cross-channel modulatory scheme in cells expressing both channel subtypes.

We created transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human NaV1.5 channels with alanine substitutions for the IQ motif (IQ/AA). The mutations rendered the channels incapable of binding calmodulin to the C-terminus. The IQ/AA transgenic mice exhibited normal ventricular repolarization without arrhythmias and an absence of increased late Na+ current. In comparison, transgenic mice expressing a lidocaine-resistant (F1759A) human NaV1.5 demonstrated increased late Na+ current and prolonged repolarization in cardiomyocytes, with spontaneous arrhythmias. To determine regulatory factors that prevent late Na+ current for the IQ/AA mutant channel, we considered fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), which are within the NaV1.5 proteomic subdomain shown by proximity labeling in transgenic mice expressing NaV1.5 conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase. We found that FGF13 diminished late current of the IQ/AA but not F1759A mutant cardiomyocytes, suggesting that endogenous FHFs may serve to prevent late Na+ current in mouse cardiomyocytes.

Functional studies that tethered CaM to CaV1.2 suggested that a single CaM sufficed for Ca2+ feedback, yet biochemical, FRET, and structural studies showed that multiple CaM molecules interact with distinct interfaces within channel cytosolic segments, suggesting that functional Ca2+ regulation may be more nuanced. Resolving this ambiguity is critical as CaM is enriched in subcellular domains where CaV channels reside, such as the cardiac dyad.

Functional diversity arises from two families of regulatory subunits, \u03b2 and \u03b3, which help define the range of voltages over which BK channels in a given cell are activated, thereby defining physiological roles. A BK channel can contain zero to four \u03b2 subunits per channel, with each \u03b2 subunit incrementally influencing channel gating behavior, consistent with symmetry expectations.

Here we utilize two distinct and independent methods, a Forster resonance energy transfer-based optical approach and a functional reporter in single-channel recordings, to reveal that a BK channel can contain up to four \u03b31 subunits, but a single \u03b31 subunit suffices to induce the full gating shift.

With one lobe bound, CaV carboxy tail rearranges itself, resulting in a preinhibited configuration precluded from Ca2+ feedback. Reconstitution of two lobes, even as separate molecules, relieves preinhibition and restores Ca2+ feedback. CaV channels thus detect the coincident binding of two Ca2+-free lobes to promote channel opening, a molecular implementation of a logical NOR operation that processes spatiotemporal Ca2+ signals bifurcated by CaM lobes. Overall, a unified scheme of CaV channel regulation by CaM now emerges, and our findings highlight the versatility of CaM to perform exquisite Ca2+ computations.", "Keywords": ["CaV1.3", "calcium regulation", "calmodulin", "ion channels", "voltage-gated Ca channels"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Calmodulin", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Rats", "Sequence Homology", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "Jesse B", "Last Name": "Yoder", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "David T", "Last Name": "Yue", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "L Mario", "Last Name": "Amzel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}, {"First Name": "Gordon F", "Last Name": "Tomaselli", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287."}, {"First Name": "Sandra B", "Last Name": "Gabelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205; mbj2124@cumc.columbia.edu gabelli@jhmi.edu."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205; mbj2124@cumc.columbia.edu gabelli@jhmi.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2018Mar27"}, {"PMID": "25122673", "Title": "Calcineurin determines toxic versus beneficial responses to \u03b1-synuclein.", "Abstract": "Calcineurin (CN) is a highly conserved Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphatase that senses Ca(2+) concentrations and transduces that information into cellular responses. Ca(2+) homeostasis is disrupted by \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a small lipid binding protein whose misfolding and accumulation is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. We report that \u03b1-syn, from yeast to neurons, leads to sustained highly elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), thereby activating a CaM-CN cascade that engages substrates that result in toxicity. Surprisingly, complete inhibition of CN also results in toxicity. Limiting the availability of CaM shifts CN's spectrum of substrates toward protective pathways. Modulating CN or CN's substrates with highly selective genetic and pharmacological tools (FK506) does the same. FK506 crosses the blood brain barrier, is well tolerated in humans, and is active in neurons and glia. Thus, a tunable response to CN, which has been conserved for a billion years, can be targeted to rebalance the phosphatase's activities from toxic toward beneficial substrates. These findings have immediate therapeutic implications for synucleinopathies.", "Keywords": ["Crz1", "NFAT", "Slm2", "TORC2", "neuroinflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcineurin", "Calcineurin Inhibitors", "Calcium Signaling", "Calmodulin", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Humans", "Lewy Body Disease", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Neurological", "NFATC Transcription Factors", "Neurons", "Parkinson Disease", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Rats", "Recombinant Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Tacrolimus", "alpha-Synuclein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriela", "Last Name": "Caraveo", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;"}, {"First Name": "Pavan K", "Last Name": "Auluck", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142; Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114; Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Luke", "Last Name": "Whitesell", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142;"}, {"First Name": "Chee Yeun", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142;"}, {"First Name": "Valeriya", "Last Name": "Baru", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139;"}, {"First Name": "Eugene V", "Last Name": "Mosharov", "Affiliation": "Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohui", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487;"}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205; and."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Soste", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich CH-8093, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Picotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich CH-8093, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Hanna", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487;"}, {"First Name": "Kim A", "Last Name": "Caldwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487;"}, {"First Name": "Guy A", "Last Name": "Caldwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487;"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Neurology and Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "David T", "Last Name": "Yue", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205; and."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Lindquist", "Affiliation": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; lindquist@wi.mit.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014Aug26"}]
