Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) refers to the loss of ovarian function in women before the age of 40 due to the depletion of follicles or decreased quality of remaining follicles, constituting a significant cause of female infertility. In recent years, with the help of the rapid development in genetic sequencing technology, it has been demonstrated that genetic factors play a crucial role in the onset of POI. Among the population suffering from POI, genetic studies have revealed that genes involved in processes such as meiosis, DNA damage repair, and mitosis account for approximately 37.4% of all pathogenic and potentially pathogenic genes identified. FA complementation group M (FANCM) is a group of genes involved in the damage repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), including FANCA-FANCW. Abnormalities in the FANCM genes are associated with female infertility and FANCM gene knockout mice also exhibit phenotypes similar to those of POI. During the genetic screening of POI patients, this study identified a suspicious variant in FANCM. This study aims to explore the pathogenic mechanisms of the FANCM genes of the FA pathway and their variants in the development of POI.

Traditional methods for detecting the risk of depression, predominantly reliant on psychiatric evaluations and self-assessment questionnaires, are often criticized for their inefficiency and lack of objectivity. Advancements in deep learning have paved the way for innovations in depression risk detection methods that fuse multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel framework, the Audio, Video, and Text Fusion-Three Branch Network (AVTF-TBN), designed to amalgamate auditory, visual, and textual cues for a comprehensive analysis of depression risk. Our approach encompasses three dedicated branches-Audio Branch, Video Branch, and Text Branch-each responsible for extracting salient features from the corresponding modality. These features are subsequently fused through a multimodal fusion (MMF) module, yielding a robust feature vector that feeds into a predictive modeling layer. To further our research, we devised an emotion elicitation paradigm based on two distinct tasks-reading and interviewing-implemented to gather a rich, sensor-based depression risk detection dataset. The sensory equipment, such as cameras, captures subtle facial expressions and vocal characteristics essential for our analysis. The research thoroughly investigates the data generated by varying emotional stimuli and evaluates the contribution of different tasks to emotion evocation. During the experiment, the AVTF-TBN model has the best performance when the data from the two tasks are simultaneously used for detection, where the F1 Score is 0.78, Precision is 0.76, and Recall is 0.81.

The current research focus involves targeting macrophages to remodel their phenotype as a treatment approach for inflammatory diseases. Notably, exosomes can be delivered to specific types of cells or tissues or inflammatory area to realize targeted drug delivery. Although icariin (ICA) exhibits regulatory potential in macrophage polarization, the practical application of ICA is impeded by its water insolubility, poor permeability, and low bioavailability. Exploiting the inherent advantages of exosomes as natural drug carriers, we introduce a novel drug delivery system-adipose-derived stem cells-exosomes (ADSCs-EXO)-ICA. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a loading rate of 92.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0% for ADSCs-EXO-ICA, indicating the successful incorporation of ICA. As demonstrated by cell counting kit-8 assays, ADSCs-EXO exerted a significantly higher promotion effect on macrophage proliferation. The subsequent experimental results revealed the superior anti-inflammatory effect of ADSCs-EXO-ICA compared to individual treatments with EXO or ICA in the lipopolysaccharide\u00a0+\u00a0interferon-gamma-induced M1 inflammation model. Additionally, results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analyses revealed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA effectively inhibited macrophage polarization toward the M1-type and concurrently promoted polarization toward the M2-type. The underlying mechanism involved the modulation of macrophage polarization through inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear transcription factor-kappa B signaling pathway, thereby mitigating inflammation. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of ADSCs-EXO-ICA as a novel intervention for inflammatory diseases.", "Keywords": ["Anti-inflammatory", "Exosomes", "Human adipose-derived stem cells", "Icariin", "Macrophage polarization"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qiqi", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory for Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

The main findings of this study are described below. First, both real and sham groups could increase their FAA during training, but only the real group showed a significant increase in FAA at rest. Second, the predictors during training blocks and at rests were different: L1 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (clustering coefficient and local efficiency) of the right hemispheric gray matter and functional networks, while L2 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (local and global efficiency) of the whole-brain and left the hemispheric functional network.

However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography (EEG) alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTW) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45\u00b0/-45\u00b0 phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within-subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45\u00b0 phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves (BTW), along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45\u00b0/-45\u00b0 phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.Significance Statement Visual contrast detection, despite consistent stimuli, frequently exhibits variability.

Recent findings demonstrated that incorporating HEAs into sulfur cathodes can alleviate the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and accelerate their redox reactions. Herein, we synthesized nano Pt0.25Cu0.25Fe0.15Co0.15Ni0.2 HEAs on hollow carbons (HCs; denoted as HEA/HC) by a facile pyrolysis strategy. The HEA/HC nanostructures were further integrated into hypha carbon nanobelts (HCNBs). The solid-solution phase formed by the uniform mixture of the five metal elements, i.e., Pt0.25Cu0.25Fe0.15Co0.15Ni0.2 HEAs, gave rise to a strong interaction between neighboring atoms in different metals, resulting in their adsorption energy transformation across a wide, multipeak, and nearly continuous spectrum. Meanwhile, the HEAs exhibited numerous active sites on their surface, which is beneficial to catalyzing the cascade conversion of LiPSs. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with detailed experimental investigations, the prepared HEAs bidirectionally catalyze the cascade reactions of LiPSs and boost their conversion reaction rates. S/HEA@HC/HCNB cathodes achieved a low 0.034% decay rate for 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. Notably, the S/HEA@HC/HCNB cathode delivered a high initial areal capacity of 10.2 mAh cm-2 with a sulfur loading of 9 mg cm-2 at 0.1 C. The assembled pouch cell exhibited a capacity of 1077.9 mAh g-1 at the first discharge at 0.1 C. The capacity declined to 71.3% after 43 cycles at 0.1 C. In this work, we propose to utilize HEAs as catalysts not only to improve the cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries, but also to promote HEAs in energy storage applications.", "Keywords": ["Bidirectional electrocatalysts", "Cathode", "High-entropy alloys", "Liquid\u2212solid conversion", "Lithium\u2212sulfur battery"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fengfeng", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhilong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology, Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200240, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Liwen", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Kehao", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology, Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200240, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology, Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200240, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Hui-Qing", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jinjin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology, Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200240, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xitian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Lili", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150025, People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "ACS nano", "PubDate": "2024Jun11"}, {"PMID": "38795484", "Title": "Metagenomic Insights into Potential Impacts of Antibacterial Biosynthesis and Anthropogenic Activity on Nationwide Soil Resistome.", "Abstract": "The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils has received extensive attention regarding its impacts on environmental, animal, and human systems under One Health.

We previously found that exposure to toxic metals in the blood raised the risk of PCOS, but the association between exposure to toxic metals and the risk of PCOS in the follicular fluid, the microenvironment for oocyte growth and development in females, and its effect on metabolism has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the concentrations of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), barium (Ba) and arsenic (As) in FF and the risk of PCOS, and to explore the mediating effect of metabolic markers in FF on the above relationship. We conducted\u00a0a case-control study, including 557 women with PCOS and 651 controls. Ba, Cd, Hg and As levels in FF were measured by ICP-MS, metabolites levels in FF was measured by LC-MS/MS among 168 participants randomly selected from all the participants. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of a single metal level with the PCOS risk, and linear regression models were used to assess the relationships of a single metal level with clinical phenotype parameters and metabolites levels. Combined effect of metals mixture levels on the risk of PCOS were assessed via weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Medication analysis was performed to explore the role of metabolic markers on the relationship of toxic metals levels with the risk of PCOS. The exposure levels of Cd, Hg, Ba and As in FF were all positively and significantly associated with the PCOS risk (with respect to the highest vs. lowest tertile group: OR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.17\u2009~\u20092.12 for Cd, OR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.22\u2009~\u20092.34 for Hg, OR\u2009=\u20091.76, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009~\u20092.34 for Ba, OR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05\u2009~\u20091.91 for As). In addition, levels of metal mixture also significantly correlated with the risk of PCOS, Cd level contributed most to it. Moreover, we observed significant positive relationships between Cd level and LH (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.048, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.002\u2009~\u20090.094), T (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.077, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.029\u2009~\u20090.125) and HOMA-IR value (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.060, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.012\u2009~\u20090.107), as well as Hg level with LH, FSH/LH ratio and TC. Furthermore, we revealed that estrone sulfate, LysoPE 22:6 and N-Undecanoylglycine were significantly and positively mediating the association between Cd level and the risk of PCOS (with mediated proportion of 0.39, 0.24 and 0.35, respectively), and between Hg level and the risk of PCOS (with mediated proportion of 0.29, 0.20 and 0.46, respectively). These highly expressed metabolites significantly enriched in the fatty acid oxidation, steroid hormone biosynthesis and glycerophospholipids metabolism, which may explain the reason why the levels of Cd and Hg in FF associated with the phenotype of PCOS. Ba and As in FF was not found the above phenomenon. Our results suggested that exposure to multiple toxic metals (Cd, Hg, Ba and As) in FF associated with the increased risk of PCOS, Cd was a major contributor. Levels of Cd and Hg in FF significantly associated with the phenotype of PCOS. The above association may result from that Cd and Hg in FF related with the disturbance of fatty acid oxidation, steroid hormone biosynthesis and the glycerophospholipids metabolism.", "Keywords":

Using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% phosphoric acid and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 98:2, the detection was performed at a wavelength of 210 nm for 15 min. In addition, a cluster analysis was performed on the detected LMWOAs in the reclaimed soil. The correlations between the LMWOA and nutrient contents in the reclaimed soil were also analyzed. In total, eight and seven LMWOAs were detected in the reclaimed soil and filled fly ash, respectively. In contrast, no LMWOAs were detected in the fresh fly ash from a thermal power plant. The order of total LMWOA contents at different sampling points followed the order of farmland control soil > 1# (Triticum aestivum) > 4# (Phragmites australis) > 5# (Vigna radiata) > 2# (Sorghum bicolor) > 3# (Tamarix ramosissima) > fly ash-filled soil. The farmland control soil and fly ash-filled soil exhibited the highest and lowest LMWOA contents of 648.22 and 85.09 \u03bcg\u00b7g-1, respectively. The LMWOA contents in the reclaimed soil followed the order of oxalic acid > tartaric acid > malonic acid > lactic acid > acetic acid > citric acid > propionic acid > succinic acid.

Although certain key genes associated with rice grain size and weight have been successfully cloned, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain size and weight regulation remain elusive.

OsSTK38 is a nuclear Dbf2-related kinase that positively regulates grain size and weight by coordinating cell proliferation and expansion in the spikelet hull. OsMOB1A interacts with and enhances the autophosphorylation of OsSTK38. Specifically, the critical role of the OsSTK38 S322 site in its kinase activity is highlighted.

The three differently sized activated ZUL-520 (denoted as ZUL-520a) exhibited almost identical C2H2 uptake of 4.8 mmol/g at 100 kPa, while the C2H2 uptake at 1 kPa increased with a downsizing crystal. The C2H2 uptake of activated ZUL-520-2 (denoted as ZUL-520-2a) at 1 kPa was \u223c55% higher than that of activated ZUL-520-0 (denoted as ZUL-520-0a). The adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics validated that gas adsorptive separation is governed not only by adsorption thermodynamics but also by adsorption kinetics. In addition, all three different-sized ZUL-520a MOFs showed high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) computations illustrated a plausible mechanism of C2H2 adsorption in MOFs. Importantly, breakthrough experiments demonstrated that ZUL-520a can effectively separate the C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture and the C2H4 productivity obtained by ZUL-520-2a was much higher than that by ZUL-520-0a.

To elucidate how assembly of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with Mediator complex preinitiation complexes (PICs) and formation of transcription-permissive 3D chromatin organization are coordinated, we studied MED1, a representative subunit of the Mediator complex that acts to establish functional preinitiation complexes (PICs) that forms biomolecular condensates through an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to facilitate transcription, and is implicated in the function of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (hereafter ER) in ER-positive breast cancer (ER+ BC) cells. We found that MED1 is acetylated at 6 lysines in its IDR and, further, that MCF7 ER+ BC cells in which endogenous MED1 is replaced by an ectopic 6KR (non-acetylatable) mutant (6KR cells) exhibit enhanced cell growth and elevated expression of MED1-dependent genes. These results indicate an enhanced function of 6KR MED1 that may be attributed to two mechanisms: (1) reorganized PIC assembly, as indicated by increased MED1 and Pol II, decreased MED17, and equivalent ER\u03b1 occupancies on chromatin, particularly at active enhancers and promoters; (2) sub-TAD chromatin unfolding, as revealed by HiCAR (Hi-C on accessible regulatory DNA) analyses. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrate distinct physio-chemical properties of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) for 6KR versus 6KQ MED1 IDRs, and for non-acetylated versus CBP-acetylated WT MED1 IDR fragments. Related, Pol II CTD heptads are sequestered in 6KR and control WT MED1 IDR condensates, but not 6KQ and CBP-acetylated WT MED1 IDR condensates. These findings, in conjunction with recent reports of PIC structures, indicate that MED1 coordinates reorganization of the PIC machinery and the rewiring of regional chromatin organization through acetylation of its IDR.

They also play an important function in mediating the interactions of microbial producers with their living environment and surrounding organisms. However, little is known about the genetic novelty, distribution, and community-level impacts of soil bacterial biosynthetic potential on a large geographic scale. Here, we constructed the first catalog of 11,149 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from agricultural soils across China and unearthed hidden biosynthetic potential for new natural product discovery from the not-yet-cultivated soil bacteria. Notably, we revealed soil pH as the strongest environmental driver of BGC biogeography and predicted that soil acidification and global climate change could damage the biosynthetic potential of the soil microbiome. The co-occurrence network of bacterial genomes revealed two BGC-rich species, i.e., Nocardia niigatensis from Actinobacteriota and PSRF01 from Acidobacteriota, as the module hub and connector, respectively, indicating their keystone positions in the soil microbial communities. We also uncovered a dominant role of BGC-inferred biotic interactions over environmental drivers in structuring the soil microbiome. Overall, this study achieved novel insights into the BGC landscape in agricultural soils of China, substantially expanding our understanding of the diversity and novelty of bacterial secondary metabolism and the potential role of secondary metabolites in microbiota assembly.IMPORTANCEBacterial secondary metabolites not only serve as the foundation for numerous therapeutics (e.g., antibiotics and anticancer drugs), but they also play critical ecological roles in mediating microbial interactions (e.g., competition and communication). However, our knowledge of bacterial secondary metabolism is limited to only a small fraction of cultured strains, thus restricting our comprehensive understanding of their diversity, novelty, and potential ecological roles in soil ecosystems. Here, we used culture-independent metagenomics to explore biosynthetic potentials in agricultural soils of China. Our analyses revealed a high degree of genetic diversity and novelty within biosynthetic gene clusters in agricultural soil environments, offering valuable insights for biochemists seeking to synthesize novel bioactive products. Furthermore, we uncovered the pivotal role of BGC-rich species in microbial communities and the significant relationship between BGC richness and microbial phylogenetic turnover.

This novel reaction is enabled by photoactivation of an electron donor-acceptor complex, in which THF serves as both the solvent and electron donor. DFT studies indicated that the oxidation process involves a concerted hydrogen abstraction transfer from THF and dehydroxylation of boronic acid undergoing spin crossover from triplet to singlet to produce an active peroxoboronic acid intermidiate. Salient merits of this chemistry include broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, gram-scale synthesis, and versatile late-stage functionalizations as well as the use of air, visible light, and catalyst- and additive-free conditions. This strategy introduces a novel photoreaction mode with the aid of a solvent, offering a succinct and environmentally sustainable route for synthesizing phenols.

This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Despite their merits, the optimization of their chemical structure for further enhancing of device performance remains challenge. Different from previous reports utilizing p-type linkers, here, we explore an n-type linker, specifically the benzothiadiazole unit, to dimerize the SMA units via a click-like Knoevenagel condensation, affording BT-DL. In comparison with B-DL with a benzene linkage, BT-DL exhibits significantly stronger intramolecular super-exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore, BT-DL demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of BT-DL translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49\u2009% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17\u2009% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with B-DL as the acceptor. Notably, the BT-DL based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90\u2009% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000\u2005hours of thermal stress at 90\u2009\u00b0C.

To address this challenge, researchers have turned to deep neural networks, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have shown success in image recognition due to their different levels of features enabling high performance. In this study, we used pre-trained VGG-16, a popular CNN model, to analyze video data and extract hierarchical features from low-level shallow layers to high-level deeper layers, linking these activations to different levels of activation of the human brain. We hypothesized that activations in different layers of VGG-16 would be associated with different levels of brain activation and visual processing hierarchy in the brain. We were also curious about which brain regions would be associated with deeper convolutional layers in VGG-16. The study analyzed a functional MRI (fMRI) dataset where participants watched the cartoon movie Partly Cloudy. Frames of the videos were fed into VGG-16, and activation maps from different kernels and layers were extracted. Time series of the average activation patterns for each kernel were created and fed into a voxel-wise model to study brain activations. Results showed that lower convolutional layers (1st convolutional layer) were mostly associated with lower visual regions, but some kernels (6, 19, 24, 42, 55, and 58) surprisingly showed associations with activations in the posterior cingulate cortex, part of the default mode network. Deeper convolutional layers were associated with more anterior and lateral portions of the visual cortex (e.g., the lateral occipital complex) and the supramarginal gyrus. Analyzing activation features associated with different brain regions showed the promise and limitations of using CNNs to link video content to brain functions.", "Keywords": ["Convolutional neural network", "Default mode network", "Lateral occipital complex", "Naturalistic condition", "Supramarginal gyrus", "Visual cortex"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wonbum", "Last Name": "Sohn", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Di", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, 518060."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Bharat B", "Last Name": "Biswal", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07029, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan22"}, {"PMID": "38318728", "Title": "Tethered Trimeric Small-molecular Acceptors through Aromatic-core Engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells.", "Abstract": "Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA-subunits are connected to the aromatic-core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene-carboxylate core and find that meta-positioned dimeric BDY-\u03b2 exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para-positioned counterpart, BDY-\u03b1. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY-\u03b2, maintaining a meta-position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic-core engineering results in a star-shaped C3h-positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red-shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24\u2009%, coupled with a remarkable short-circuit current density of 27.06\u2005mA\u2009cm-2. More significantly, the trimer-based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95\u2009% of their initial efficiency after 1200\u2005h thermal degradation.

Heightened WM load was associated with increased flexibility of the frontoparietal networks, but the cognitive decline was correlated with reduced capacity for neuroplastic changes in response to increased task demands. These findings advance our understanding of aberrant brain reconfiguration linked to cognitive decline, potentially aiding early identification of at-risk individuals.", "Keywords": ["aging", "cognitive decline", "dynamic brain state", "fMRI", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "Memory, Short-Term", "Brain", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Brain Mapping", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, International Health Science Innovation Center, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen University, 1066 Xueyuan Avenue, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Zaili", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, International Health Science Innovation Center, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen University, 1066 Xueyuan Avenue, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, International Health Science Innovation Center, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen University, 1066 Xueyuan Avenue, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT Campus of University Town of Shenzhen, NanShan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Honghai", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT Campus of University Town of Shenzhen, NanShan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Donghui", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Shenzhen Mental Health Center/Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, 1080 Cuizhu Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen, 518003, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Shenzhen Mental Health Center/Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, 1080 Cuizhu Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen, 518003, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT Campus of University Town of Shenzhen, NanShan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China."}], "Journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "PubDate": "2024Jan31"}, {"PMID": "38241379", "Title": "Temperature-dependent molecular sieving of fluorinated propane/propylene mixtures by a flexible-robust metal-organic framework.", "Abstract": "The electronics industry necessitates highly selective adsorption separation of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) from perfluoropropane (C3F8), which poses a challenge due to their similar physiochemical properties.

Remarkably, the temperature-dependent adsorption behavior enhances the discrimination between the larger C3F8 and the smaller C3F6, resulting in unprecedented C3F6/C3F8 selectivity (over 10,000) compared to other well-known porous materials at an optimal temperature (298 K). Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that high-purity C3F8 (over 99.999%) could be obtained from a C3F6/C3F8 (10:90) mixture under ambient conditions. The unique attributes of this material encompass exceptional adsorption selectivity, remarkable structural stability, and outstanding separation performance, positioning it as a highly promising candidate for C3F6/C3F8 separation.

However, the associations between Cr, Fe, Cu, Se or Co levels and iOAT risk have not been determined. This research aimed to assess the associations between Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co levels as well as their mixtures in seminal plasma and the risk of iOAT and severe iOAT. Therefore, a case\u2012control study including 823 participants (416 iOAT patients and 407 controls) recruited from October 2021 to August 2022\u00a0at the reproductive medicine center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University was conducted in Anhui, China. The concentrations of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co in seminal plasma were detected via inductively coupled plasma\u2012mass spectrometry. Binary logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the levels of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co and the risk of iOAT and severe iOAT; additionally, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions were performed to evaluate the joint effect of seminal plasma levels of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co on the risk of iOAT and explore which elements contributed most to the relationship. We found significant associations between the concentrations of Fe, Cu and Se in seminal plasma and iOAT risk after adjusting for covariates (Fe, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.86, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.31, 2.64; Cu, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.95, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.37, 2.76; Se, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.65, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.17, 2.35). A lower Se concentration in seminal plasma (lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.84, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10, 3.10) was positively associated with the risk of severe iOAT. Additionally, we also observed an association between the concentration of Cr in seminal plasma and the risk of iOAT before adjusting for covariates (Cr, third tertile vs. lowest tertile: OR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.02). According to the BKMR analyses, the risk of iOAT increased when the overall concentrations were less than the 25th percentile. The results from the WQS regression indicated that a negative WQS index was significantly associated with the iOAT risk, while a positive WQS index was not. Se and Fe had significant weights in the negative direction. In conclusion, lower Cu, Fe and Se levels in seminal plasma were positively associated with iOAT risk, while higher Cr levels in seminal plasma were positively associated with iOAT risk according to the single element model, and lower levels of Se were related to a greater risk of severe iOAT; when comprehensively considering all the results from BKMR and WQS regression, Fe, Se and Cr levels contributed most to this relationship.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian kernel machine regression", "Essential trace elements", "Oligoastenoteratozoospermia", "Sperm quality", "Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Semen", "Bayes Theorem", "Case-Control Studies", "Metals", "Logistic Models"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218 Jixi Road, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, China;

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated potential in addressing this challenge through the precision tailoring of pore sizes and surface chemistry. However, introducing modifications at the molecular level remains a considerable hurdle. This work presents an approach to reversibly tune the propylene/propane adsorption preference in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) by manipulating the particle size and gas flow rate. Systematically increasing the ZIF-8 crystals from 9 to 224 \u03bcm restricts propane diffusion, thereby reversing its preferential adsorption over propylene. Furthermore, raising the gas flow rate of mixed propylene/propane shifts the rate-determining breakthrough step from thermodynamic equilibrium to kinetics, again reversing the adsorption preference in a particular ZIF-8 sample. We propose \"dynamic selectivity (Sd(t))\" as a concept that incorporates both thermodynamic and kinetic factors to elucidate these unexpected findings. Moreover, the driving force equation, grounded on the concept of Sd(t), has improved the precision and stability of the computational simulation for fixed-bed adsorption processes. This work underscores the potential of diffusion-based modulation, implemented through manageable external changes, as a viable strategy to optimize separation performance in porous adsorbent materials.", "Keywords": ["Adsorption", "Kinetic separations", "Metal\u2212organic frameworks", "Propane", "Propylene", "ZIF-8"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linghe", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, P.R.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms is not known. In this study, we identified Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP, a key regulatory protein of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex) as a key regulator of heart function and cardiac diseases. WTAP is associated with heart development, and its expression is downregulated in both human and mice with heart failure. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Wtap (Wtap-CKO) induces dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure and neonatal death. Although WTAP deficiency in the heart decreases METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) protein levels, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Mettl3 in Wtap-CKO mice does not rescue the phenotypes of Wtap-CKO mice. Instead, WTAP deficiency in the heart decreases chromatin accessibility in the promoter regions of Mef2a (myocyte enhancer factor-2\u03b1) and Mef2c, leading to reduced mRNA and protein levels of these genes and lower expression of their target genes. Conversely, WTAP directly binds to the promoter of the Mef2c gene and increases its promoter luciferase activity and expression.

This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li+ migration. In addition, the presence of synthesis-induced heterogeneous phases and lattice defects cannot be disregarded as they also contribute to the degradation in performance. Therefore, gaining a profound understanding of the intricate relationship among material synthesis, structure, and performance is imperative for the development of LiTMO2. This paper highlights the pivotal role of structural play in LiTMO2 materials and provides a comprehensive overview of how various control factors influence the specific pathways of structural evolution during the synthesis process.

Strengthening the hetero-molecular interactions by monomer modification greatly influences the morphology and thus the device performance, but lacks investigation. Herein, two novel quinoxaline core-based G-Dimers, Dimer-QX and Dimer-2CF, are synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl-substituted Dimer-2CF and non-substituted Dimer-QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G-Dimer is investigated and revealed. The trifluoromethyl with strong electronegativity increases electrostatic potential and reduces surface energy of the G-Dimer, weakening the homo-molecular ordered packing but reinforcing the hetero-molecular interaction with the donor. The strong hetero-molecular interaction suppresses the fast assembly during the film formation, facilitating small domains with ordered molecular packing in the blend, which is a trade-off in conventional morphology control. Together with favorable vertical phase separation, efficient charge generation, and reduced bimolecular recombination are concurrently obtained. Hence, the Dimer-2CF-based OSCs obtain a cutting-edge efficiency of 19.02% with fill factor surpassing 80%, and an averaged extrapolated T80 of \u224812\u00a0000\u00a0h under continuous 80 \u00b0C heating.

To address these challenges, incorporating electrocatalysts into sulfur host materials represents an effective strategy for promoting polysulfide conversion, in tandem with the rational design of multifunctional sulfur host materials. In this study, Pt nanoparticles are integrated into biomass-derived carbon materials by solution deposition method. Pt, as an electrocatalyst, not only enhances the electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes and effectively immobilizes LiPSs but also catalyzes the redox reactions of sulfur species bidirectionally. Additionally, Pt helps regulate the 3D deposition and growth of Li2S while reducing the reaction energy barrier. Consequently, this accelerates the conversion of LiPSs in LSBs. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of Pt for the redox reactions of sulfur species, along with its influence on the 3D deposition and growth of Li2S, is elucidated using electrochemical kinetic analyses and classical models of electrochemical deposition. The cathodes exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1019.1\u00a0mAh\u00a0g-1 at 1\u00a0C and a low decay rate of 0.045% over 1500 cycles.

However, it has been observed that YOLOv4 faces challenges in accurately detecting small objects. Its bounding box regression strategy is rigid and fails to effectively leverage the asymmetric characteristics of objects, limiting its ability to enhance object detection accuracy. This paper proposes an enhanced version of YOLOv4 called KR-AL-YOLO (keypoint regression strategy and angle loss based YOLOv4). The KR-AL-YOLO approach introduces two customized modules: an keypoint regression strategy and an angle-loss function. These modules contribute to improving the algorithm's detection accuracy by enabling more precise localization of objects. Additionally, KR-AL-YOLO adopts an improved feature fusion technique, which facilitates enhanced information flow within the network, thereby further enhancing accuracy performance.

However, a multidimensional model integrating these factors is lacking due to their complex interactions. To address this, we measured pain sensitivity (ie, pain threshold and pain tolerance) using the cold pressor test, collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and genetic data, and evaluated psychological factors (ie, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and pain-related anxiety) from 450 healthy participants with both sexes (160 male, 290 female). Using multimodal MRI fusion methods, we identified 2 pairs of covarying structural and functional brain patterns associated with pain threshold and tolerance, respectively. These patterns primarily involved regions related to self-awareness, sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative, motion preparation and execution, and emotional aspects of pain. Notably, pain catastrophizing was negatively correlated with pain tolerance, and this relationship was mediated by the multimodal covarying brain patterns in male participants only. Furthermore, we identified an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4141964 within the fatty acid amide hydrolase gene and pain threshold, mediated by the identified multimodal covarying brain patterns across all participants.

Here we perform detailed experiments on HNCO photodissociation, acquiring the state-specific correlations of the NH (a1\u0394) and CO (X1\u03a3+) products. The experiments reveal a trimodal CO rotational distribution. Dynamics simulations based on a full-dimensional machine-learning-based PES of HNCO unveil three dissociation pathways exclusively occurring on the S1 excited electronic state. One pathway, following the minimum energy path (MEP) via the transition state, contributes to mild rotational excitation in CO, while the other two pathways deviating substantially from the MEP account for relatively cold and hot CO rotational state populations. These peculiar dynamics are unambiguously governed by the S1 state PES topography, i.e., a narrow acceptance cone in the vicinity of the transition state region.

Furthermore, the \u03b1-helix content in TMPs-In particles at pH\u00a03.0 decreased from 41.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.09\u00a0% (TMPs control) to 16.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.87\u00a0%. This decrement of an up to 60\u00a0% led to decreased intramolecular hydrogen bonds and improved surface hydrophobicity. Therefore, a single polysaccharide (In) combined with MPs/TMPs particles exhibited higher dispersion and stability at pH\u00a03.0. These findings could provide new insights into chicken-derived protein beverage processing.", "Keywords": ["Improvable stability", "Meat proteins", "Polysaccharides", "Thermal denaturation", "pH"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Inulin", "Alginates", "Chickens", "Proteins", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mengman", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science & Engineering, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science & Engineering, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science & Engineering, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Ji'nan 250353, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "National Center of Meat Quality and Safety Control, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China; National R&D Branch Center for Poultry Meat Processing Technology, Nanjing Huangjiaoshou Food Sci. & Tech.

Traditional small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) in the BHJ blend show thermodynamic instability affecting the morphology. In contrast, tethered SMAs exhibit higher glass transition temperatures, mitigating these concerns. Yet, they might not integrate well with polymer donors, causing pronounced phase separation and overpurification of mixed domains. Herein, a novel ternary device is introduced that uses DY-P2EH, a tethered dimeric SMA with conjugated side-chains as host acceptor, and BTP-ec9, a monomeric SMA as secondary acceptor, which respectively possess hypomiscibility and hypermiscibility with the polymer donor PM6. This unique combination affords a parallel-connected ternary BHJ blend, leading to a hierarchical and stable morphology. The ternary device achieves a remarkable fill factor of 80.61% and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.09%. Furthermore, the ternary device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 85% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1100 h of thermal stress at 85\u00a0\u00b0C. These findings highlight the potential advantage of tethered SMAs in the design of ternary devices with a refined hierarchical structure for more efficient and durable solar energy conversion technologies.", "Keywords": ["durable device", "hierarchical morphologies", "high efficiency", "ternary polymer solar cells", "tethered small-molecule acceptors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Bowen", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Biomolecular and organic electronics, Chemistry and Biology (IFM), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, SE-58183, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Shangyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinpeng", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710072, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Liangrong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Haiqiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center for the Synthesis and Applications of Waterborne Polymers, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiangang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710072, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Biomolecular and organic electronics, Chemistry and Biology (IFM), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, SE-58183, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Guo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "Journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "37788949", "Title": "Effect of genetically determined BCAA levels on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors: A Mendelian randomization study.", "Abstract": "Observational studies have demonstrated that serum branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with the risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their risk factors.

Triclosan (TCS) has a high potential to contact with NPs because of their prevalence in natural waters. Herein, this study investigated the adsorption behavior of TCS on differently sized and functionalized polystyrene (PS) NPs. The effects of environmental factors such as pH, salinity, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were also evaluated. Results suggest that the adsorption equilibrium constant (kd) of TCS in pristine PSNP suspensions followed the order as: PSNPs-50\u00a0nm (4.39\u00a0L\u00b7g-1)\u00a0>\u00a0PSNPs-100\u00a0nm (2.78\u00a0L\u00b7g-1)\u00a0>\u00a0PSNPs-200\u00a0nm (2.59\u00a0L\u00b7g-1)\u00a0>\u00a0PSNPs-500\u00a0nm (1.36\u00a0L\u00b7g-1)\u00a0\u2248\u00a0PSNPs-900\u00a0nm (1.36\u00a0L\u00b7g-1). For the functionalized PSNPs (i.e., PSNPs-COOH, PSNPs-NH2), the values of specific surface area normalized kd called kd, SSA were higher than those of pristine PSNPs. Meanwhile, TCS adsorption on two functionalized PSNPs remained stable and then decreased as salinity increased, while an opposite trend was observed toward pristine PSNPs. All these suggested that physicochemical properties of PSNPs (e.g., particle size and surface functional groups) are important factors influencing their adsorption capacity. When the solution pH raised, the adsorbed amounts of TCS on all tested PSNPs prone to decline. However, DOM only affected the adsorption behavior of PSNPs-50\u00a0nm, probably owing to its aggregation with tiny PSNPs and the induced secondary adsorption.", "Keywords": ["Adsorption", "External factor", "Functionalization", "Nanoplastics", "Size", "Triclosan"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunzhao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Institute of Environment and Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenxi", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, Beijing Laboratory of Environmental Frontier Technologies, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, Beijing Laboratory of Environmental Frontier Technologies, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Institute of Environment and Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China."}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Institute of Environment and Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China; School of Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, Beijing Laboratory of Environmental Frontier Technologies, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Telomere length (TL) is typically regulated by telomerase, the main component of which is telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of relative TL (RTL) and TERT expression in granulosa cells (GCs) during aging and its association with reproduction. Clinical data on the frozen\u2011thawed embryo transfer cycles of older (>35\u00a0year old) and younger (\u226435\u00a0year old) women from a single center over a 3\u2011year period were retrospectively analyzed. Preimplantation genetic testing for chromosome aneuploidies in older women during the same period was also analyzed. Following the analysis of the data, several biological characteristics of senescent GCs were explored. In addition, a total of 160\u00a0women who were undergoing their \ufb01rst fresh cycle of in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection were included in the study. GCs were collected from all participants. The changes of RTL and TERT expression in GCs during aging were investigated using quantitative PCR and western blotting. The associations of RTL and TERT with IVF outcomes were also assessed. The clinical data demonstrated that the pregnancy and live birth rates of women aged >35\u00a0years were ~20% lower than those of women aged \u226435\u00a0years, and the number of embryos with aneuploidy was 7\u2011fold of that without euploidy in the older age group. An aging\u2011induced change in follicle stimulating hormone receptor expression was observed. A shorter TL and increased TERT expression were detected in the older women. A significant inverse correlation between the expression levels of TERT and oocyte yield was identified. However, no association of RTL and TERT with blastocyst formation rate and the probability of clinical pregnancy was detected. It may be concluded that RTL and TERT alterations in GCs are potential determinants of ovarian aging. TERT expression in GCs appears to be a potential biomarker for the prediction of ovarian response, which provides a novel strategy for the assessment of female fertility.", "Keywords": ["aging", "granulosa cells", "in\u00a0vitro fertilization", "relative telomere length", "telomerase reverse transcriptase"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Aging", "Aneuploidy", "Fertilization in Vitro", "Granulosa Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Semen", "Telomerase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230022, P.R.

It is present in the nucleus of eukaryotes and can be actively secreted or passively released by kinds of cells. HMGB1 is important for maintaining DNA structure by binding to DNA and histones, protecting it from damage. It also regulates the interaction between histones and DNA, affecting chromatin packaging, and can influence gene expression by promoting nucleosome sliding. And as a DAMP, HMGB1 binding to RAGE and TLRs activates NF-\u03baB, which triggers the expression of downstream genes like IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. HMGB1 is known to be involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated the significance of HMGB1 as DAMPs in the female reproductive system. These findings have shed light on the potential role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of diseases in female reproductive system and the possibilities of HMGB1-targeted therapies for treating them.

from C2H2/CO2 mixtures is an essential process to produce high-purity C2H2. Fabricating an adsorbent capable of discriminating these species, which have close kinetic diameters, is critical for developing advanced adsorption processes. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to exploit the tunability of interlayer and intralayer spaces of two-dimensional (2D) layered metal-organic frameworks to achieve high performance for C2H2/CO2 separation. This indicates that interlayer symmetrical control can achieve more efficient packing of C2H2 into Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4, with a high C2H2 capacity of 45.7 cm3\u00b7g-1 at 0.01 bar and a selectivity of 67.7 (298 K, 1 bar), which strikes a good balance between working capacity and separation selectivity compared to other isostructural Ni(4-DPDS)2MO4 (M = Mo, W). Crystallographic studies and DFT-D calculations reveal that such a C2H2-selective adsorbent possesses strong binding interactions due to the tailored pore confinement provided by the angular anions and rich electronic environment.

Here, the correct way to determine KSV by oxygen-varying correlated fluorescence was systematically studied in detail. We selected gadolinium protoporphyrin IX (Gd-PpIX) to establish a fluorescence and phosphorescence dual emission system. Then, KSV of Gd-PpIX can be obtained by the change of fluorescence intensity (IF) with oxygen concentration using the method of correlated fluorescence at intense pump power; meanwhile, the value can also be determined from the relationship of the phosphorescence intensity ratio and oxygen content by the Stern-Volmer equation under relatively low power density. It was found that the KSV values obtained by the above two methods were 12.2(1) and 11.9(7) kPa-1, respectively.

While the adsorption-based separation of these atomic gases represents an energy-efficient process, achieving highly selective adsorbents remains a difficult task. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular assembly of coordination polymers, termed as M(II)-dhbq (M = Mg, Mn, Co, and Zn; dhbq = 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone), with high-density open metal sites (5.3 nm-3) and optimal pore size (5.5 \u00c5), which are able to selectively capture Xe among other chemically inert gases including Kr, Ar, N2, and O2. Among M(II)-dhbq materials, Mn-dhbq exhibits the highest Xe uptake capacity of 3.1 mmol/g and a Xe/Kr selectivity of 11.2 at 298 K and 1.0 bar, outperforming many state-of-the-art adsorbents reported so far. Remarkably, the adsorption selectivity of Mn-dhbq for Xe/O2, Xe/N2, and Xe/Ar at ambient conditions reaches as high as 70.0, 139.3, and 64.0, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments further confirm that all M(II)-dhbq materials can efficiently discriminate Xe atoms from other inert gases. It is revealed from the density functional theory calculations that the strong affinity between Xe and the coordination polymer is mainly attributed to the polarization by open metal sites.", "Keywords": ["adsorptive separation", "coordination polymer", "krypton", "open metal sites", "xenon"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liangying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, P.

Recently, nonfullerene acceptor (NFA)-based OPVs have shown excellent compatibility to device structures with large domains in active layers. However, it remains elusive how the excitations that are distant from the interfaces are converted into free charges. Here, we report the identification of a new charge separation channel in model copolymer/NFA blends mediated by intra-moiety delocalized excitations in both planar heterojunctions and donor-enriched bulk heterojunctions. The delocalized excitations induced by interchromophore electronic interactions in copolymer donors mediate the long-range charge separation and dissociate into free charges without forming the bound xCT states first, releasing the constraints associated with the short exciton diffusion length in organic materials.

Many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors participate in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway and are critical for plant architecture morphogenesis in rice. However, the number of identified bHLH genes suitable for improving production value is still limited. In this study, we cloned Lam1, encoding the typical bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH92. OsbHLH92 knockout (KO) lines exhibit erect leaves. Decreases in the number and size of parenchyma cell layers on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in KO lines were the main reason for the decreased leaf angle. Genetic experiments verify that OsBU1 and its homologs are downstream of OsbHLH92, which is involved in the noncanonical RGA1-mediated BR signaling pathway. OsbHLH91, an OsbHLH92 homolog, plays both conserved and differentiated roles relative to OsbHLH92. Notably, OsbHLH92-KO lines show erect leaves without the acquisition of adverse agronomic traits. Moreover, by driving a specific panicle promoter, OsbHLH92 can greatly increase productivity by at least 10%.

Further, because the 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 levels of Er3+ are thermally coupled, a new idea of ratiometric thermometry is proposed based on the ratio of (I800 nm)2 and I551 nm, which has the advantages of anti-interference of excitation light source fluctuation and background-free detection. The feasibility of the idea was verified by researching the power-dependent emission spectra at different temperatures and temperature-dependent emission spectra of a CaWO4:Er3+,Yb3+ sample under 980-nm laser excitation. The maximum relative sensitivity for the new ratiometric thermometry reaches up to 7.4% K-1 and the optimal temperature uncertainty calculated is 0.03\u2005K at 303\u2005K.

However, the nonradiative recombination originating from the surface undercoordinated Sn2+ cations and the energetic offsets between different layers cause an excessive energy loss and deteriorate the perovskite device's performance. In this study, we investigated two thioamide derivatives that differ only in the polar part connected to their common benzene ring, namely, benzenecarbothioamide and 4-fluorophenylcarbothioamide (F-TBA). These two molecules were implemented as modifiers onto the inorganic tin-lead perovskite (CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br) surface in the perovskite solar cells. Modifiers that carry C\u2550S and NH2 functional groups, equipped with lone electron pairs, can autonomously associate with surface Sn2+ through coordination and electrostatic attraction mechanisms. This interaction serves effectively to passivate the surface. In addition, due to the permanent dipole moment of the intermediate layer, an interfacial dipole field appears at the PCBM/CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br interface, reducing the electron extraction potential barrier. Consequently, the planar solar cell with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br/PCBM/BCP/Ag layered structure featuring an F-TBA surface post-treatment demonstrated a noteworthy power conversion efficiency of 14.01%.

In particular, 80% of AD-susceptible \u03b54 allele copies were converted to the AD-neutral \u03b53 allele in human \u03b54-carrying embryos. Stringent control measures combined with targeted deep sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing showed no DNA or RNA off-target events in FNLS-YE1-treated human embryos or their derived stem cells. Furthermore, base editing with FNLS-YE1 showed no effects on embryo development to the blastocyst stage.

A new fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) thermometry, utilizing the ratio of the cube of 3F2,3 emission to the square of 1G4 emission of Tm3+ and retaining the feature of anti-interference of excitation light source fluctuations, is proposed. Under the hypotheses of the UC terms being neglected in the rate equations and the ratio of the cube of 3H4 emission to the square of 1G4 emission of Tm3+ being a constant in a relatively narrow temperature range, the new FIR thermometry is valid. The correctness of all hypotheses was confirmed by testing and analyzing the power-dependent emission spectra at different temperatures and the temperature-dependent emission spectra of CaWO4:Tm3+,Yb3+ phosphor. The results prove that the new ratiometric thermometry based on UC luminescence with different multi-photon processes is feasible through optical signal processing, and maximum relative sensitivity of the thermometry is 6.61%\u2005K-1 at 303\u2005K.

It shows that TDY-\u03b1 processes a higher glass transition temperature, better crystallinity relative to its individual small-molecule acceptor segment and isomeric counterpart of TDY-\u03b2, and a more stable morphology with the polymer donor. As a result, the TDY-\u03b1 based device delivers a higher device efficiency of 18.1%, and most important, achieves an extrapolated lifetime of about 35000\u2009hours that retaining 80% of their initial efficiency.

In this study, we found the expression of AQP8 was reduced in liver specimens of patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice and genetically obese db/db mice. Knockdown of AQP8 in hepatocytes exacerbated the intracellular lipid accumulation induced by free fatty acid (FFA) mixtures. In contrast, hepatic AQP8 overexpression activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), inhibiting gene expression associated with lipogenesis, which further reduced intrahepatic triglyceride overload in obese mice. FXR knockout abrogated the ameliorating effect of AQP8 overexpression on NAFLD in mice.

However, the easy and large-scale preparation of graphene and molybdenum disulfide composites with structural stability and excellent performance face enormous challenges. In this study, a self-supporting network-structured MoS2/heteroatom-doped graphene (MoS2/NSGs-G) composite is prepared by a simple and exercisable electrochemical exfoliation followed by a hydrothermal route. In the composite, layered MoS2 nanosheets and heteroatom-doped graphene nanosheets are intertwined with each other into self-supporting network architecture, which could hold back the aggregation of MoS2 and graphene effectively. Moreover, the composite possesses enlarged interlayer spacing of graphene and MoS2, which could contribute to an increase in the reaction sites and ion transport of the composite. Owing to these advantageous structural characteristics and the heteroatomic co-doping of nitrogen and sulfur, MoS2/NSGs-G demonstrates greatly reversible sodium storage capacity. The measurements revealed that the reversible cycle capacity was 443.9 mA h g-1 after 250 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, and the rate capacity was 491.5, 490.5, 453.9, 418.1, 383.8, 333.1, and 294.4 mA h g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the MoS2/NSGs-G sample displayed lower resistance, dominant pseudocapacitive contribution, and faster sodium ion interface kinetics characteristic.

Recent studies have demonstrated that DIO reduces bone loss. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DIO on the gut microbiota (GM) of ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation (sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle group) or ovariectomy. For 12\u00a0weeks, OVX rats were treated using a vehicle (OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle group) and DIO (OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO group). Subsequently, ELISA was conducted to determine serum estradiol levels, micro-CT scanning was performed to evaluate bone quality, and feces were collected for metagenomics sequencing to examine the structure and function of GM. Raw reads were filtered to remove chimera sequences. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered in the filtered reads. A Venn diagram analysis was conducted to study the common and unique OTUs in the sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO groups. LEfSe analysis was conducted to evaluate the specific GM of the three groups. The GM functions were analyzed using the KEGG and CAZy databases. After a 12-week treatment, DIO administration prevented OVX-induced weight gain and increased the estradiol levels. DIO treatment improved the bone microstructure and structural parameters of rat tibias. Metagenomics sequencing results identified 1139, 1207, and 1235 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO groups, respectively. The percentage of common OTUs was 41.2%. Treatment with DIO restored the composition of GM in OVX rats by increasing the abundance of Coriobacteriia Adlercreutzia, Romboutsia, and Romboutsia_idealis and reducing the abundance of Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Methanobacteria, Bacteroides, Phocaeicola, Alistipes, Bacteroids_uniformis, Bacteroids_xylanisolvens. The anti-osteoporosis effect of DIO can be regulated through environmental information processing, organismal Systems, Cellular Processes, human diseases, metabolism, and genetic information processing. Meanwhile, treatment with DIO improved GM homeostasis by increasing the metabolism of carbohydrates, other amino acids, and glycans and reducing translation, energy metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. DIO can reduce bone loss by regulating the structural composition and function of GM, a novel strategy for preventing osteoporosis.", "Keywords": ["Diosgenin", "Gut microbiota", "Metagenomics sequencing", "Osteoporosis", "Ovariectomized rats"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Rats", "Animals", "Humans", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Bone Density", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Diosgenin", "Bone Diseases, Metabolic", "Osteoporosis", "Estradiol", "Ovariectomy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Changheng", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Pei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanjing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.

In a proteomic screen, we identified BACH1 as a cellular factor that recognizes the p53 DNA-binding domain depending on its mutation status. BACH1 strongly interacts with p53R175H but fails to effectively bind wild-type p53 or other hotspot mutants in vivo for functional regulation. Notably, p53R175H acts as a repressor for ferroptosis by abrogating BACH1-mediated downregulation of SLC7A11 to enhance tumor growth; conversely, p53R175H promotes BACH1-dependent tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of pro-metastatic targets. Mechanistically, p53R175H-mediated bidirectional regulation of BACH1 function is dependent on its ability to recruit the histone demethylase LSD2 to target promoters and differentially modulate transcription. These data demonstrate that BACH1 acts as a unique partner for p53R175H in executing its specific GOFs and suggest that different p53 mutants induce their GOFs through distinct mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Down-Regulation", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Mutation", "Proteomics", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhenyi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingjie", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiqing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Medical Sciences in Medicine, Zuckerman Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanwei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiaosi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroki", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiming", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoufu", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Medical Sciences in Medicine, Zuckerman Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Manfredi", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature cancer", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "36948236", "Title": "Research development and the prospect of animal models of mitochondrial DNA-related mitochondrial diseases.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are genetic and clinical heterogeneous diseases caused by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects.

This paper conducted a brain-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic bases of neuroimage phenotypes of pain sensitivity. In total, 432 normal participants were divided into high and low pain sensitivity groups according to the laser quantitative test threshold. Then, the brain's gray matter density (GMD) features correlated with pain sensitivity were identified. Next, GWAS was performed on each GMD phenotype using quality-controlled genotypes. Based on the heatmap and hierarchical clustering results, the right insula was identified for further refined analysis in terms of subregions GMD and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) phenotypes. The results indicate that the right insula GMD in the high sensitivity group is significantly lower than that in the low sensitivity group. Also, the TT/TC group at locus rs187974 has lower right insula GMD than the CC group. Further, loci at gene CYP2D6 may lead to a variation of rs-FC between the right insula and left putamen.

The current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based emotion decoding studies are mainly based on brief and isolated episodes of emotion induction, while sustained emotional experience in naturalistic environments that mirror daily life experiences are scarce. Here we used 12 different 10-minute movie clips as ecologically valid emotion-evoking procedures in n\u00a0=\u00a052 individuals to explore emotion-specific fMRI functional connectivity (FC) profiles on the whole-brain level at high spatial resolution (432 parcellations including cortical and subcortical structures). Employing machine-learning based decoding and cross validation procedures allowed to investigate FC profiles contributing to classification that can accurately distinguish sustained happiness and sadness and that generalize across subjects, movie clips, and parcellations. Both functional brain network-based and subnetwork-based emotion classification results suggested that emotion manifests as distributed representation of multiple networks, rather than a single functional network or subnetwork. Further, the results showed that the Visual Network (VN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) associated functional networks, especially VN-DMN, exhibited a strong contribution to emotion classification. To further estimate the temporal accumulative effect of naturalistic long-term movie-based video-evoking emotions, we divided the 10-min episode into three stages: early stimulation (1\u223c200\u00a0s), middle stimulation (201\u223c400\u00a0s), and late stimulation (401\u223c600\u00a0s) and examined the emotion classification performance at different stimulation stages. We found that the late stimulation contributes most to the classification (accuracy=85.32%, F1-score=85.62%) compared to early and middle stimulation stages, implying that continuous exposure to emotional stimulation can lead to more intense emotions and further enhance emotion-specific distinguishable representations. The present work demonstrated that sustained happiness and sadness under naturalistic conditions are presented in emotion-specific network profiles and these expressions may play different roles in the generation and modulation of emotions. These findings elucidated the importance of network level adaptations for sustained emotional experiences during naturalistic contexts and open new venues for imaging network level contributions under naturalistic conditions.", "Keywords": ["Emotion classification", "Functional connectivity", "Movie clips", "Naturalistic stimulation", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Emotions", "Brain", "Happiness", "Brain Mapping", "Head", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shuyue", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Computing and Intelligence, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Linling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongjie", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Danyi", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Computing and Intelligence, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Gan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiqin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Center of Psychosomatic Medicine, Sichuan Provincial Center for Mental Health, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Becker", "Affiliation": "Center of Psychosomatic Medicine, Sichuan Provincial Center for Mental Health, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.

However, the presence of artificial duplicate reads raised mainly from the preparation of metagenomic DNA sequencing libraries and their impacts on metagenomic assembly and binning have never been brought to attention. Here, we explicitly investigated the effects of duplicate reads on metagenomic assemblies and binning based on analyses of five groups of representative metagenomes with distinct microbiome complexities. Our results showed that deduplication considerably increased the binning yields (by 3.5% to 80%) for most of the metagenomic data sets examined thanks to the improved contig length and coverage profiling of metagenome-assembled contigs, whereas it slightly decreased the binning yields of metagenomes with low complexity (e.g., human gut metagenomes). Specifically, 411 versus 397, 331 versus 317, 104 versus 88, and 9 versus 5 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from MEGAHIT assemblies of bioreactor sludge, surface water, lake sediment, and forest soil metagenomes, respectively. Noticeably, deduplication significantly reduced the computational costs of the metagenomic assembly, including the elapsed time (9.0% to 29.9%) and the maximum memory requirement (4.3% to 37.1%). Collectively, we recommend the removal of duplicate reads in metagenomes with high complexity before assembly and binning analyses, for example, the forest soil metagenomes examined in this study. IMPORTANCE Duplicated reads in shotgun metagenomes are usually considered technical artifacts. Their presence in metagenomes would theoretically not only introduce bias into the quantitative analysis but also result in mistakes in the coverage profile, leading to adverse effects on or even failures in metagenomic assembly and binning, as the widely used metagenome assemblers and binners all need coverage information for graph partitioning and assembly binning, respectively. However, this issue was seldom noticed, and its impacts on downstream essential bioinformatic procedures (e.g., assembly and binning) remained unclear. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated for the first time the implications of duplicate reads for the de novo assembly and binning of real metagenomic data sets by comparing the assembly qualities, binning yields, and requirements for computational resources with and without the removal of duplicate reads. It was revealed that deduplication considerably increased the binning yields of metagenomes with high complexity and significantly reduced the computational costs, including the elapsed time and the maximum memory requirement, for most of the metagenomes studied.

However, its inherent \"volume effect\" may easily turn tin-based electrode materials into powder and make them fall off in the cycle process, eventually leading to the reduction of the specific capacity, rate and cycle performance of the batteries. Considering the \"volume effect\" of tin, this study proposes to construct a carbon coating and three-dimensional graphene network to obtain a \"double confinement\" of metal tin, so as to improve the cycle and rate performance of the composite. This excellent construction can stabilize the tin and prevent its agglomeration during heat treatment and its pulverization during cycling, improving the electrochemical properties of tin-based composites. When the optimized composite material of C@Sn/NSGr-7.5 was used as an anode material in LIB, it maintained a specific capacity of about 667 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g-1 and exhibited a good cycle performance.

By video tracking optically trapped sperm cells from different patients, both rolling chirality and rolling frequency were analyzed. In this study, all the vertically trapped human sperm cells adopt a right-hand longitudinal rolling. The orientation and rolling frequency but not the rolling chirality of sperm in the optical trap are affected by the trap height.

Increasing studies have shown that Cd exposure increases the incidence of various endocrine system diseases, including thyrotoxicity reflected by thyroid structural damage and endocrine toxicity. However, the observed outcomes are complex and conflicting, leading to the mechanism of Cd-induced thyrotoxicity remaining obscure. In this study, 4-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were given 2 or 7\u00a0mg/kg Cadmium Chloride (CdCl2) intragastrically for 4 and 8 weeks, and the Cd-mediated thyrotoxicity was evaluated by determining alterations in thyroid structure and endocrine function, and alterations of oxidant stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis. Our data showed that Cd exposure could reduce body weight and induce thyrotoxicity by impairing thyroid follicular morphology and endocrine function, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine secretion.

Mechanistical analysis suggested that Cd treatment could inhibit antioxidant pathway by downregulating antioxidant response protein, Nrf2, and upregulating its negative feedback regulator, Keap1.

The RAW264.7 cell line is widely used to study osteoclastic differentiation and biological molecular mechanism. However, protocols for inducing osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells vary considerably between laboratories, hindering the replication of results. Therefore, we tested the influence of culture conditions on osteoclast differentiation, including cell density and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) concentrations with or without macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to detect the morphology of osteoclasts. qPCR was used to detect gene expression of osteoclast-specific gene marker cathepsin K (CTSK), osteoclast transcription factors c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). The bone resorption function was evaluated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RANKL treatment increased multinucleated osteoclasts formation and increased CTSK, c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Compared with RANKL treatment, M-CSF significantly decreased multinucleated osteoclasts formation, reduced CTSK gene expression and had little effect on c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Concerning bone resorption activity, RANKL treatment increased bone resorption pits on bovine bone slices. Significantly higher levels of osteoclastogenesis were observed with RAW264.7-cell density of 2\u00d7104 cells/well in 24-well plates.

In the present work, we wondered whether ICA can attenuate NAFLD in db/db mice treated with ICA for 8 weeks and how ICA exerts an influence on NAFLD. In db/db mice, ICA treatment had a robust effect on inhibition of lipogenesis associated with NAFLD amelioration by decreasing liver lipid deposition, together with ameliorating insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and fasting serum glucose. Of note, ICA-treated rats showed a much higher concentration of icaritin (ICT) in plasma, a major metabolite of ICA, about 2000 times higher than that of ICA by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Interestingly, ICT, rather than ICA, can dramatically decrease hepatic lipogenesis-related markers in oleate acid/palmitate acid (OA/PA)-induced steatosis in primary hepatocytes (PH) and HepG2 cells, and hepatic lipid accumulation in db/db mice, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of ICT on lipogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that anti-lipogenic activities of ICT were related to reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as evidenced by Western blot, qPCR, and other assays in thapsigargin (THP) induced-ER stress models.

A total of 3927 proteins were accurately quantitated and 46, 36, 35, and 102 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were obtained in the S4, S4-1, T14, and T33 varieties, respectively. Four proteins were randomly selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays, and the results verified the reliability of the mass spectrometry (MS) results. The response mechanism of the drought-sensitive sorghum leaves to drought was attributed to the upregulation of proteins involved in the tyrosine metabolism pathway with defense functions. Drought-resistant sorghum leaves respond to drought by promoting the TCA cycle, enhancing sphingolipid biosynthesis, interfering with triterpenoid metabolite synthesis, and influencing aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. The 17 screened important candidate proteins related to drought stress were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the results of which were consistent with the results of the proteomic analysis. This study lays the foundation for revealing the drought-resistance mechanism of sorghum at the protein level. These findings will help us cultivate and improve new drought-resistant sorghum varieties.", "Keywords": ["comparative proteome analysis", "differentially abundant proteins", "drought stress", "leaf system", "seedling stage", "sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Based on the simulation results, an integrated CPV-TE device was designed, fabricated, and tested under a high-power laser. The novel integrated CPV-TE system utilizes growing electrodes to encapsulate CPV directly on the TEG. Compared to conventional CPV-TE systems that utilize silicone-filled, the integrated CPV-TE system reduces contact thermal resistance and increases output power as well as conversion efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discuss and optimize a CPV-TE hybrid system for laser radiation.

In this work, an EEG-based biometric competition based on a large-scale M3CV (A Multi-subject, Multi-session, and Multi-task Database for investigation of EEG Commonality and Variability) database was launched to better characterize and harness the intra- and inter-subject variability and promote the development of machine learning algorithm in this field. In the M3CV database, EEG signals were recorded from 106 subjects, of which 95 subjects repeated two sessions of the experiments on different days. The whole experiment consisted of 6 paradigms, including resting-state, transient-state sensory, steady-state sensory, cognitive oddball, motor execution, and steady-state sensory with selective attention with 14 types of EEG signals, 120000 epochs. Two learning tasks (identification and verification), performance metrics, and baseline methods were introduced in the competition.

Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors.

Nucleus pulposus (NP) cell senescence plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of IVDD. Morroniside is a major iridoid glycoside and one of the quality control metrics of Cornus officinalis Siebold & Zucc (CO). An increasing body of evidence suggests that morroniside and CO-containing formulae share many similar biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties. In a previous study, we reported that Liuwei Dihuang Decoction, a CO-containing formula, is effective for treating IVDD by targeting p53 expression; however, the therapeutic role of morroniside on IVDD remains obscure. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of morroniside on NP cell senescence and IVDD pathogenesis using a lumbar spine instability surgery-induced mouse IVDD model and an in vitro H2O2-induced NP cell senescence model. Our results demonstrated that morroniside administration could significantly ameliorate mouse IVDD progression, concomitant with substantial improvement in extracellular matrix metabolism and histological grading score. Importantly, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that morroniside could significantly reduce the increase in SA-\u03b2-gal activities and the expression of p53 and p21, which are the most widely used indicators of senescence. Mechanistically, morroniside suppressed ROS-induced aberrant activation of Hippo signaling by inhibiting Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 phosphorylation and reversing Yap/Taz reduction, whereas blockade of Hippo signaling by Yap/Taz inhibitor-1 or Yap/Taz siRNAs could antagonize the anti-senescence effect of morroniside on H2O2-induced NP cell senescence model by increasing p53 expression and activity. Moreover, the inhibition of Hippo signaling in the IVD tissues by morroniside was further verified in mouse IVDD model. Taken together, our findings suggest that morroniside protects against NP cell senescence to alleviate IVDD progression by inhibiting the ROS-Hippo-p53 pathway, providing a potential novel therapeutic approach for IVDD.", "Keywords": ["cell senescence", "hippo signaling", "intervertebral disc degeneration", "morroniside", "nucleus pulposus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chengcong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Sai", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Fangda", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Yishan", "Last Name": "Bian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Huihao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuying", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuying", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Weifeng", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Yue", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongting", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Peijian", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Chengliang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Ruan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36185450", "Title": "Formation of sweet potato starch nanoparticles by ultrasonic-assisted nanoprecipitation: Effect of cold plasma treatment.", "Abstract": "Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) were produced from sweet potato starches by ultrasonic treatment combined with rapid nanoprecipitation.

However, after freeze drying, the SNPs showed varying degrees of aggregation depending on the particle size of SNPs before freeze-drying. The smaller the particle size, the more serious the aggregation. Therefore, we tried to treat SNPs with dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma before freeze drying. Properties including morphological features, crystalline structure and apparent viscosity of various starches were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheometer, respectively. The results showed that, after cold plasma (CP) treatment, the aggregation of SNPs during freeze drying was significantly inhibited.

Specifically, four different dietary fibers were extracted by hot water, microwave, ultrasonic and subcritical water methods. And the prebiotics effects of sweet potato peels dietary fibers were explored in an in vitro fermentation model, by determining intestinal gas content, short-chain fatty acid content, pH, ammonia content and the gut microbiota composition. The results showed that dietary fiber obtained by four different extraction methods could be utilized by GM and improve human health by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella) and reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria, Romboutsia and Dorea), enhancing the relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, reducing intestinal pH from 6.89 to 4.63 and ammonia. Among them, dietary fiber extracted by ultrasound is better than the other three extraction methods. This study suggests that all the four different extraction methods are available for sweet potato peels dietary fiber, and the extracted dietary fiber could be served as potential functional foods with great development value.

The role of non-decayed recent wood of relevant species on preservation state estimation was studied in prior, showing the use of non-decayed recent wood could not improve the predictive ability. Besides, the high variability in terms of chemical structure between archaeological softwoods and archaeological hardwoods did affect the preservation state estimation. Thus, a simple OPLS-DA model of non-destructively distinguishing archaeological hardwoods from softwoods, R2Xcum of 0.659, R2Ycum of 0.836 and Q2cum of 0.763, was established to avoid and overcome destructive approach for wood identification. Then, the well-defined three grouped separations of slightly-decayed, moderately-decayed and severely-decayed waterlogged archaeological woods were revealed in OPLS-DA models, providing R2Xcum of 0.793, R2Ycum of 0.738, Q2cum of 0.680, and R2Xcum of 0.780, R2Ycum of 0.901, Q2cum of 0.870, for waterlogged archaeological hardwoods and waterlogged archaeological softwoods respectively. Potential predictive wood spectral bands were screened and tentatively identified as hydroxyls of crystalline cellulose, acetyl groups of hemicelluloses, C-H bands of lignin, which guaranteed the elimination of non-structural compounds, such as water and inorganic components interference. Furthermore, the developed NIR methodology was validated by an extensively used destructive method consisting of anatomical characteristics, maximum water content and basic density analyses.

Biliary NIK directly increases cholangiocyte proliferation while suppressing cholangiocyte death, and it also promotes secretion of cholangiokines from cholangiocytes.

Melatonin has a substantial protective effect against female reproductive toxicity. This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of melatonin on DEHP-induced damage of human granulosa cells (GCs) in vitro and explore the potential mechanisms. Here, we found that melatonin treatment alleviated DEHP-induced human GCs apoptosis and improved mitochondrial function via inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) mediated mitochondrial fission. Melatonin inhibited the expression, activation and oligomerization of Drp1, which decreased translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria in DEHP-exposed human GCs. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, sustained mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased cytochrome c release. Further research showed that AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signal pathway was involved in the inhibition of melatonin on Drp1 expression and activation. Melatonin treatment promoted AMPK activation suppressed by DEHP, and activated AMPK recovered the balance of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616 and Ser637 sites and enhanced PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Moreover, PGC-1\u03b1 could prevent mitochondrial fission by decreasing Drp1 expression directly via binding to its promoter. In contrast, blocking of AMPK or PGC-1\u03b1 with specific inhibitor negated the protective effects of melatonin on mitochondrial homeostasis and GCs apoptosis.

The physical and chemical properties of fly ash were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy spectrum analysis, and XRD. The content and different forms of the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Co, and Ni were determined by acid digestion, oscillation leaching, and Tessier five-step extraction. The effect of pH, temperature, and particle size on the leached amount of heavy metals was studied. Finally, the ecological risk index was calculated for each heavy metal via the risk assessment coding (RAC) method and Hakanson ecological risk assessment method, allowing the ecological risk of fly ash to be determined under different environmental conditions. Results showed that the average concentrations of Cd, Cr, Co, and Ni were all below the risk screening values reported for environmental pollutants (pH > 7.5). Under varying pH, temperature, and particle size conditions, the leached amounts (oscillation leaching) were below the soil risk screening values for agricultural land in China. An RAC-Cd value of >50% indicates a high ecological risk, while the RAC values of Co and Ni were between 10 and 30%, indicating a medium ecological risk, and the RAC values of Cr and Cu were <10%, indicating a low ecological risk. With increasing pH, the potential ecological risk index (RI) decreased, with a maximum RI of 59.62 observed at pH 2.8. With increasing temperature, the potential ecological RI increased initially to a maximum of 27.69 at 25\u00b0C and then decreased thereafter.

Here, we report a low-temperature conversion of polyethylene into olefins. By mixing the polyethylene feed with rationally designed ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets at 280 \u00b0C in flowing hydrogen as a carrier gas, light hydrocarbons (C1-C7) were produced with a yield of up to 74.6%, where 83.9% of these products were C3-C6 olefins with almost undetectable coke formation. The reaction proceeds in multiple steps, including polyethylene melting, flowing to access the zeolite surface, cracking on the zeolite surface, formation of intermediates to diffuse into the zeolite micropores, and cracking into small molecules in the zeolite micropores. The ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets kinetically matched the cascade cracking steps on the zeolite external surface and within micropores by boosting the intermediate diffusion. This feature efficiently suppressed the intermediate accumulation on the zeolite surface to minimize coke formation. In addition, we found that hydrogen participation in the cracking process could hinder the formation of polycyclic species within zeolite micropores, which also contributes to the rapid molecule diffusion. The coking-resistant polyethylene upcycling process at a low temperature not only overturns the general viewpoint for facile coke formation in the catalytic cracking over the zeolites but also demonstrates how the polyethylene-based plastics can be upcycled to valuable chemicals. In addition to the model polyethylene, the reaction system worked efficiently for the depolymerization of multiple practically used polyethylene-rich plastics, enabling an industrially and

The effect of citric acid and malic acid on the form of Pb present in the reclaimed soil was analyzed by spiking soil samples and simulating Pb-contaminated soil. The results indicate the following. 1) With increased concentration of exogenous Pb, the activity of Pb in the reclaimed soil was effectively improved. 2) The addition of citric acid and malic acid both resulted in an increased fraction of exchangeable Pb in the soil, which effectively promoted the active Pb fraction. As the concentrations of citric acid and malic acid increased, the active Pb fraction of the reclaimed soil increased accordingly. The Pb activation effect of citric acid was observed to be greater than that of malic acid. 3) With extended soil aging time, the activation effect of organic acids on Pb weakened, with the loosely bound Pb gradually transforming into strongly bound Pb. Chelating agents can activate heavy metals in soil, mainly through the combination of chelating agents and heavy metal ions in the soil solution to form soluble metal chelates, so as to increase the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil to plant roots.

Estradiol (E1), diethylstilbestrol (DES), estriol (E3), \u03b2-estradiol (E2), and ethinylestradiol (EE2) were used as the target analytes. A single factor optimization method was performed to optimize the extraction effect by adding estrogens to honey samples. The optimal conditions were as follows. A total of 30 mg IL-COF-1 was filled in the SPE column. The sample pH was adjusted to 7. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 3 mL/min and eluted with 5 mL of a 1% (v/v) NH3\u00b7H2O-methanol solution. The flow rate of the eluent was 0.4 mL/min. NaCl was not added in the extraction process. HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was introduced to quantify the estrogens in the extracts. The estrogens were separated on a Thermo Fisher Scientific C18 analytical column (100 mm\u00d72.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Acetonitrile and 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution were used as the mobile phases for gradient elution. The column temperature was set at 40 \u2103, and the autosampler temperature was maintained at 10 \u2103. The rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of the five estrogens in the honey samples was operated under multiple reaction monitoring mode in a negative electrospray ion source mode. IL-COF-1 prepared in six batches was used as a filler for the SPE column. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the recoveries of the estrogens among different batches were 5.2%-9.1%. The reusability of IL-COF-1 material was assessed. After six SPE cycles on the same solid-phase extraction column, the RSDs of the estrogen recoveries were 2.5%-6.1%, indicating that IL-COF-1 has good reusability. The recoveries of estrogens obtained on an IL-COF-1 solid-phase extraction column within 6 days (tested once a day) were 95.1%-107.4%, and the RSDs were 6.2%-8.9%. These results confirmed that the SPE filler had good stability. The method validation results showed that the linear detection ranges were 1-500 ng/g for E3, E2, and EE2, and 0.1-100 ng/g for E1 and DES withe the correlation coefficients of 0.9934-0.9972. The limits of detection (LODs, S/N=3) were 0.01-0.30 ng/g, and the limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N=10) were 0.05-0.95 ng/g. Five estrogens were added (50 ng/g) for the repeated experiments. The RSDs of the intra-day precision were 3.2%-6.6%. The RSDs of the inter-day precision were 4.2%-7.9%. This method was applied to determine the estrogen levels in four honey samples, and no estrogen was found. The recoveries of the five estrogens in sample spiked at three levels including low, middle, and high levels were investigated, and satisfactory recoveries (80.1%-115.2%) were obtained.

Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to realize a quasi-three-dimensional refinement of the pore structure that utilizes the tunability of ring size and number in polycycloalkane-dicarboxylate ligands. Two hydrolytically stable MOFs with a confined aliphatic pore environment, ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2, were, for the first time, synthesized and applied in separating low-concentration C2-C3 hydrocarbons from natural gas and ultralow-concentration Xe from used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas. Validated by X-ray diffraction and modeling, an expansion of the polycycloalkane moiety enables sub-angstrom contraction in specific directions and forms a pore surface with more alkyl sites, which affords stronger trapping of guest molecules with relatively higher polarizability. The resultant material exhibits record C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 selectivities coupled with a benchmark low-pressure C2H6 capacity in alkane mixture separation and also a benchmark Xe capacity at extremely diluted feed concentration and record Kr productivity for the Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) mixture in Xe/Kr separation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jingyi", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Felix", "Last Name": "Steinke", "Affiliation": "Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Max-Eyth-Stra\u00dfe 2, 24118 Kiel, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Norbert", "Last Name": "Stock", "Affiliation": "Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Max-Eyth-Stra\u00dfe 2, 24118 Kiel, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Zongbi", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Qilong", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiwei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2022Aug10"}, {"PMID": "35848078", "Title": "Nickel-Catalyzed Deaminative Allenylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Catalytic Activity Enhanced by an Amide-Type NN2 Pincer Ligand.", "Abstract": "Herein, we report a general and practical nickel-catalyzed deaminative allenylation of amino acid derivatives with terminal alkynes.

We calculated point-by-point multiplication between two regional time series to estimate the time-resolved dynamic connectivity, and estimated the inter-individual consistency of the dynamic connectivity time series. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip, which also showed differences between the clips. For example, a cartoon movie clip, Wall-E, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip, A Few Good Men, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which might suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents.

Herein, we developed a simple and cheap boron trifluoride etherate-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation for addressing this challenge, and found that the coupling of the aldehyde-terminated D unit and the A-end groups could be quantitatively finished in the presence of acetic anhydride within 15\u2009minutes at room temperature.

Molecular sieving separation of C3H6/C3H8 on stable carbon adsorbents appeals to be promising, while it is quite challenging to realize due to the random distributions and arrangements of the internal pores in common carbons. Herein, a series of polysaccharide-based CD-MOF-derived ultramicroporous carbon adsorbents with their pore size tuned at a subangstrom level were prepared. Molecular sieving separation of C3H6/C3H8 was realized on the optimal C-CDMOF-2-700 owing to the delicate structure with an appropriate pore size (5.0 \u00c5). Besides, C-CDMOF-2-700 exhibited a high C3H6 uptake of 1.97 mmol g-1 under ambient conditions. An ultrahigh uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 at 1.0 kPa (403) was also achieved, outperforming all reported adsorbents. Kinetic adsorption tests and breakthrough experiments further demonstrate this well-designed carbon adsorbent to be promising in industrial C3H6/C3H8 separation.", "Keywords": ["adsorption separation", "carbon adsorbent", "metal\u2212organic frameworks", "molecular sieving", "propane", "propylene"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fuqiang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 38 Zheda Road, Hangzhou 310027, P.

To address this issue, two fluorinated perylene-diimides (PDIs), PDINN-F and PDINN-2F, are synthesized by a simple fluorination method, for application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay-fluorinated PDI-based CILs possess a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of \u2248-4.0\u00a0eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR-SMAs (such as BTP-eC9)/CIL for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The monofluorinated PDINN-F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN-F-based OSCs with PM6:BTP-eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short-circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN-F CIL retain more than 80% of their initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 h.

To date, many regulatory genes influencing leaf morphology in rice have been cloned, and their underlying molecular regulatory mechanism has been preliminarily clarified. However, the fine regulation relationship of leaf morphogenesis and plant type remains largely elusive. In this study, a rolling-leaf mutant, named rlm1-D, was obtained and controlled by a pair of dominant nuclear genes. Cytological observations revealed that the rlm1 was mainly caused by abnormal deposition of secondary cell walls. Molecular evidence showed ectopic expression of a MYB-type transcription factor LOC_Os05g46610 was responsible for the phenotype of rlm1-D. A series of experiments, including the transcription factor-centered technology, DNA-binding assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, verified that RLM1 can bind to the promoter of OsCAD2, a key gene responsible for lignin biosynthesis in rice. An interacting partner of RLM1, OsMAPK10, was identified. Multiple biochemical assays confirmed that OsMAPK10 interacted with RLM1. OsMAPK10 positively regulated the lignin content in the leaves and stems of rice. Moreover, OsMAPK10 contributes to RLM1 activation of downstream target genes. In particular, RLM1 is exclusively expressed in the stems at the mature plant stage. The yield of RLM1 knockdown lines increased by over 11% without other adverse agricultural trait penalties, indicating great practical application value. A MAPK-MYB-OsCAD2 genetic regulatory network controlling SCW was proposed, providing a theoretical significance and practical value for shaping the ideal plant type and improving rice yield.", "Keywords": ["R2R3 MYB transcription factor", "RLM1", "rice", "secondary cell wall", "yield"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhenhua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shouzhen", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Liying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuean", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinxia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengfei", "Last Name": "Ai", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Biology, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuehui", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tiegang", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in plant science", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35607251", "Title": "Spatiotemporal Release of Reactive Oxygen Species and NO for Overcoming Biofilm Heterogeneity.", "Abstract": "The heterogeneity in biofilms is a major challenge in biofilm therapies due to different susceptibility of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to antibacterial agents.

In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where they were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used for predictions. We first found that daylight length and air temperatures could be reliably predicted with cross-validation using the resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also be achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using the segmented or raw anatomical images. Finally, the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner.

In this study, we optimized the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) process of extracting flavonoids from Hemerocallis fulva leaves by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum extraction conditions generating the maximal total flavonoids content was as follows: 70.6% ethanol concentration; 43.9:1 mL/g solvent to sample ratio; 61.7 \u00b0C extraction temperature. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the total flavonoid content (TFC) in eight Hemerocallis fulva varieties were determined, and H. fulva (L.) L. var. kwanso Regel had the highest TFC. The cytotoxicity of the extract was studied using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 assay). When the concentration was less than 1.25 mg/mL, the extract had no significant cytotoxicity to HaCaT cells. The antioxidant activity was measured via chemical antioxidant activity methods in vitro and via cellular antioxidant activity methods. The results indicated that the extract had a strong ABTS and \u2022OH radical scavenging activity. Additionally, the extract had an excellent protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, which could effectively reduce the level of ROS to 106.681 \u00b1 9.733% (p < 0.001), compared with the 163.995 \u00b1 6.308% of the H2O2 group. We identified five flavonoids in the extracts using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Infrared spectroscopy indicated that the extract contained the structure of flavonoids.

While multi-center datasets increase sample size and representation ability, they suffer from inter-center heterogeneity. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation framework for this diagnosis task, which not only considers domain-invariant and domain-specific features, but also achieves the imbalanced knowledge transfer and class-aware feature alignment across domains. First, we develop a 3D improved feature pyramidal network (i.e., 3D IFPN) to extract common multi-level features from the high-resolution 3D CT images, where a feature dynamic transfer (FDT) module can promote the network's ability to recognize the small target (i.e., LN). Then, we design an unsupervised domain selective graph convolutional network (i.e., UDS-GCN), which mainly includes three types of components: domain-specific feature extractor, domain selector and class-aware GCN classifier. Specifically, multiple domain-specific feature extractors are employed for learning domain-specific features from the common multi-level features generated by the 3D IFPN. A domain selector via the optimal transport (OT) theory is designed for controlling the amount of knowledge transferred from source domains to the target domain. A class-aware GCN classifier is developed to explicitly enhance/weaken the intra-class/inter-class similarity of all sample pairs across domains. To optimize UDS-GCN, the domain selector and the class-aware GCN classifier provide reliable target pseudo-labels to each other in the iterative process by collaborative learning. The extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house CT image dataset collected from four medical centers to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Experimental results verify that the proposed method boosts LN metastasis diagnosis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, whether LRWD1 plays a role during development and the functional significance of LRWD1 in vivo remains largely unknown. Using gene-trap approach we generated Lrwd1 knockout mice and examined the expression of Lrwd1 during embryonic development. We found that Lrwd1 is ubiquitously expressed in the majority of the developing mouse embryo. Depletion of LRWD1 did not affect embryonic development but the postnatal growth of the homozygous mutants is retarded. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of LRWD1 displayed a reduced proliferation compared to wild type cells. We also showed that the knockout of Lrwd1 in MEFs increased the expression of the epigenetically silenced repetitive elements but with minimal effect on the expression of protein coding genes.

In addition, the ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of \u2248205 and \u2248306\u00a0nm, respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for all-PSCs with a thick photoactive layer.", "Keywords": ["all-polymer solar cells", "energy level matching", "morphology control", "photoactive layer thickness", "ternary devices"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenqing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, and Green Catalysis Center, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenkai", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, and Green Catalysis Center, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China."}, {"First Name": "Indunil", "Last Name": "Angunawela", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Organic and Carbon Electronics Laboratories (ORaCEL), North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Shucheng", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Liuyang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaman", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongmei", "Last Name": "Zhuo", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, and Green Catalysis Center, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Guo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic/Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Harald", "Last Name": "Ade", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Organic and Carbon Electronics Laboratories (ORaCEL), North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yongfang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China."}], "Journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2022May"}, {"PMID": "35262653", "Title": "EEG microstate correlates of emotion dynamics and stimulation content during video watching.", "Abstract": "EEG microstates have been widely adopted to understand the complex and dynamic-changing process in dynamic brain systems, but how microstates are temporally modulated by emotion dynamics is still unclear.

However, the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis still remains elusive. Here, we report that the calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11) is consistently upregulated in the integrated data from GSE liver fibrosis and tree shrew liver proteomics. S100A11 is also experimentally activated in liver fibrosis in mouse, rat, tree shrew, and human with liver fibrosis. While overexpression of S100A11 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro exacerbates liver fibrosis, the inhibition of S100A11 improves liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, S100A11 activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the fibrogenesis process via the regulation of the deacetylation of Smad3 in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. S100A11 physically interacts with SIRT6, a deacetylase of Smad2/3, which may competitively inhibit the interaction between SIRT6 and Smad2/3. The subsequent release and activation of Smad2/3 promote the activation of HSCs and fibrogenesis. Additionally, a significant elevation of S100A11 in serum is observed in clinical patients.

However, current studies mainly focus on rest-state EEG recordings, microstate analysis for the recording of EEG signals during naturalistic tasks is limited. It remains an open question whether current topographical clustering strategies for rest-state microstate analysis could be directly applied to task-state EEG data under the natural and dynamic conditions and whether stable and reliable results could still be achieved. It is necessary to answer the question and explore whether the topographical clustering strategies would affect the performance of microstate detection in task-state EEG microstate analysis. If it exists differences in microstate detection performance when different topographical clustering strategies are adopted, then we want to know how the alternations of the topographical clustering strategies are associated with the naturalistic task. To answer these questions, we work on a public emotion database using naturalistic and dynamic music videos as the stimulation to evaluate the effects of different topographical clustering strategies for task-state EEG microstate analysis. The performance results are systematically examined and compared in terms of microstate quality, task efficacy, and computational efficiency, and the impact of topographical clustering strategies on microstate analysis for naturalistic task data is discussed. The results reveal that a single-trial-based bottom-up topographical clustering strategy (bottom-up) achieves comparable results with the task-driven-based top-down topographical clustering (top-down).

In this study, a new in vitro gene stacking system, GuanNan Stacking (GNS), was developed. Through the introduction of Type IIS restriction enzyme-mediated Golden Gate cloning, GNS allows the modular, standardized assembly of target gene expression cassettes. Because of the introduction of Gateway recombination, GNS facilitates the cloning of superlarge transgene expression cassettes, allows multiple expression cassettes to be efficiently assembled in a binary vector simultaneously, and is compatible with the Cre enzyme-mediated marker deletion mechanism. The linked dual positive-negative marker selection strategy ensures the efficient acquisition of target recombinant plasmids without prokaryotic selection markers in the T-DNA region. The host-independent negative selection marker combined with the TAC backbone ensures the cloning and transfer of large T-DNAs (>100 kb).

As a novel Chinese medicine formula, Zhuanggu Busui formula (ZGBSF) has been proved to be an effective prescription for treating OP in clinic, however, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects remain obscure. In this study, we explored the pharmacological mechanisms of ZGBSF against OP via network pharmacology analysis coupled with in vivo experimental validation. The results of the network pharmacology analysis showed that a total of 86 active ingredients and 164 targets of ZGBSF associated with OP were retrieved from the corresponding databases, forming an ingredient-target-disease network. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network manifested that 22 core targets, including Caspase-3, BCL2L1, TP53, Akt1, etc, were hub targets. Moreover, functional enrichment analyses revealed that PI3K-Akt and apoptosis signalings were significantly enriched by multiple targets and served as the targets for in vivo experimental study validation. The results of animal experiments revealed that ZGBSF not only reversed the high expression of Caspase-3, Bax, Prap, and low expression of Bcl-2 in osteoblasts of the OP mouse model but also contributed to the phosphorylation of Akt1 and expression of PI3K, thereby promoting osteogenesis and ameliorating the progression of OP.

However, through a series of remote sensing algorithm optimizations from spectral calibration to retrieval, we successfully retrieved global gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO), from EMI during the pandemic. The abrupt drop in NO2 successfully captured the time for each city when effective measures were implemented to prevent the spread of the pandemic, for example, in January 2020 in Chinese cities, February in Seoul, and March in Tokyo and various cities across Europe and America. Furthermore, significant decreases in HCHO in Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Seoul indicated that the majority of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions were anthropogenic. Contrastingly, the lack of evident reduction in Beijing and New Delhi suggested dominant natural sources of VOCs.

Functional orthologues of eukaryotic Spt5 are present in archaea and bacteria, reflecting its universal role in RNA polymerase processivity. However, eukaryotic Spt5 is unique in having an acidic amino terminal tail (Spt5N) that is sandwiched between the downstream nucleosome and the upstream DNA that emerges from Pol II.

In this study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs did not guarantee higher reliability. A perspective of neural oscillation should be adopted for the analysis of reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs with an oscillation-based computational model, we found that the consistency between group-level ERP responses and individual reliability was modulated by inter-subject latency jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings suggest that the conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the individual reliability in ERPs and a neural oscillation perspective on ERP reliability should be considered.

Our previous studies have found that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) molecules are highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) patients. The purpose of this study was to further detect the expression of HMGB1 and pyroptosis in decidual tissue of URSA patients, and explore the potential mechanism of the protective role of HMGB1 in URSA patients and mouse model. The decidua tissues of 75 URSA patients and 75 women who actively terminated pregnancy were collected, and URSA mouse models were established and treated with HMGB1 inhibitor-aspirin. The expression of HMGB1, and their receptors (RAGE, TLR2, TLR4), pyroptosis-associated proteins (NLRP-3, caspase-1, GSDMD) and NF-\u03baB was examined at the maternal-fetal interface of human and mouse. Our study found that HMGB1, NLRP-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, RAGE, TLR2 and TLR4 were highly expressed and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were activated in the decidua tissue of URSA group. Moreover, immune cell disorder and co-localization of HMGB1 and macrophages were found at the maternal-fetal interface of URSA mice.

However, the dynamics of alpha oscillations, especially how the endogenous alpha oscillations be entrained by exogenous stimulus, are still unclear. Recently, a newly-developed phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF) protocol has shown effectiveness in modulating alpha rhythm, which provides empirical evidence for the further investigation of the neural mechanism of alpha dynamics. In this work, extensive numerical simulations based on four well-studied models were used to investigate the questions that (1) What kind of dynamic model exhibits a modulation phenomenon of PLVF? (2) What is the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for alpha modulation? (3) Which factors affect the modulation effects in PLVF? The result indicates that the dynamics of endogenous alpha oscillations are close to a simpler dynamic structure, like fixed-point attractor or limit-cycle attractor, which shows a global consistent dynamic behavior at different phases of the alpha oscillation. The further analysis explains the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for amplitude and frequency modulation of the alpha rhythm, as well as the influence of parameter settings in the modulation. All these findings provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous alpha oscillations entrained by exogenous phased locked visual stimulus and lead in turn to the refinement of a control strategy for alpha modulation, which could potentially be used in developing new neural modulation methods for cognitive enhancement and mental diseases treatment.", "Keywords": ["Endogenous alpha oscillations", "Exogenous visual stimulus", "Neural modulation", "Phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF)"], "MeSH terms": ["Alpha Rhythm", "Electroencephalography", "Feedback, Sensory", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xingyi", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong\u00a0518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Linling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Gan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518060, China.

The best-studied example is iron deficiency anemia, which increases intestinal iron absorption. Interestingly, the intestinal response to anemia is very similar to that of iron overload disorders, as both the conditions activate a transcriptional program that leads to a hyperabsorption of iron via the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1 (HIF2\u03b1). However, pathways for selective targeting of intestine-mediated iron overload remain unknown. Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is a critical cargo receptor for autophagic breakdown of ferritin and the subsequent release of iron, in a process termed ferritinophagy. Our work demonstrates that NCOA4-mediated intestinal ferritinophagy is integrated into systemic iron demand via HIF2\u03b1. To demonstrate the importance of the intestinal HIF2\u03b1/ferritinophagy axis in systemic iron homeostasis, whole-body and intestine-specific NCOA4-/- mouse lines were generated and assessed. The analyses revealed that the intestinal and systemic response to iron deficiency was not altered after disruption of intestinal NCOA4. However, in a mouse model of hemochromatosis, ablation of intestinal NCOA4 was protective against iron overload. Therefore, NCOA4 can be selectively targeted for the management of iron overload disorders without disrupting the physiological processes involved in the response to systemic iron deficiency.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia", "Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Enterocytes", "Hemochromatosis", "Iron", "Iron Overload", "Mice", "Nuclear Receptor Coactivators", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nupur K", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Chesta", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Sankar", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Naiara", "Last Name": "Santana-Codina", "Affiliation": "Division of Radiation and Genome Stability, Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and."}, {"First Name": "Sumeet", "Last Name": "Solanki", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoya", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Sanjana", "Last Name": "Parimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Liangyou", "Last Name": "Rui", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Mancias", "Affiliation": "Division of Radiation and Genome Stability, Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and."}, {"First Name": "Yatrik M", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2022Apr21"}, {"PMID": "34989467", "Title": "Hydrogen-Bonded Metal-Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton.", "Abstract": "Xe/Kr separation is an industrially important but challenging process owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air.

Healthy subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a093; 37 males; aged 50-85\u2009years) were recruited.

Here, we conducted a follow-up study of 29 naive TB patients who received first-line anti-TB drug treatment; we collected their fecal samples at different time points, as well as 22 fecal samples from healthy subjects. Fungal ITS2 and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the effects of active TB and anti-TB treatment on the gut microbiota. We found that naive TB patients had bacterial and fungal dysbiosis with altered community composition and a decreased density of the transkingdom correlation network. Anti-TB drug treatment significantly decreased the diversity of bacteria and fungi with altered composition. Notably, we observed that the abundance of Purpureocillium lilacinum tended to decrease and Nakaseomyces spp. tended to increase in the anti-TB treatment, and all of them had increased proportions in the three TB groups compared with healthy subjects. We found that the fungal-bacterial transkingdom network was severely altered in TB patients after 2 months of treatment, and new fungal-enriched connections that were not observed in other groups after 6 months of treatment. This study provides the first detailed analysis of dysbiosis of the gut mycobiota due to active TB and anti-TB treatment. The results suggest that fungi play an important role in the balance of the gut microbiota and may be associated with the progression of TB, influencing the microbiota and immunity homeostasis in those receiving anti-TB treatment. IMPORTANCE Numerous studies have shown that the gut bacterial microbiota is altered in active TB patients and that anti-TB drugs have profound and long-term impacts. However, as an integral part of the microbiota, fungi have rarely been studied. The need to investigate both the bacterial and fungal microbiota, as well as the relationship between them is apparent. The significance of our study is in our examination of the changes in the bacterial and fungal microbiota simultaneously in both active TB and patients receiving anti-TB treatment. We found that fungi play an important role in the bacterial-fungal transkingdom network, especially during the anti-TB therapy. These findings underscore the importance of fungi in gut microbiota dysbiosis during active TB and anti-TB treatment processes. In addition, our findings suggest it is meaningful to research potential adjunctive therapies that reduce fungal expansion and increase commensal bacterial abundance after anti-TB treatment, which would help the recovery of TB patients.", "Keywords": ["anti-tuberculosis treatment", "gut mycobiota", "pulmonary tuberculosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antitubercular Agents", "Bacteria",

Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a class of highly hydrophilic proteins and have been reported to protect various cells from water stress. However, whether LEA proteins exert protective effects on ovarian tissue cryopreservation remains unknown. To investigate the benefit of LEA proteins in ovarian tissue cryopreservation, we purified the recombinant AavLEA1 protein, a member of Group 3 LEA proteins, then cryopreserved the mouse ovaries with this protein by vitrification, and obtained the ovarian follicle structure, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and GAPDH gene expression of postcryopreservation ovaries. We found that recombinant AavLEA1 protein protected the ovarian follicles from cryoinjury, improved the proliferative ability of follicles, decreased the apoptosis, and promoted the GAPDH gene expression.

Actually, perception of external sensory stimulation requires complex interactions among distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the interactions among these regions elicited by nociceptive pain remain unclear, which limits our understanding of mechanisms of pain from a brain network perspective. Task fMRI data were collected with a random sequence of intermixed stimuli of four sensory modalities in 80 healthy subjects. Whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis was performed to identify task-modulated functional connectivity (FC) patterns for each modality. Task-modulated FC strength and graph-theoretical-based network properties were compared among the four modalities. Lastly, we performed across-sensory-modality prediction analysis based on the whole-brain task-modulated FC patterns to confirm the specific relationship between brain patterns and sensory modalities. For each sensory modality, task-modulated FC patterns were distributed over widespread brain regions beyond those typically activated or deactivated during the stimulation. As compared with the other three sensory modalities, nociceptive stimulation exhibited significantly different patterns (more widespread and stronger FC within the cingulo-opercular network, between cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks, between cingulo-opercular and emotional networks, and between default mode and emotional networks) and global property (smaller modularity). Further, a cross-sensory-modality prediction analysis found that task-modulated FC patterns could predict sensory modality at the subject level successfully.

Previous studies have revealed that sugar transporters, plasmodesmata and sieve plates act as important controllers in sucrose loading into and unloading from phloem in the vascular system. However, other pivotal steps for the regulation of sucrose movement remain largely elusive. In this study, characterization of two starch excesses in mesophyll (sem) mutants and dye and sucrose export assays were performed to provide insights into the regulatory networks that drive source-sink relations in rice. Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis. Subcellular localization in rice showed that SEM1 localized to the plasma membrane. In situ expression analysis and GUS staining showed that SEM1 was mainly expressed in vascular phloem cells. Reduced sucrose transport was found in the sem1-1/1-2 mutant, which led to excessive starch accumulation in source leaves and inhibited photosynthesis. Paraffin section and transmission electron microscopy experiments revealed that less-developed vascular cells (VCs) in sem1-1/1-2 potentially disturbed sugar movement. Moreover, dye and sugar trafficking experiments revealed that aberrant VC development was the main reason for the pleiotropic phenotype of sem1-1/1-2.

Here, in order to delve into the effect of flexible side chains of small molecule donors on the photovoltaic properties of SM-OSCs, we synthesized two new small molecule donors substituted by different flexible alkyl chains (iso-octyl chains for SM1-EH and n-octyl chains for SM1-Oct). As a result, the two small molecules present different absorption properties, energy levels, and stacking characteristics. When blending with Y6 as an acceptor, the SM1-Oct-based SM-OSC demonstrated a higher PCE value of 11.73%, while the SM1-EH-based device presents a relatively poorer PCE value of 8.42%. In addition, the morphology analysis demonstrated that, compared with the SM1-EH:Y6 blend, the SM1-Oct:Y6 blend film displayed better molecular stacking properties with stronger multilevel diffraction and preferable phase separation, resulting in the higher hole mobility, more efficient charge separation efficiency, and better device performance.

Upon binding the unacetylated DBD, Dicer is recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, where it represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, upon DNA damage, Dicer-mediated repression is abrogated by stress-induced acetylation at the DBD of p53. Notably, the inability of acetylation-defective p53-3KR in transcription is partially but significantly restored upon loss of Dicer expression.

From CSeT-IC to the atom regioisomer of CTSe-IC and to the conjugated skeleton isomer of SeCT-IC, the optical band gap of neat films continuously reduced and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) gradually upshifted with changing the selenophene from relatively outer position to the outermost position and to the innermost position of the central core. More importantly, the single-crystal structure and the GIWAXS measurements revealed that CTSe-IC presents the closest \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking distance, the largest CCL, and the best molecular order and crystallinity, which led to the highest electron mobility in neat films. Furthermore, the J71:CTSe-IC blend film presents a more ordered film morphology with more proper phase separation domain size, more dominant face-on orientation, and relatively higher and more balanced electron-hole mobilities in comparison with that of J71:SeCT-IC and J71:CSeT-IC. Consequently, the J71:CTSe-IC-based organic solar cell gave a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.59%, which was obviously higher than those for J71:SeCT-IC (10.89%) and J71:CSeT-IC (8.52%).

via a Strong Interlayer Electrostatic Interaction.", "Abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) tin halide perovskites have recently emerged as very promising materials for eco-friendly lead-free photovoltaic devices. However, the fine control of the bulky organic cations orderly embedding into the perovskite structure with a narrow quantum-well width distribution and favorable orientation is rather complicated. In this study, we proposed to introduce the F-substituted phenylethlammonium (PEA) cation (i.e., 4-fluorophenethylammonium FPEA) in 2D tin halide perovskite, which may mitigate phase polydispersity and crystal orientation, thus potentially increasing attainable charge-carrier mobility. A strong interlayer electrostatic attraction between electron-deficient F atoms and its adjacent phenyl rings aligns the crystal structure, working together with the validated dipole interaction. Therefore, the fluorination of organic cation leads to orderly self-assembly of solvated intermediates and promotes vertical crystal orientation. Furthermore, the interlayer electrostatic interaction serves as a supramolecular anchor to stabilize the 2D tin halide perovskite structure. Our work uncovers the effect of interlayer molecular interaction on efficiency and stability, which contributes to the development of stable and efficient low-toxicity perovskite solar cells.", "Keywords": ["crystal orientation", "interlayer electrostatic interaction", "phase distribution", "two-dimensional Sn-based perovskite"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, P.

Machine learning (ML) is widely applied in the failure management of optical networks, where neural networks (NNs) have particularly attracted considerable attention and become the most extensively applied algorithm among all MLs. However, the black-box nature of NN makes it difficult to interpret or analyze why and how NNs work during execution. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware failure detection scheme for optical transport network (OTN) boards, adopting the interpretable extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. According to the feature importance ranking by XGBoost, the high-relevance features with the equipment failure are found. Then, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to solve the inconsistency of feature attribution under three common global feature importance measurement parameters of XGBoost, and can obtain a consistent feature attribution by calculating the contribution (SHAP value) of each input feature to detection result of XGBoost. Based on the feature importance ranking of SHAP values, the features most related to two types of OTN board failures are confirmed, enabling the identification of failure causes. Moreover, we evaluate the failure detection performance for two types of OTN boards, in which the practical data are balanced and unbalanced respectively. Experimental results show that the F1 score of the two types of OTN boards based on the proposed scheme is higher than 98%, and the most relevant features of the two types of board failures are confirmed based on SHAP value, which are the average and maximum values of the environment temperature, respectively.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Danshi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lingling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luyao", "Last Name": "Guan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Optics express", "PubDate": "2021Sep27"}, {"PMID": "34614771", "Title": "GPR-based high-precision passive-support fiber ice coating detection method for power transmission lines.", "Abstract": "A novel monitoring method based on fiber Bragg grating sensor for detecting the ice coating on power transmission lines is proposed and demonstrated in this study.

However, discrimination between SCD, MCI and healthy subjects accurately remains challenging. This paper proposes an auto-weighted centralised multi-task (AWCMT) learning framework for differential diagnosis of SCD and MCI. AWCMT is based on structural and functional connectivity information inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To be specific, we devise a novel multi-task learning algorithm to combine neuroimaging functional and structural connective information. We construct a functional brain network through a sparse and low-rank machine learning method, and also a structural brain network via fibre bundle tracking. Those two networks are constructed separately and independently. Multi-task learning is then used to identify features integration of functional and structural connectivity. Hence, we can learn each task's significance automatically in a balanced way. By combining the functional and structural information, the most informative features of SCD and MCI are obtained for diagnosis. The extensive experiments on the public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains better performance in classifying SCD, MCI and healthy people than traditional algorithms. The newly proposed method has good interpretability as it is able to discover the most disease-related brain regions and their connectivity.

Here, a leaching experiment was carried out using soil(CK-T), pig manure(PM-T), cow manure(CM-T), and chicken manure(CHM-T) with the addition of tetracyclines(tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline) and a control group(without antibiotics). The effects of different sources of manure on soil physical and chemical indicators and bacterial abundance under simulated leaching conditions were studied, while the migration of tetracyclines in the different treatments were also determined. The results showed that compared with the CHM-T and CM-T treatments, the tetracyclines in the PM-T treatment were more easily accumulated in the soil(residual amounts=0.90-6.91 mg\u00b7kg-1 compared to the other treatments=0.33-4.42 mg\u00b7kg-1). Compared with the surface soil(0-4 cm), higher concentrations of tetracyclines were detected at soil depths of 16-24 cm. Consistent with the residues of antibiotics, the concentrations of TN and NH4+-N in the soil with the PM-T treatment were increased by 0.044 g\u00b7kg-1 and 14.11 mg\u00b7kg-1, respectively, which were significantly higher than other treatments. The abundance of bacteria in the soil was reduced due to the bactericidal effect of antibiotics, by 39.66% in the PM-T treatment, which was significantly higher than in the other treatments(12.38%-35.26%). Compared with other treatments, the antibiotics in the CHM-T treatment were more easily leached from the soil, with 9.91 mg of antibiotics in the leachate, which was significantly higher than the other treatments(P<0.05). TN, NH4+-N, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline were the first principal component factors, accounting for 54.55% of the variation, and corresponding concentrations increased with soil depth.

Drugs and numerous endogenous/exogenous agents are metabolized/detoxified by hepatocytes, during which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a by-product. ROS has broad adverse effects on liver function and integrity, including damaging hepatocyte proteins, lipids, and DNA and promoting liver inflammation and fibrosis. ROS in concert with iron overload drives ferroptosis. Hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-inducing kinase (NIK) is aberrantly activated in a broad spectrum of liver disease. NIK phosphorylates and activates inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase subunit alpha (IKK\u03b1), and the hepatic NIK/IKK\u03b1 cascade suppresses liver regeneration. However, the NIK/IKK\u03b1 pathway has not been explored in drug-induced liver injury. Here, we identify hepatic NIK as a previously unrecognized mediator for acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure. APAP treatment increased both NIK transcription and NIK protein stability in primary hepatocytes as well as in liver in mice. Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK augmented APAP-induced liver oxidative stress in mice and increased hepatocyte death and mortality in a ROS-dependent manner. Conversely, hepatocyte-specific ablation of NIK or IKK\u03b1 mitigated APAP-elicited hepatotoxicity and mortality. NIK increased lipid peroxidation and cell death in APAP-stimulated primary hepatocytes. Pretreatment with antioxidants or ferroptosis inhibitors blocked NIK/APAP-induced hepatocyte death.

EEGFuseNet is trained in an unsupervised manner, and deep EEG features covering both spatial and temporal dynamics are automatically characterized. Comparing to the existing features, the characterized deep EEG features could be considered to be more generic and independent of any specific EEG task. The performance of the extracted deep and low-dimensional features by EEGFuseNet is carefully evaluated in an unsupervised emotion recognition application based on three public emotion databases. The results demonstrate the proposed EEGFuseNet is a robust and reliable model, which is easy to train and performs efficiently in the representation and fusion of dynamic EEG features. In particular, EEGFuseNet is established as an optimal unsupervised fusion model with promising cross-subject emotion recognition performance.

Sensory motor rhythm (SMR) NFB protocol has been applied to improve cognitive performance, but a large proportion of participants failed to self-regulate their brain activities and could not benefit from NFB training. Therefore, it is important to identify the neural predictors of SMR up-regulation NFB training performance for a better understanding the mechanisms of individual difference in SMR NFB. Twenty-seven healthy participants (12 males, age: 23.1 \u00b1 2.36) were enrolled to complete three sessions of SMR up-regulation NFB training and collection of multimodal neuroimaging data [resting-state EEG, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)]. Correlation analyses were performed between within-session NFB learning index and anatomical and functional brain features extracted from multimodal neuroimaging data, in order to identify the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological predictors for NFB learning performance. Lastly, machine learning models were trained to predict NFB learning performance using features from each modality as well as multimodal features. According to our results, most participants were able to successfully increase the SMR power and the NFB learning performance was significantly correlated with a set of neuroimaging features, including resting-state EEG powers, gray/white matter volumes from MRI, regional and functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state fMRI. Importantly, results of prediction analysis indicate that NFB learning index can be better predicted using multimodal features compared with features of single modality. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of multimodal neuroimaging technique as a tool to explain the individual difference in within-session NFB learning performance, and could provide a theoretical framework for early identification of individuals who cannot benefit from NFB training.", "Keywords": ["functional connectivity (FC)", "learning", "multimodal neuroimaging", "neurofeedback (NFB)", "sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Yinxue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Yixuan", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaohui", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Gan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Lijie", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34339109", "Title": "Turn-On Photocatalysis: Creating Lone-Pair Donor-Acceptor Bonds in Organic Photosensitizer to Enhance Intersystem Crossing.", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in developing triplet photosensitizers in terms of implementing photochemical strategies in synthetic chemistry.

We report 86 unique positively selected genes in European dogs, among which is LCT (lactase). LCT encodes lactase, which is fundamental for the digestion of lactose.

The results of two-dimensional site frequency spectrum (2D SFS) support that the mutation is under soft sweep . We inferred that the onset of positive selection of the mutation is shorter than 6,535\u2009years and behind the well-developed dairy economy in central Europe. It increases the expression of LCT by reducing its binding with ZEB1, which would enhance dog's ability to digest milk-based diets.

In the current study, we investigated the function and mechanisms of Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor, in BC pathogenesis and progression. The expression of NRP1 was evaluated using data extracted from GEO and HPA databases and examined in BC cell lines. The effect on proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of BC cells were validated after NRP1 knockdown. After identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by NRP1 silencing, GO/KEGG and IPA\u00ae bioinformatics analyses were performed and specific predicted pathways and targets were confirmed in vitro. Additionally, the co-expressed genes and ceRNA network were predicted using data downloaded from CCLE and TCGA databases, respectively. High expression of NRP1 was observed in BC tissues and cells. NRP1 knockdown promoted apoptosis and suppressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of BC cells. Additionally, after NRP1 silencing the activity of MAPK signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer pathways were predicted by KEGG and IPA\u00ae pathway analysis and validated using western blot in BC cells. NRP1 knockdown also affected various biological functions, including antiviral response, immune response, cell cycle, proliferation and migration of cells, and neovascularisation. Furthermore, the main upstream molecule of the DEGs induced by NRP1 knockdown may be NUPR1, and NRP1 was also the downstream target of NUPR1 and essential for regulation of FOXP3 expression to activate neovascularisation. DCBLD2 was positively regulated by NRP1, and PPAR signaling was significantly associated with low NRP1 expression. We also found that NRP1 was a predicted target of miR-204, miR-143, miR-145, and miR-195 in BC development. Our data provide evidence for the biological function and molecular aetiology of NRP1 in BC and for the first time demonstrated an association between NRP1 and NUPR1, FOXP3, and DCBLD2. Specifically, downregulation of NRP1 contributes to BC progression, which is associated with activation of MAPK signaling and molecular mechanisms involved in cancer pathways.

However, the incidence of TLE6 variants in patients with preimplantation embryonic lethality is not fully understood. In this study, we identified four patients carrying novel biallelic TLE6 variants in a cohort of 28 patients with preimplantation embryonic lethality by whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, accounting for 14.29% (4/28) of the cohort. Immunofluorescence showed that the TLE6 levels in oocytes from patients were much lower than in normal control oocytes, suggesting that the variants result in the lower expression of the TLE6 protein in oocytes.

One attractive model is that these mutations sequester histone methyltransferases, but genome-wide studies show that mutant histones and histone methyltransferases often do not colocalize. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), here, we show that, in fission yeast, even though H3K9M-containing nucleosomes are broadly distributed across the genome, the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 is mainly sequestered at pericentric repeats. This selective sequestration of Clr4 depends not only on H3K9M but also on H3K14 ubiquitylation (H3K14ub), a modification deposited by a Clr4-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In\u00a0vitro, H3K14ub synergizes with H3K9M to interact with Clr4 and potentiates the inhibitory effects of H3K9M on Clr4 enzymatic activity.

In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment on 80 healthy participants, with the aim to determine whether there are certain brain regions that specifically or preferentially respond to nociceptive stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four sensory modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we found different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and cingulate gyrus, play different functional roles in the processing of nociceptive stimulation.

Here we describe the enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA (eSPAN) method to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and their modifications at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Briefly, cells are pulsed with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine to label newly synthesized DNA. After cell permeabilization, the target proteins are sequentially bound by antibodies and protein A-fused transposase, which digests and tags genomic DNA of interest once activated by magnesium. The strand specificity is preserved through oligo-replacement. Finally, the resulting double-strand DNA is denatured and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine to enrich nascent DNA associated with proteins of interest. After PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, the mapped reads are used to calculate the relative enrichment of the target proteins around replication origins. Compared with alternative methods, the eSPAN protocol is simple, cost-effective and sensitive, even in a relatively small number of mammalian cells.

Increasing evidence has suggested the potential roles of melatonin in protecting granulosa cells from oxidative injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we demonstrated that suppression of FOXO1 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was engaged in melatonin-mediated protection against oxidative damage in human granulosa cells upon DON exposure in vitro. DON induced excess reactive oxygen species accumulation, cells viability loss, reduced estradiol-17\u03b2, and progesterone production in human granulosa cells, whereas melatonin ameliorated these phenotypes. Next, we found that the protective effect of melatonin against apoptosis was via reducing ER stress because the inhibition of ER stress displayed similar protective effects during DON treatment. Moreover, melatonin provided no additional protection when ER stress was inhibited. We further found that FOXO1 is a pivotal downstream effector of melatonin and ER stress in regulating DON-induced apoptosis in human granulosa cells. Blocking of FOXO1 reduced DON-induced cells death and FOXO1 activation could be suppressed by melatonin or ER stress inhibitor.

Through a 4-year field study, we evaluated the phytoextraction efficiency of Populus deltoides CL. 'Xianglin 90' grown on a mine tailing co-polluted by Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the rhizospheric soil were reduced by amounts ranging from 12.86 to 42.19% during the study period. Bioconcentration factors and translocation factors showed that the accumulation of Cd and Zn occurring in the shoots was the most effective. Combined with the considerable biomass produced by poplar, the extracted amounts of Cd and Zn could reach 0.61 g and 10.66 g plant-1, respectively, in which the shoots account for 77.3% (Cd) and 89.0% (Zn) of the overall extraction amounts. Acid-soluble Cd and Zn increased by 5.49% and 4.29%, respectively, in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil, indicating that poplar enhanced the mobility of Cd and Zn in the rhizosphere, which explained its ability for bioaccumulation and root-shoot translocation.

The bimolecular recombination of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes may cause nonradiative loss by forming the low-lying triplet excited states (T1) via the intermediate charge-transfer triplet states. Here, we show that such a spin-related loss channel can be suppressed in the OPV blends with fluorinated nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). By combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and triplet sensitization measurements, the T1 states at the acceptors have been observed to generate from the charge-separated electrons and holes in the OPV blends with a same polymer donor and two sets of NFAs with and without fluorination. The triplet formation is largely suppressed and the lifetime of charge carrier is markedly prolonged in the blends with fluorinated NFAs. The fluorination effect on the charge dynamics can be ascribed to the modified energy alignment between the triplet excited states of charge-transfer and locally excited characters as supported by quantum chemical computation. Our findings explain the mechanism responsible for the improved photocurrent generation in the OPV blends with fluorinated NFAs, suggesting that manipulating the energy landscape of triplet excited states is a promising strategy for further optimizing OPV devices.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianqiu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Lulu", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry of MOE, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunfeng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenkai", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Guo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongfang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry of MOE, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2021Mar24"}, {"PMID": "33692998", "Title": "Single-Cell RNA Sequencing With Combined Use of Bulk RNA Sequencing to Reveal Cell Heterogeneity and Molecular Changes at Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke in Mouse Cortex Penumbra Area.", "Abstract": "Stroke has been the leading cause of adult morbidity and mortality over the past several years. After an ischemic stroke attack, many dormant or reversibly injured brain cells exist in the penumbra area. However, the pathological processes and unique cell information in the penumbra area of an acute ischemic stroke remain elusive. We applied unbiased single cell sequencing in combination with bulk RNA-seq analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of each cell type in the early stages of ischemic stroke and to detect early possible therapeutic targets to help cell survival. We used these analyses to study the mouse brain penumbra during this phase. Our results reveal the impact of ischemic stroke on specific genes and pathways of different cell types and the alterations of cell differentiation trajectories, suggesting potential pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In addition to classical gene markers, single-cell genomics demonstrates unique information on subclusters of several cell types and metabolism changes in an ischemic stroke. These findings suggest that Gadd45b in microglia, Cyr61 in astrocytes, and Sgk3 in oligodendrocytes may play a subcluster-specific role in cell death or survival in the early stages of ischemic stroke. Moreover, RNA-scope multiplex in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence staining were applied to selected target gene markers to validate and confirm the existence of these cell subtypes and molecular changes during acute stage of ischemic stroke.", "Keywords": ["brain cortex penumbra", "cell survival", "general transcriptome", "ischemic stroke", "microglia", "single-cell sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, West Theater General Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Dayun", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of The Central Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, West Theater General Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xun", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenxing", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Yixuan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenwei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33678320", "Title": "Comprehensive assessment of a clinic's experience of preimplantation genetic testing by a cumulative rate.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of patients who had preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal structural rearrangement (PGT-SR) or for aneuploidy screening (PGT-A) with different indications.", "Keywords": ["Aneuploidy", "PGT-A", "PGT-SR", "Pregnancy outcomes", "Preimplantation genetic testing"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aneuploidy", "Embryo Transfer", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Live Birth", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Rate", "Preimplantation Diagnosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Sex Chromosome Aberrations", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinyuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Reproductive Medicine Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No 218 Jixi Road, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, China;

The highly porous structure of MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H enables the free access of reactants to the catalytic active sites inside MOF pores. Kinetic studies indicated that the Cr sites of MOF accelerate the rate-limiting autoxidation reaction of xanthene, which synergistically work with the sulfonic acid group on MOF ligands in promoting the CDC reactions. Besides, the catalytic system shows excellent functional group compatibility, and a variety of valuable xanthene derivatives were synthesized with satisfactory yields.

Literature has shown that pain sensitivity is associated with regional structural features of the brain, but it remains unclear whether pain sensitivity is also related to structural brain connectivity. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between pain thresholds and morphological connectivity (MC) inferred from structural MRI based on data of 221 healthy participants. We found that MC was highly predictive of an individual's pain thresholds and, importantly, it had a better prediction performance than regional structural features. We also identified a number of most predictive MC features and confirmed the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in the determination of pain sensitivity. These results suggest the potential of using structural MRI-based MC to predict an individual's pain sensitivity in clinical settings, and hence this study has important implications for diagnosis and

"Title": "Enhanced control of sulfonamide resistance genes and host bacteria during thermophilic aerobic composting of cow manure.", "Abstract": "Traditional composting has already shown a certain effect in eliminating antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). It is worth noting that the rebounding of ARGs and the succession of the bacterial community during conventional aerobic composting are still serious threats. Considering the probable risk, improved and adaptable technologies are urgently needed to control antibiotic resistance efficiently. This study monitored how thermophilic aerobic composting affected the ARGs, as well as the bacterial diversity during the composting of cow manure spiked with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) at different concentrations. Results showed that the degradation of SMX was enhanced during thermophilic aerobic composting (control\u00a0>\u00a0SMX25\u00a0>\u00a0SMX50\u00a0>\u00a0SMX100) and was no longer detected after 20 days of composting. High temperature or heat significantly stimulated the rebounding of certain genes. After 35 days, the abundance of detected genes (sul2, sulA, dfrA7, and dfrA1) significantly decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in control and antibiotic-spiked treatments, except for sul1. The addition of three concentrations of SMX elicited a sharp effect on bacterial diversity, and microbial structure in SMX25 led to significant differences with others (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The network analysis revealed more rigorous interactions among ARGs and abundant genera, suggesting that the host of ARGs potentially increased at low concentrations of SMX. Especially, genera g_norank_f__Beggiatoaceae, Ruminiclostridium, Caldicoprobacter, g_norank_o_MBA03, Hydrogenispora, and Ruminiclostridium_1 were major potential hosts for sul1. In conclusion, the rebounding of ARGs could be intermitted partially, and more efficient control of antibiotic resistance could be achieved in the thermophilic composting compared to conventional methods.", "Keywords": ["Potential carriers", "Rebounding", "Sulfamethoxazole", "Sulfonamide resistance genes", "Thermophilic temperature"], "MeSH terms": ["Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteria", "Cattle", "Composting", "Genes, Bacterial", "Manure", "Sulfonamides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad Fahad", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Changxiong", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yali", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "College of Environment Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Hebei, 050000, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bilawal", "Last Name": "Abbasi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hongna", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Agricultural Clean Watershed Research Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, PR China.

In this study, we investigated whether SDT could also be applied to treat more advanced hemorrhagic plaque and addressed the underlying mechanism. SDT decreased atherosclerotic burden, positively altered atherosclerotic lesion composition, and alleviated iron retention in rabbit hemorrhagic plaques. Furthermore, SDT reduced iron retention by stimulating ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) expression in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mouse plaques with high susceptibility to IPH. Subsequently, SDT inhibited iron-overload-induced foam-cell formation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in vitro. Moreover, SDT reduced levels of the labile iron pool and ferritin expression via the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-FPN1 pathway. SDT exerted therapeutic effects on hemorrhagic plaques and reduced iron retention via the ROS-Nrf2-FPN1 pathway in macrophages, thereby suggesting that it is a potential translational strategy for patients with advanced atherosclerosis in clinical practice.", "Keywords": ["ferroportin 1", "intraplaque hemorrhage", "iron", "macrophage", "sonodynamic therapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bicheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Medicine Research (Harbin Medical University), Ministry of Education Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Siqi", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Minqiao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Medicine Research (Harbin Medical University), Ministry of Education Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Shuyuan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jianting", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Haiyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xuezhu", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengyu", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yongxing", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Medicine Research (Harbin Medical University), Ministry of Education Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Institute of Acoustics Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Materials and Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Instrumentation Science and Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Molecular Vascular Medicine, Medicine Department Karolinska University Hospital Solna Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Cardiovascular Institute Harbin Medical University Harbin People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "Bioengineering & translational medicine", "PubDate": "2021Jan"}, {"PMID": "33531068", "Title": "Perioperative risk factors for recovery room delirium after elective non-cardiovascular surgery under general anaesthesia.", "Abstract": "Although postoperative delirium is a frequent complication of surgery, little is known about risk factors for delirium occurring in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).

We used scanning electron microscope and optical microscope to find that there were obvious fungal structures in exposed wood and wood storing water samples. High-throughput sequencing of fungi revealed that the most abundant genera in exposed and soaked wood were Fusarium sp., and Scedosporium sp., respectively. In addition, Fusarium solani and Scedosporium apiospermum were successfully isolated from the hull wood surface and wood storing water samples, and the degradation tests of lignin and cellulose, the sensitivity tests of biocides and growth curve assay were carried out.

Human MOF (males absent on the first) is a histone acetyltransferase that is globally downregulated in human steatohepatitis. However, the function of MOF in the liver remains unclear. Here, we report that MOF plays an essential role in adult liver. Genetic deletion of Mof by Mx1-Cre in the liver leads to acute liver injury, with increase of lipid deposition and fibrosis akin to human steatohepatitis. Surprisingly, hepatocyte-specific Mof deletion had no overt liver abnormality. Using the in\u00a0vitro coculturing experiment, we show that Mof deletion-induced liver injury requires coordinated changes and reciprocal signaling between hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, which enables feedforward regulation to augment inflammation and apoptotic responses. At the molecular level, Mof deletion induced characteristic changes in metabolic gene programs, which bore noticeable similarity to the molecular signature of human steatohepatitis. Simultaneous deletion of Mof in both hepatocytes and macrophages results in enhanced expression of inflammatory genes and NO signaling in\u00a0vitro. These changes, in turn, lead to apoptosis of hepatocytes and lipotoxicity.

Their efficiency in acetylene/ethylene separation is confirmed by breakthrough experiments, giving excellent ethylene productivities (121\u2009mmol/g from 1/99 mixture, 99.9999%), even when cycled under moist conditions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Rajamani", "Last Name": "Krishna", "Affiliation": "Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jasper M", "Last Name": "van Baten", "Affiliation": "Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Rundao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Zongbi", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Huabin", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Mircea", "Last Name": "Dinc\u01ce", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiwei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China. yangqw@zju.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Qilong", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, 310027, Hangzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2020Dec07"}, {"PMID": "33274466", "Title": "Melatonin improves the effect of cryopreservation on human oocytes by suppressing oxidative stress and maintaining the permeability of the oolemma.", "Abstract": "Cryopreservation causes cryoinjury to oocytes and impairs their developmental competence. Melatonin (MLT) can improve the effect of cryopreservation in animal oocytes. However, no such studies on human oocytes have been reported. In this study, collected in vitro-matured human oocytes were randomly divided into the following groups: fresh group, MLT-treated cryopreservation (MC) group, and no-MLT-treated cryopreservation (NC) group. After vitrification and warming, viable oocytes from these three groups were assessed for their mitochondrial function, ultrastructure, permeability of oolemma, early apoptosis, developmental competence, and cryotolerance-related gene expression. First, fluorescence staining results revealed that oocytes from the 10-9 \u00a0M subgroup showed the lowest intracellular reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ levels and highest mitochondrial membrane potential among the MC subgroups (10-11 , 10-9 , 10-7 , and 10-5 \u00a0M). In subsequent experiments, oocytes from the 10-9 \u00a0M-MC group were observed to maintain the normal ultrastructural features and the permeability of the oolemma. Compared with those of the oocytes in the NC group, the early apoptosis rate significantly decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), whereas both the high-quality cleavage embryo and blastocyst rates significantly increased (both P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in the oocytes of the 10-9 \u00a0M-MC group. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence results revealed that aquaporin (AQP) 1/2/11 gene expression and AQP1 protein expression were upregulated in the MC group.

Focusing on the parietal and occipital lobes, the encoding effects at different alpha frequency bins and brain locations are examined by a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA), and possible links between alpha features and saliency patterns are constructed. The robustness and reliability of the proposed system are demonstrated in a 10-fold cross-validation.

Despite its functions in plant reproductive development, its targets in rice panicles remain unclear. In this study, we used proteome-wide profiling of lysine ubiquitination in rice (O. sativa ssp. indica) young panicles. We created the largest ubiquitinome dataset in rice to date, identifying 1638 lysine ubiquitination sites on 916 unique proteins. We detected three conserved ubiquitination motifs, noting that acidic glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) were most frequently present around ubiquitinated lysine. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of these ubiquitinated proteins revealed that ubiquitination plays an important role in fundamental cellular processes in rice young panicles. Interestingly, enrichment analysis of protein domains indicated that ubiquitination was enriched on a variety of receptor-like kinases and cytoplasmic tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. Furthermore, we analyzed the crosstalk between ubiquitination, acetylation, and succinylation, and constructed a potential protein interaction network within our rice ubiquitinome. Moreover, we identified ubiquitinated proteins related to pollen and grain development, indicating that ubiquitination may play a critical role in the physiological functions in young panicles.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is impeded by a severe shuttle effect. Using polar and conductive materials to prepare a modified separator as the second collector is an effective strategy to solve the shuttle effect. Herein, a Ti3C2T x -PEDOT:PSS hybrid for modifying PP separators is successfully fabricated. In this hybrid, PEDOT:PSS can effectively prevent Ti3C2T x nanosheets from restacking and enhance the electrical conductivity of Li-S batteries, thereby promoting fast Li+/electron transport and improving the sulfur utilization. Meanwhile, the introduction of Ti3C2T x -PEDOT:PSS makes Ti3C2T x nanosheets effectively anchor polysulfide, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect. As a result, Li-S cells with Ti3C2T x -PEDOT:PSS modified-separators exhibit superior performances, including a high discharge capacity of 1241.4 mA h g-1 at 0.2C, a long cycling stability, and a low decay rate of 0.030% per cycle at 0.5C for 1000 cycles.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Normal University Harbin 150025 People's Republic of China xtzhangzhang@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Normal University Harbin 150025 People's Republic of China xtzhangzhang@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Normal University Harbin 150025 People's Republic of China xtzhangzhang@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Chuncheng", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Normal University Harbin 150025 People's Republic of China xtzhangzhang@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Xitian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Photonic and Electronic Bandgap Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Normal University Harbin 150025 People's Republic of China xtzhangzhang@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Condensed Mater Science and Technology Institute, Department of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin 150001 People's Republic of China."}], "Journal": "RSC advances", "PubDate": "2020Nov02"}, {"PMID": "33138300", "Title": "Ratiometric Sensor Based on PtOEP-C6/Poly (St-TFEMA) Film for Automatic Dissolved Oxygen Content Detection.", "Abstract": "A ratiometric oxygen sensor based on a platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP)-coumarin 6 (C6)/poly (styrene-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (poly (St-TFEMA)) film was developed for automatic dissolved oxygen (DO) detection.

The present study proposed a new approach which can design a prediction model specific to each individual or each experimental trial so that the specific model can achieve more accurate prediction of the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI responses. More precisely, the new approach uses a supervised k-means method on nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster individuals or trials into a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and consistent fMRI activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial, the proposed approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has the closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples to train an individual-specific or a trial-specific pain prediction model. The new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset and achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional non-specific models, which used all available training samples to train a model. The generalizability of the proposed approach is further validated by training specific models on one dataset and testing these models on an independent new dataset.

In this study, we investigated the \"signal\" (P300 waveform) and the \"noise\" (averaged eye-blinking artifacts) on a cross-modal long-term EEG recording to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of different methods on ICA eye-blinking artifacts removal. As a result, it was found that, firstly, down sampling is an effective way to reduce the computation time in ICA. Appropriate down sampling ratio could speed up ICA computation 200 times and keep the decomposition performance stable, in which the computation time of ICA decomposition on a 2800 s EEG recording was less than 5 s. Secondly, dimension reduction by PCA was also a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ICA.

Therefore, we investigated whether AMPK\u03b12, the central subunit of AMPK in energy metabolism, is required for SFN protection against DN in T2D, and whether potential cross-talk occurs between AMPK\u03b12 and Nrf2. AMPK\u03b12 knockout (Ampk\u03b12-/-) mice and wildtype (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet (ND) to induce insulin resistance, followed by streptozotocin (STZ) injection to induce hyperglycemia, as a T2D model. Both T2D and control mice were treated with SFN or vehicle for 3 months. At the end of the 3-month treatment, all mice were maintained only on HFD or ND for an additional 3 months without SFN treatment. Mice were killed at sixth month after T2D onset. Twenty-four-hour urine albumin at third and sixth months was significantly increased as renal dysfunction, along with significant renal pathological changes and biochemical changes including renal hypertrophy, oxidative damage, inflammation, and fibrosis in WT T2D mice, which were prevented by SFN in certain contexts, but not in Ampk\u03b12-/- T2D mice. SFN prevention of T2D-induced renal lipotoxicity was associated with AMPK-mediated activation of lipid metabolism and Nrf2-dependent antioxidative function in WT mice, but not in SFN-treated Ampk\u03b12-/- mice. Therefore, SFN prevention of DN is AMPK\u03b12-mediated activation of probably both lipid metabolism and Nrf2 via AMPK/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2/Src family tyrosine kinase (Fyn) pathways.", "Keywords": ["AMPK", "Diabetic Nephropathy", "Nrf2", "Renal Lipotoxicity", "Sulforaphane"], "MeSH terms": ["AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Animals", "Antioxidants", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Fibrosis", "Gene Deletion", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta", "Inflammation", "Isothiocyanates", "Kidney", "Lipid Metabolism", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Models, Biological", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Oxidative Stress", "Protective Agents", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn", "Sulfoxides", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhuo", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Tianjiao", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Shanshan", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Cardiology and Nephrology at The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China."}, {"First Name": "Lining", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephropathy, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130041, China."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Norton Children and University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville 40202, KY, U.S.A."}], "Journal": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "PubDate": "2020Sep30"}, {"PMID": "32923642", "Title": "DNA polymerase \u03b1 interacts with H3-H4 and facilitates the transfer of parental histones to lagging strands.", "Abstract": "How parental histones, the carriers of epigenetic modifications, are deposited onto replicating DNA remains poorly understood.

RESULTS Results of the TCGA analysis showed that TPX2 was significantly positively correlated with tumor metastasis and growth and the clinical stage of NSCLC. In addition, high levels of TPX2 significantly indicated a poor survival rate. In vitro experimental results also revealed that the upregulation of TPX2 significantly promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion and could affect cell replasticity. Further results indicated that TPX2 significantly activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and promoted the expression and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9.

A few modifications have since been made, but there remain misunderstandings on the method, as well as on its relations to a similar method named beta series correlation (BSC). Here, we explain what PPI measures and its relations to BSC. We first clarify that the interpretation of a regressor in a general linear model depends on not only itself but also on how other effects are modeled. In terms of PPI, it always reflects differences in connectivity between conditions, when the physiological variable is included as a covariate. Secondly, when there are multiple conditions, we explain how PPI models calculated from direct contrast between conditions could generate identical results as contrasting separate PPIs of each condition (a.k.a. \"generalized\" PPI). Thirdly, we explicit the deconvolution process that is used for PPI calculation, and how is it related to the trial-by-trial modeling for BSC, and illustrate the relations between PPI and those based upon BSC. In particular, when context sensitive changes in effective connectivity are present, they manifest as changes in correlations of observed trial-by-trial activations or functional connectivity. Therefore, BSC and PPI can detect similar connectivity differences.

Previously, we found that 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated sonodynamic therapy (ALA-SDT) suppressed macrophage-mediated inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. However, the effects on intimal hyperplasia and re-endothelialization remain unknown. In this study, 56 rabbits were randomly assigned to control, ultrasound, ALA and ALA-SDT groups, and each group was divided into two subgroups (n\u2009=\u20097) on day 3 after right femoral artery balloon denudation combined with a hypercholesterolemic\u00a0diet. Histopathological analysis revealed that ALA-SDT enhanced macrophage apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation from day 1. ALA-SDT inhibited neointima formation without affecting re-endothelialization, increased blood perfusion, decreased the content of macrophages, proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and collagen but increased elastin by day 28. In vitro, ALA-SDT induced macrophage apoptosis and reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 via the ROS-PPAR\u03b3-NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, which indirectly inhibited human umbilical artery smooth muscle cell (HUASMC) proliferation, migration and IL-6 production. ALA-SDT effectively inhibits intimal hyperplasia without affecting re-endothelialization.
