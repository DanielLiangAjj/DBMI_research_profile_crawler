[{"PMID": "38701790", "Title": "Genome sequence analyses identify novel risk loci for multiple system atrophy.", "Abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult-onset, sporadic synucleinopathy characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and dysautonomia. The genetic architecture of MSA is poorly understood, and treatments are limited to supportive measures. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequence data from 888 European-ancestry MSA cases and 7,128 controls to systematically investigate the genetic underpinnings of this understudied neurodegenerative disease. We identified four significantly associated risk loci using a genome-wide association study approach. Transcriptome-wide association analyses prioritized USP38-DT, KCTD7, and lnc-KCTD7-2 as novel susceptibility genes for MSA within these loci, and single-nucleus RNA sequence analysis found that the associated variants acted as cis-expression quantitative trait loci for multiple genes across neuronal and glial cell types. In conclusion, this study highlights the role of genetic determinants in the pathogenesis of MSA, and the publicly available data from this study represent a valuable resource for investigating synucleinopathies.", "Keywords": ["GWAS", "MSA", "TWAS", "colocalization", "gene-burden analysis", "genome-wide association study", "multiple system atrophy", "pathway analysis", "repeat expansion mapping", "transcriptome-wide association study", "whole genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Chia", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anindita", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zalak", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinhui", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Group, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Ruffo", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA;

Four individuals with FND participated in 45-minute, one-to-one virtual yoga sessions, two times a week for 8 weeks. We measured outcomes in four domains (healthcare utilization, FND symptoms, quality of life and self-efficacy, and function and mobility) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Assessments included the Psychogenic Movement Disorders Rating Scale, timed up-and-go test, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale. Four participants completed at least 8 sessions, and two completed the full intervention (16 sessions). There were no adverse events. Two participants reported positive changes after yoga and improved on all clinical assessments (timed up-and-go test and Psychogenic Movement Disorders Rating Scale). Postintervention interview analysis revealed three themes: negative diagnosis experience, perceived health effects of yoga, and session format preferences. This was an exploratory case series describing a yoga intervention that was associated with some benefits for people with FND (decreased FND symptom severity and increased function, perceived health, quality of life, and self-efficacy).

At our hospital, door-to-imaging time is comprised of 2 time periods: the time before a stroke is recognized, followed by the period after the stroke code is called during which the stroke team assesses and brings the patient to the computed tomography scanner. To control for delays due to triage, we isolated the time period after a potential stroke has been recognized, as few studies have examined the biases of stroke code responders. This \"code-to-imaging time\" (CIT) encompassed the time from stroke code activation to initial imaging, and we hypothesized that perception of stroke severity would affect how quickly stroke code responders act. In consecutively admitted ischemic stroke patients at The Mount Sinai Hospital emergency department, we tested associations between National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (NIHSS), continuously and at different cutoffs, and CIT using spline regression, t tests for univariate analysis, and multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In our study population, mean CIT was 26 minutes, and mean presentation NIHSS was 8. In univariate and multivariate analyses comparing CIT between mild and severe strokes, stroke scale scores <4 were associated with longer response times. Milder strokes are associated with a longer CIT with a threshold effect at a NIHSS of 4.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Severity of Illness Index", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kimberly T", "Last Name": "Kwei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Tuhrim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mandip", "Last Name": "Dhamoon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "The neurologist", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "28805591", "Title": "Acute Presentation of Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.", "Abstract": "There are a few syndromes involving the nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders that can quickly lead to severe morbidity and mortality, and, as such, need rapid identification and management. Among these are neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome, and dystonic storm. It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for these disorders as lack of identification can lead to death. Many of these acutely occurring nonmotor syndromes are primarily the result of imbalances in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems due to changes in pharmacologic management of psychiatric disorders or Parkinson's disease. We discuss these acutely occurring nonmotor symptoms in order to raise awareness and also to highlight how these extremes in symptoms may uniquely shed light on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.", "Keywords": ["Neuroleptic malignant syndrome", "Parkinson's disease", "Serotonin syndrome"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Dopamine Agents", "Humans", "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome", "Parkinson Disease", "Serotonin Syndrome", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kimberly", "Last Name": "Kwei", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Frucht", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.
