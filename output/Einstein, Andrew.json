Of those, 500 patients from one site were used for model training and validation, with the remaining patients held out for testing (n\u2009=\u20093511 internal testing, n\u2009=\u20094770 external testing). We modified an existing deep learning model to first identify the cardiac silhouette, then automatically segment EAT based on attenuation thresholds. Deep learning EAT measurements were obtained in <2\u2009s compared to 15\u2009min for expert annotations. There was excellent agreement between EAT attenuation (Spearman correlation 0.90 internal, 0.82 external) and volume (Spearman correlation 0.90 internal, 0.91 external) by deep learning and expert segmentation in all 3 sites (Spearman correlation 0.90-0.98). During median follow-up of 2.7 years (IQR 1.6-4.9), 565 patients experienced death or MI. Elevated EAT volume and attenuation were independently associated with an increased risk of death or MI after adjustment for relevant confounders. Deep learning can automatically measure EAT volume and attenuation from low-dose, ungated CT with excellent correlation with expert annotations, but in a fraction of the time. EAT measurements offer additional prognostic insights within the context of hybrid perfusion imaging.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J H", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aakash", "Last Name": "Shanbhag", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aditya", "Last Name": "Killekar", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Lemley", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan", "Last Name": "Bednarski", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge D", "Last Name": "Van Kriekinge", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul B", "Last Name": "Kavanagh", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Attila", "Last Name": "Feher", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward J", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Terrence D", "Last Name": "Ruddy", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Joanna X", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valerie", "Last Name": "Builoff", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel S", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Damini", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Piotr J", "Last Name": "Slomka", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), Imaging and Biomedical Sciences Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Trends in test selection in traditional versus advanced noninvasive tests for CAD during the pandemic and in countries of varying income status have not been well studied. The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a global survey to assess the pandemic-related changes in the practice of cardiovascular diagnostic testing. Site procedural volumes for noninvasive tests to evaluate CAD from March 2019 (prepandemic), April 2020 (onset), and April 2021 (initial recovery) were collected. We considered traditional testing modalities, such as exercise electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, and stress single-photon emission computed tomography, and advanced testing modalities, such as stress cardiac magnetic resonance, coronary computed tomography angiography, and stress positron emission tomography. Survey data were obtained from 669 centers in 107 countries, reporting the performance of 367,933 studies for CAD during the study period. Compared with 2019, traditional tests were performed 14% less frequently (recovery rate 82%) in 2021 versus advanced tests, which were performed 15% more frequently (128% recovery rate). Coronary computed tomography angiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, and stress positron emission tomography showed 14%, 25%, and 25% increases in volumes from 2019 to 2021, respectively. The increase in advanced testing was isolated to high- and upper middle-income countries, with 132% recovery in advanced tests by 2021 compared with 55% in lower income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated economic disparities in CAD testing practice between wealthy and poorer countries. Greater recovery rates and even new growth were observed for advanced imaging modalities; however, this growth was restricted to wealthy countries. Efforts to reduce practice variations in CAD testing because of economic status are warranted.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "cardiac testing", "coronavirus", "health disparities", "health equity"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Angiography", "Pandemics", "COVID-19", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Exercise Test"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Todd C", "Last Name": "Villines", "Affiliation": "University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.

Purpose To assess 5-year cumulative radiation doses of participants undergoing investigation for suspected angina due to coronary artery disease with or without coronary CTA. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of the SCOT-HEART trial included data from six of 12 recruiting sites and two of three imaging sites. Participants were recruited between November 18, 2010, and September 24, 2014, with follow-up through January 31, 2018. Study participants had been randomized (at a one-to-one ratio) to standard care with CT (n = 1466) or standard care alone (n = 1428). Imaging was performed on a 64-detector (n = 223) or 320-detector row scanner (n = 1466). Radiation dose from CT (dose-length product), SPECT (injected activity), and invasive coronary angiography (ICA; kerma-area product) was assessed for 5 years after enrollment. Effective dose was calculated using conversion factors appropriate for the imaging modality and body region imaged (using 0.026 mSv/mGy \u00b7 cm for cardiac CT). Results Cumulative radiation dose was assessed in 2894 participants. Median effective dose was 3.0 mSv (IQR, 2.6-3.3 mSv) for coronary calcium scoring, 4.1 mSv (IQR, 2.6-6.1 mSv) for coronary CTA, 7.4 mSv (IQR, 6.2-8.5 mSv) for SPECT, and 4.1 mSv (IQR, 2.5-6.8 mSv) for ICA. After 5 years, total per-participant cumulative dose was higher in the CT group (median, 8.1 mSv; IQR, 5.5-12.4 mSv) compared with standard-care group (median, 0 mSv; IQR, 0-4.5 mSv; P < .001). In participants who underwent any imaging, cumulative radiation exposure was higher in the CT group (n = 1345; median, 8.6 mSv; IQR, 6.1-13.3 mSv) compared with standard-care group (n = 549; median, 6.4 mSv; IQR, 3.4-9.2 mSv; P < .001). Conclusion In the SCOT-HEART trial, the 5-year cumulative radiation dose from cardiac imaging was higher in the coronary CT angiography group compared with the standard-care group, largely because of the radiation exposure from CT.

We evaluate the use of troponin \"velocity,\" the rate of change of troponin concentration over a flexible short interval for the prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) at 30\u00a0days. We conducted a prospective, observational study on a convenience sample of 821 patients who underwent ACS evaluation at a high-volume, urban ED. We determined the diagnostic performance of a novel velocity-based algorithm and compared the performance of 1- and 2-hour algorithms adapted from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) using delta versus velocity. A total of 7 of 332 patients (2.1%) classified as low risk by the velocity-based algorithm experienced a MACE by 30\u00a0days compared with 35 of 221 (13.8%) of patients classified as greater than low risk, yielding a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.6% to 93.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.9% (95% CI 95.9% to 98.9%). The ESC-derived algorithms using delta or velocity had NPVs ranging from 98.4% (95% CI 96.4% to 99.3%) to 99.6% (95% CI 97.0% to 99.9%) for 30-day MACEs.

Although the V122I (valine to isoleucine substitution at position 122 of the transthyretin protein) variant associated with hereditary ATTR-CM is present in 3.4% of self-identified Black individuals in the United States (or 1.5\u2009million people), the phenotypic penetrance is not known. Methods and Results The SCAN-MP (Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis With Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations) study is a currently accruing prospective multisite study designed to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM using technetium-99m-pyrophosphate imaging in older (\u226560\u2009years of age) self-identified Black and Hispanic individuals with HF. Calculations of the penetrance and prevalence of the V122I allele, along with analyses of functional, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters, were performed for the first 278 Black participants in SCAN-MP. The prevalence of ATTR-CM was 6.8% (95% CI, 4.2-10.5; n=19 cases), of whom 63% were ATTR wild-type. The prevalence of V122I was 6.5% (n=18 carriers), of whom 7 had ATTR-CM, yielding a phenotypic penetrance of 39% (95% CI, 17-64). V122I carriers with ATTR-CM evidenced more advanced HF than carriers without ATTR-CM. Prealbumin concentration was lowest among V122I carriers with ATTR-CM (12.9\u2009mg/dL) versus carriers without ATTR-CM (21.0\u2009mg/dL) and HF controls (25.0\u2009mg/dL, P<0.0001). Conclusions Among older Black individuals with HF and increased left ventricular wall thickness, of those with ATTR-CM, 63% had wild-type, and of those with V122I, the phenotypic penetrance of ATTR-CM was 39% (95% CI, 17-64), suggesting that genotype alone is insufficient for diagnosis. Prealbumin concentration may be useful to identify V122I carriers with ATTR-CM.

However, personalizing predictions to a specific event type and time interval is more challenging. We demonstrate an explainable deep learning model that predicts the time-specific risk separately for all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and revascularization directly from MPI and 15 clinical features. We train and test the model internally using 10-fold hold-out cross-validation (n\u2009=\u200920,418) and externally validate it in three separate sites (n\u2009=\u200913,988) with MACE follow-ups for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.6, 3.6). We evaluate the model using the cumulative dynamic area under receiver operating curve (cAUC). The best model performance in the external cohort is observed for short-term prediction - in the first six months after the scan, mean cAUC for ACS and all-cause death reaches 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.77) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.79), respectively. The model outperforms conventional perfusion abnormality measures at all time points for the prediction of death in both internal and external validations, with improvement increasing gradually over time. Individualized patient explanations are visualized using waterfall plots, which highlight the contribution degree and direction for each feature. This approach allows the derivation of individual event probability as a function of time as well as patient- and event-specific risk explanations that may help draw attention to modifiable risk factors.

Misfolding and deposition of transthyretin or prealbumin protein causes ATTR-CM in the context of a normal (wild-type) or variant TTR sequence. Variant ATTR-CM is most commonly caused by the substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 122 in transthyretin (Val122Ile or pV142I, almost exclusively observed in individuals of West African ancestry), demonstrated in 3.4% of self-identified Black individuals in the United States with an estimated 1.5\u2009million carriers. Despite the large number of known pV142I carriers, the proportion of older Black patients with heart failure attributable to ATTR-CM remains unknown. Methods To address this knowledge gap, the SCAN-MP (Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis with Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations) study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL139671) to enroll a targeted population of self-identified, community-dwelling Black or Caribbean Hispanic patients (many of whom are of West African ancestry) >60\u2009years of age with heart failure and identify ATTR-CM by noninvasive nuclear imaging. The principal objective of SCAN-MP is to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM in this population. Secondary objectives will explore TTR genotype, demographics, progression of variant versus wild-type ATTR-CM, and biochemical mechanisms of transthyretin amyloid fibril formation. Conclusions The SCAN-MP study is the largest, prospective study of cardiac amyloidosis in Black and Hispanic individuals. Both wild-type and variant ATTR-CM are now treatable with the US Food and Drug-approved drug tafamidis. The insights gained from SCAN-MP are likely to improve those at risk for or afflicted with ATTR-CM.

has been found capable of detecting a decrease in radial strain caused by ischemia or infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as in a canine model. Prior studies have focused on rest imaging, but stress testing can reveal functional deficits caused by stenoses that are asymptomatic at rest. Therefore, it has been proposed that stress ME (S-ME) improves the detection of CAD. A novel strain difference (\u0394\u03b5) metric is presented and investigated in a canine model of induced ischemia, as well as in a study in human patients with CAD validated by myocardial perfusion imaging. In the canine model study, flow-limiting stenosis was induced by partial ligation in n\u00a0=\u00a02 canines, and stenosis was found to consistently reduce \u0394\u03b5 in the affected myocardial regions compared with baseline, as well as compared to myocardial regions that are remote to the induced stenosis. In the clinical study, the median \u0394\u03b5 was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in infarcted myocardial regions (-6.29%) than in those with normal perfusion (4.62%), with \u0394\u03b5 in ischemic regions falling in between (-2.91%). The same trend was observed when considering radial strain during stress and, to a lesser degree, at rest alone.

Distinguishing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction caused by transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is critical given its specific treatment. We analyzed a single-center retrospective cohort to determine the association of body mass index (BMI) with a composite of either ATTR-CA or the valine-to-isoleucine substitution (Val122Ile) variant genotype (ATTR-CA+Val122Ile). These BMI differences were prospectively evaluated in the multicenter Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis using nuclear imaging for Minority Populations (SCAN-MP) study of Black and Hispanic patients with heart failure. The association of BMI with ATTR-CA+Val122Ile was compared by Wilcoxon rank sum analysis and combined with age, gender, and maximum left ventricle wall thickness in multivariable logistic regression. In the retrospective analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0469), ATTR-CA+Val122Ile was identified in n\u00a0=\u00a0198 (40%), who had a lower median BMI (25.8 kg/m2, interquartile range [IQR] 23.4 to 28.9) than other patients (27.1 kg/m2, IQR 23.9 to 32.0) (p <0.001). In multivariable logistic regression, BMI <30 kg/m2 (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5) remained independently associated with ATTR-CA+Val122Ile with a greater association in Black and Hispanic patients (odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 19.6). In SCAN-MP (n\u00a0=\u00a0201), 17 (8%) had either ATTR-CA (n\u00a0=\u00a010) or were Val122Ile carriers (n\u00a0=\u00a07) with negative pyrophosphate scans. BMI was lower (25.4 kg/m2 [IQR 24.3 to 28.2]) in ATTR-CA+Val122Ile patients than in non-amyloid patients (32.7 kg/m2 [28.3 to 38.6]) (p <0.001), a finding that persisted in multivariable analysis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In conclusion, lower BMI is associated with ATTR-CA+Val122Ile in heart failure with increased left ventricle wall thickness, particularly in Black and Hispanic patients, and may aid in the identification of those benefiting from ATTR-CA evaluation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiomyopathies", "Heart Diseases", "Heart Failure", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Prealbumin", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Poterucha", "Affiliation": "Seymour, Paul and Gloria Milstein Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Damian", "Last Name": "Kurian", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Harlem Hospital Center.

Obstructive CAD, defined as stenosis \u226550% in the left main artery or \u226570% in other coronary segments, was present in half of the patients. We used an explainable DL model (CAD-DL), which was previously developed in a separate population from different sites. Three physicians interpreted studies first with clinical history, stress, and quantitative perfusion, then with all the data plus the DL results. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Results: In total, 240 patients with a median age of 65 y (interquartile range 58-73) were included. The diagnostic accuracy of physician interpretation with CAD-DL (AUC 0.779) was significantly higher than that of physician interpretation without CAD-DL (AUC 0.747, P = 0.003) and stress total perfusion deficit (AUC 0.718, P < 0.001). With matched specificity, CAD-DL had higher sensitivity when operating autonomously compared with readers without DL results (P < 0.001), but not compared with readers interpreting with DL results (P = 0.122). All readers had numerically higher accuracy with CAD-DL, with AUC improvement 0.02-0.05, and interpretation with DL resulted in overall net reclassification improvement of 17.2% (95% CI 9.2%-24.4%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Explainable DL predictions lead to meaningful improvements in physician interpretation; however, the improvement varied across the readers, reflecting the acceptance of this new technology. This technique could be implemented as an aid to physician diagnosis, improving the diagnostic accuracy of MPI.", "Keywords": ["artificial intelligence", "deep learning", "implementation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Myocardial Perfusion Imaging", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Deep Learning", "Artificial Intelligence", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Physicians"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J H", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Keiichiro", "Last Name": "Kuronuma", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Ananya", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Yuka", "Last Name": "Otaki", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Hayes", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Panithaya", "Last Name": "Chareonthaitawee", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Kavanagh", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Tejas", "Last Name": "Parekh", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Balaji K", "Last Name": "Tamarappoo", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imaging, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Tali", "Last Name": "Sharir", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Cardiology, Assuta Medical Centers, Tel Aviv, Israel and Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheba, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mathews B", "Last Name": "Fish", "Affiliation": "Oregon Heart and Vascular Institute, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Springfield, Oregon."}, {"First Name": "Terrence D", "Last Name": "Ruddy", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Philipp A", "Last Name": "Kaufmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cardiac Imaging, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Albert J", "Last Name": "Sinusas", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Edward J", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Timothy M", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Imaging Technologies LLC, Kansas City, Missouri;

Purpose To create a framework to assess radiation doses within broad CT categories defined according to body region and clinical imaging indication and to cluster indications according to the dose required for sufficient image quality. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine metadata. CT examinations in adults from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 from the University of California San Francisco International CT Dose Registry were grouped into 19 categories according to body region and required radiation dose levels. Five body regions had a single dose range (ie, extremities, neck, thoracolumbar spine, combined chest and abdomen, and combined thoracolumbar spine). Five additional regions were subdivided according to dose. Head, chest, cardiac, and abdomen each had low, routine, and high dose categories; combined head and neck had routine and high dose categories. For each category, the median and 75th percentile (ie, diagnostic reference level [DRL]) were determined for dose-length product, and the variation in dose within categories versus across categories was calculated and compared using an analysis of variance. Relative median and DRL (95% CI) doses comparing high dose versus low dose categories were calculated. Results Among 4.5 million examinations, the median and DRL doses varied approximately 10 times between categories compared with between indications within categories. For head, chest, abdomen, and cardiac (3\u2009266\u2009546 examinations [72%]), the relative median doses were higher in examinations assigned to the high dose categories than in examinations assigned to the low dose categories, suggesting the assignment of indications to the broad categories is valid (head, 3.4-fold higher [95% CI: 3.4, 3.5]; chest, 9.6 [95% CI: 9.3, 10.0]; abdomen, 2.4 [95% CI: 2.4, 2.5]; and cardiac, 18.1 [95% CI: 17.7, 18.6]). Results were similar for DRL doses (all P < .001). Conclusion Broad categories based on image quality requirements are a suitable framework for simplifying radiation dose assessment, according to expected variation between and within categories. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Mahesh in this issue.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Metadata", "Middle Aged", "Radiation Dosage", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Smith-Bindman", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging (R.S.B., S.Y., Y.W., M.D.K., P.C., R.C., J.L., C.S.), Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (R.S.B., A.B.), Philip R.

While the machine learning community has generally accepted methods such as k-fold stratified cross-validation (CV) to be more rigorous than single split validation, the standard research practice in medical fields is the use of single split validation techniques. This is especially concerning given the relatively small sample sizes of datasets used for cardiovascular imaging. We aim to examine how train-test split variation impacts the stability of machine learning (ML) model performance estimates in several validation techniques on two real-world cardiovascular imaging datasets: stratified split-sample validation (70/30 and 50/50 train-test splits), tenfold stratified CV, 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009repeated tenfold stratified CV, bootstrapping (500\u2009\u00d7\u2009repeated), and leave one out (LOO) validation. We demonstrate that split validation methods lead to the highest range in AUC and statistically significant differences in ROC curves, unlike the other aforementioned approaches. When building predictive models on relatively small data sets as is often the case in medical imaging, split-sample validation techniques can produce instability in performance estimates with variations in range over 0.15 in the AUC values, and thus any of the alternate validation methods are recommended.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Area Under Curve", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Machine Learning", "Myocardial Perfusion Imaging", "Reproducibility of Results"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vikash", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Pencina", "Affiliation": "Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joanna X", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Departments of Medicine and Cardiology, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Beverly Boulevard, Ste.

Although both measures can be quantified with any stress imaging modality, they are not routinely evaluated during clinical interpretation. We assessed their independent associations with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including measures of poststress change in shape index and eccentricity index. Methods: Patients undergoing SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging between 2009 and 2014 from the Registry of Fast Myocardial Perfusion Imaging with Next-Generation SPECT (REFINE SPECT) were studied. Shape index (ratio between the maximum left ventricular diameter in short axis and ventricular length) and eccentricity index (calculated from orthogonal diameters in short axis and length) were calculated in end-diastole at stress and rest. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess independent associations with MACE (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or late revascularization). Results: In total, 14,016 patients with a mean age of 64.3 \u00b1 12.2 y (8,469 [60.4%] male were included. MACE occurred in 2,120 patients during a median follow-up of 4.3 y (interquartile range, 3.4-5.7). Rest, stress, and poststress change in shape and eccentricity indices were associated with MACE in unadjusted analyses (all P < 0.001). However, in multivariable models, only poststress change in shape index (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.38; P < 0.001) and eccentricity index (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; P = 0.033) remained associated with MACE. Conclusion: Two novel measures, poststress change in shape index and eccentricity index, were independently associated with MACE and improved risk estimation.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology allows for the creation of physical cardiac models that can be used for teaching trainees. 3D printed cardiac models were created for the following lesions: pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, d-transposition of the great arteries, coarctation of the aorta, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Medical students participated in a workshop consisting of different teaching stations. At the 3D printed station, students completed a pre- and post-intervention survey assessing their knowledge of each cardiac lesion on a Likert scale. Students were asked to rank the educational benefit of each modality. Linear regression was utilized to assess the correlation of the mean increase in knowledge with increasing complexity of CHD based on the Aristotle Basic Complexity Level. 45 medical students attended the CHD workshop. Students' knowledge significantly improved for every lesion (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A strong positive correlation was found between mean increase in knowledge and increasing complexity of CHD (R2\u2009=\u20090.73, p\u2009<\u20090.05). The 3D printed models, pathology specimens and spoken explanation were found to be the most helpful modalities. Students \"strongly agreed\" the 3D printed models made them more confident in explaining congenital cardiac anatomy to others (mean\u2009=\u20094.23,\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69), and that they recommend the use of 3D models for future educational sessions (mean\u2009=\u20094.40,\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69). 3D printed cardiac models should be included in medical student education particularly for lesions that require a complex understanding of spatial relationships.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Education, Medical", "Female", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Anatomic", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Self Report", "Students, Medical", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Smerling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "Marboe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay H", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Pavlicova", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshifumi", "Last Name": "Naka", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Glickstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 3959 Broadway, CHN-2, New York, NY, 10023, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kanwal M", "Last Name": "Farooqi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 3959 Broadway, CHN-2, New York, NY, 10023, USA. kf2549@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31202740", "Title": "5-Year Prognostic Value of Quantitative\u00a0Versus Visual MPI in Subtle\u00a0Perfusion\u00a0Defects: Results From REFINE SPECT.", "Abstract": "This study compared the ability of automated myocardial perfusion imaging analysis to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) to that of visual analysis.", "Keywords": ["major adverse cardiac event", "myocardial perfusion imaging", "prognosis", "quantification"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Coronary Circulation", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Perfusion Imaging", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuka", "Last Name": "Otaki", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Departments of Imaging, Medicine, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Betancur", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Departments of Imaging, Medicine, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Tali", "Last Name": "Sharir", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Cardiology, Assuta Medical Centers, Tel Aviv, and Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheba, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Lien-Hsin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Departments of Imaging, Medicine, and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California;

We evaluated the prediction of obstructive disease from combined analysis of semiupright and supine stress MPI by deep learning (DL) as compared with standard combined total perfusion deficit (TPD). Methods: 1,160 patients without known coronary artery disease (64% male) were studied. Patients underwent stress 99mTc-sestamibi MPI with new-generation solid-state SPECT scanners in 4 different centers. All patients had on-site clinical reads and invasive coronary angiography correlations within 6 mo of MPI. Obstructive disease was defined as at least 70% narrowing of the 3 major coronary arteries and at least 50% for the left main coronary artery. Images were quantified at Cedars-Sinai. The left ventricular myocardium was segmented using standard clinical nuclear cardiology software. The contour placement was verified by an experienced technologist. Combined stress TPD was computed using sex- and camera-specific normal limits. DL was trained using polar distributions of normalized radiotracer counts, hypoperfusion defects, and hypoperfusion severities and was evaluated for prediction of obstructive disease in a novel leave-one-center-out cross-validation procedure equivalent to external validation. During the validation procedure, 4 DL models were trained using data from 3 centers and then evaluated on the 1 center left aside. Predictions for each center were merged to have an overall estimation of the multicenter performance. Results: 718 (62%) patients and 1,272 of 3,480 (37%) arteries had obstructive disease. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for prediction of disease on a per-patient and per-vessel basis by DL was higher than for combined TPD (per-patient, 0.81 vs. 0.78; per-vessel, 0.77 vs. 0.73; P < 0.001). With the DL cutoff set to exhibit the same specificity as the standard cutoff for combined TPD, per-patient sensitivity improved from 61.8% (TPD) to 65.6% (DL) (P < 0.05), and per-vessel sensitivity improved from 54.6% (TPD) to 59.1% (DL) (P < 0.01). With the threshold matched to the specificity of a normal clinical read (56.3%), DL had a sensitivity of 84.8%, versus 82.6% for an on-site clinical read (P = 0.3). Conclusion: DL improves automatic interpretation of MPI as compared with current quantitative methods.", "Keywords": ["SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging", "convolutional neural network", "deep learning", "obstructive coronary artery disease", "total perfusion deficit"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Deep Learning", "Female", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Perfusion Imaging", "Stress, Physiological", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Betancur", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Imaging, and Departments of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Lien-Hsin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Imaging, and Departments of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Frederic", "Last Name": "Commandeur", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Imaging, and Departments of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Tali", "Last Name": "Sharir", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Cardiology, Assuta Medical Centers, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mathews B", "Last Name": "Fish", "Affiliation": "Oregon Heart and Vascular Institute, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Springfield, Oregon."}, {"First Name": "Terrence D", "Last Name": "Ruddy", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Philipp A", "Last Name": "Kaufmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cardiac Imaging, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Albert J", "Last Name": "Sinusas", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Edward J", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Timothy M", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Imaging Technologies LLC, Kansas City, Missouri;

We put forth discussions on the need for disruptive innovation in imaging-guided care that places the imager as a central force in care coordination. Value-based nuclear cardiology is defined as care that is both efficient and effective. Novel testing strategies that defer testing in lower risk patients are examples of the kind of innovation needed in today's healthcare environment. A major focus of current research is the evolution of the importance of ischemia and the prognostic significance of non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaque and coronary microvascular dysfunction. Embracing novel paradigms, such as this, can aid in the development of optimal strategies for coronary disease management.

The wider usage of technetium-99m (Tc-99m)-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using gamma cameras has contributed to better quality studies and lower radiation exposure to patients. Increased availability of tracers and scanners for positron emission tomography (PET) will help further improve the quality of studies and quantify myocardial blood flow and myocardial flow reserve, thus enhancing the contribution of non-invasive imaging to the management of coronary artery disease. The introduction of new instrumentation such as solid state cameras and new software will help reduce further radiation exposure to patients undergoing nuclear cardiology studies. Results from recent studies, focused on assessing the relationship between best practices and radiation risk, provide useful insights on simple measures to improve the safety of nuclear cardiology studies without compromising the quality of results.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiac Imaging Techniques", "Cardiology", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Nuclear Medicine", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Technetium", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maurizio", "Last Name": "Dondi", "Affiliation": "Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging Section, Division of Human Health, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria. mauriziodondi@yahoo.it."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Pascual", "Affiliation": "Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging Section, Division of Human Health, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Diana", "Last Name": "Paez", "Affiliation": "Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging Section, Division of Human Health, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "28382541", "Title": "The Private Practice Corner: A new column in the Journal of Nuclear Cardiology.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiology", "Periodicals as Topic", "Private Practice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, and Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, 622 West 168th Street PH 10-203A, New York, NY, 10032, USA. andrew.einstein@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Randall C", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "28095022", "Title": "Estimating Effective Dose of Radiation From Pediatric Cardiac CT Angiography Using a 64-MDCT Scanner: New Conversion Factors Relating Dose-Length Product to Effective Dose.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine the conversion factors that enable accurate estimation of the effective dose (ED) used for cardiac 64-MDCT angiography performed for children.", "Keywords": ["conversion factor", "dose-length product", "effective dose", "pediatric cardiac CT", "radiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Child", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Multidetector Computed Tomography", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Radiation Exposure", "Radiation Monitoring", "Relative Biological Effectiveness", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sigal", "Last Name": "Trattner", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Chelliah", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Cardiology Division, New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Prinsen", "Affiliation": "3 Philips Healthcare Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Carrie B", "Last Name": "Ruzal-Shapiro", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yanping", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "5 Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, Irvington, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Jambawalikar", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Maxwell", "Last Name": "Amurao", "Affiliation": "6 Radiation Safety Office, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "7 Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division and Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, 622 W 168th St, PH 10-203A, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "AJR.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves left ventricular (LV) size and function in patients with markedly abnormal electrocardiogram QRS duration. However, relation of baseline RV function with response to CRT has not been well described. In this study, we aim to investigate the relation of baseline RV function with response to CRT as assessed by change in LV ejection fraction (EF). A systematic search of studies published from 1966 to May 31, 2015 was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and the Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they have reported (1) parameters of baseline RV function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] or RVEF or RV basal strain or RV fractional area change [FAC]) and (2) LVEF before and after CRT. Random-effects metaregression was used to evaluate the effect of baseline RV function parameters and change in LVEF. Sixteen studies (n\u00a0= 1,764) were selected for final analysis. Random-effects metaregression analysis showed no significant association between the magnitude of the difference in EF before and after CRT with baseline TAPSE (\u03b2 = 0.005, p = 0.989); baseline RVEF (\u03b2 = 0.270, p = 0.493); baseline RVFAC (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.367, p = 0.06); baseline basal strain (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.342, p\u00a0= 0.462) after a mean follow-up period of 10.5\u00a0months. In conclusion, baseline RV function as assessed by TAPSE, FAC, basal strain, or RVEF does not determine response to CRT as assessed by change in LVEF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Right", "Ventricular Function, Right"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, New York, New York.

Funding agencies and research review panels request a power analysis, for example, to determine the minimum number of subjects needed for an experiment to be informative. Calculating the right sample size is crucial to gaining accurate information and ensures that research resources are used efficiently and ethically. The simple question \"How many subjects do I need?\" does not always have a simple answer. Before calculating the sample size requirements, a researcher must address several aspects, such as purpose of the research (descriptive or comparative), type of samples (one or more groups), and data being collected (continuous or categorical). In this article, we describe some of the most frequent methods for calculating the sample size with examples from nuclear cardiology research, including for t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), non-parametric tests, correlation, Chi-squared tests, and survival analysis. For the ease of implementation, several examples are also illustrated via user-friendly free statistical software.", "Keywords": ["Sample size", "clinical research", "nuclear cardiology"], "MeSH

CT scanners differ in their capabilities, and various indications require unique protocols, but there remains room for standardization and optimization. In this paper, the authors summarize approaches to reduce dose, as discussed in lectures constituting the first session of the 2013 UCSF Virtual Symposium on Radiation Safety and Computed Tomography. The experience of scanning at low dose in different body regions, for both diagnostic and interventional CT procedures, is addressed. An essential primary step is justifying the medical need for each scan. General guiding principles for reducing dose include tailoring a scan to a patient, minimizing scan length, use of tube current modulation and minimizing tube current, minimizing tube potential, iterative reconstruction, and periodic review of CT studies. Organized efforts for standardization have been spearheaded by professional societies such as the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Finally, all team members should demonstrate an awareness of the importance of minimizing dose.", "Keywords": ["CT", "justification", "optimization", "radiation dose"], "MeSH terms": ["Health Physics", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiation Protection", "Radiographic Image Enhancement", "Radiology", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sigal", "Last Name": "Trattner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Gregory D N", "Last Name": "Pearson", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering, University of California, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Dianna D", "Last Name": "Cody", "Affiliation": "Department of Imaging Physics, Division of Diagnostic Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "Rajiv", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher P", "Last Name": "Hess", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering, University of California, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Mannudeep K", "Last Name": "Kalra", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Kofler", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN."}, {"First Name": "Mayil S", "Last Name": "Krishnam", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of California Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24530677", "Title": "Patient-centered imaging: shared decision making for cardiac imaging procedures with exposure to ionizing radiation.", "Abstract": "The current paper details the recommendations arising from an NIH-NHLBI/NCI-sponsored symposium held in November 2012, aiming to identify key components of a radiation accountability framework fostering patient-centered imaging and shared decision-making in cardiac imaging. Symposium participants, working in 3 tracks, identified key components of a framework to target critical radiation safety issues for the patient, the laboratory, and the larger population of patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. The use of ionizing radiation during an imaging procedure should be disclosed to all patients by the ordering provider at the time of ordering, and reinforced by the performing provider team. An imaging protocol with effective dose \u22643 mSv is considered very low risk, not warranting extensive discussion or written informed consent. However, a protocol effective dose >20 mSv was proposed as a level requiring particular attention in terms of shared decision-making and either formal discussion or written informed consent. Laboratory reporting of radiation dosimetry is a critical component of creating a quality laboratory fostering a patient-centered environment with transparent procedural methodology. Efforts should be directed to avoiding testing involving radiation, in patients with inappropriate indications. Standardized reporting and diagnostic reference levels for computed tomography and nuclear cardiology are important for the goal of public reporting of laboratory radiation dose levels in conjunction with diagnostic performance. The development of cardiac imaging technologies revolutionized cardiology practice by allowing routine, noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion and anatomy. It is now incumbent upon the imaging community to create an accountability framework to safely drive appropriate imaging utilization.", "Keywords": ["appropriate use", "image quality", "imaging", "radiation safety"], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Decision Making", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Humans", "Patient-Centered Care", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiation Injuries", "Radiation, Ionizing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.

We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases for studies published between 1966 to January 2013 that compared left ventricle (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass measured by MDCT and CMR. We performed meta-analyses and used random-effects model with inverse variance weighting test to determine the overall bias and limits of agreement of LV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and EF measured by MDCT and CMR. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to compare 16-slice and 64-slice MDCT with CMR. Two study authors independently reviewed the 90 articles originally identified and selected 27 studies (n = 831) for analysis. Excellent correlation and a linear relation were seen between MDCT and CMR for LV end-diastolic volume (r = 0.93; p <0.001), LV end-systolic volume (r = 0.95; p <0.001), LV stroke volume (r = 0.85; p <0.001), LV ejection fraction (r = 0.93; p <0.001), and LV mass (r = 0.86; p <0.001). Subgroup analyses showed strong positive correlations for both 16- and 64-slice MDCT. In conclusion, although not the first-line test for LV function assessment in most patients, when appropriate, retrospectively gated MDCT provides an accurate and valid assessment of LV function compared with CMR.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multidetector Computed Tomography", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York.
