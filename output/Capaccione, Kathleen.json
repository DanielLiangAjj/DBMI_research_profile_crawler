It functions through canonical SMAD-mediated processes and noncanonical pathways involving MAPK cascades, PI3K/AKT, Rho-like GTPases, and NF-\u03baB signaling. This intricate signaling system is finely tuned by interactions between canonical and noncanonical pathways and plays key roles in both physiologic and pathologic conditions including tissue homeostasis, fibrosis, and cancer progression. TGF-\u03b2 signaling is known to have paradoxical actions. Under normal physiologic conditions, TGF-\u03b2 signaling promotes cell quiescence and apoptosis, acting as a tumor suppressor. In contrast, in pathological states such as inflammation and cancer, it triggers processes that facilitate cancer progression and tissue remodeling, thus promoting tumor development and fibrosis. Here, we detail the role that TGF-\u03b2 plays in cancer and fibrosis and highlight the potential for future theranostics targeting this pathway.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell signaling", "Fibrosis", "Precision medicine", "TGF-\u03b2", "Theranostics"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Neoplasms", "Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Signal Transduction", "Fibrosis", "Animals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna O", "Last Name": "Giarratana", "Affiliation": "Northwell Health - Peconic Bay Medical Center, 1 Heroes Way, Riverhead, NY, 11901, USA. agiarratana@northwell.edu."}, {"First Name": "Conor M", "Last Name": "Prendergast", "Affiliation": "New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, 10595, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary M", "Last Name": "Salvatore", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 11032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen M", "Last Name": "Capaccione", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 11032, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "PubDate": "2024Jun26"}, {"PMID": "38872212", "Title": "Imaging at the nexus: how state of the art imaging techniques can enhance our understanding of cancer and fibrosis.", "Abstract": "Both cancer and fibrosis are diseases involving dysregulation of cell signaling pathways resulting in an altered cellular microenvironment which ultimately leads to progression of the condition.

A new diagnostic imaging tool in PET/computed tomography (CT) is the use of radiolabeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI). SGHI uses high-frequency sound waves to penetrate deeper into the tissue, providing a more detailed view of the tumor microenvironment.

its first approval by the FDA in 2017, tremendous progress has been made in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, the adoptive transfer of engineered, CAR-expressing T lymphocyte. CAR T cells are all composed of three main elements: an extracellular antigen-binding domain, an intracellular signaling domain responsible for T cell activation, and a hinge that joins these two domains. Continuous improvement has been made in CARs, now in their fifth generation, particularly in the intracellular signaling domain responsible for T cell activation. CAR T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Nonetheless, the use of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors has not attained comparable levels of success. Here we review the challenges in achieving effective CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors, and emerging CAR T cells that have shown great promise for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A growing number of clinical trials have been conducted to study the effect of CAR T cell therapy on NSCLC, targeting different types of surface antigens. They include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mesothelin (MSLN), prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and mucin 1 (MUC1). Potential new targets such as erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma A2 (EphA2), tissue factor (TF), and protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) are currently under investigation in clinical trials. The challenges in developing CAR T for NSCLC therapy and other approaches for enhancing CAR T efficacy are discussed. Finally, we provide our perspective on imaging CAR T cell action by reviewing the two main radionuclide-based CAR T cell imaging techniques, the direct labeling of CAR T cells or indirect labeling via a reporter gene.", "Keywords": ["CAR T cell therapy", "NSCLC", "imaging", "non-small cell lung cancer", "solid tumors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong Yun", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeeban", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Conor", "Last Name": "Prendergast", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dorine", "Last Name": "De Jong", "Affiliation": "RefleXion Medical Inc., Hayward, CA 94545, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Braumuller", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacienta", "Last Name": "Paily", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophia", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Connie", "Last Name": "Liou", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Giarratana", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahdie", "Last Name": "Hosseini", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen M", "Last Name": "Capaccione", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medica Center, 622 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Current issues in molecular biology", "PubDate": "2023Nov12"}, {"PMID": "37717512", "Title": "Establishing quantitative radiographic criteria for the diagnosis of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis.", "Abstract": "Pleuroparenchymal Fibroelastosis (PPFE) is a type of pulmonary fibrosis most commonly occurring at the apices.

The development of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has arguably been the biggest advance in lung cancer treatment, given that the vast majority of NSCLC tumors can be treated with these therapies. Specific targeted therapies, including those against KRAS, EGFR, RTK, and others have also improved the outcomes for those individuals bearing an actionable mutation. New and emerging therapies, such as bispecific antibodies, CAR T cell therapy, and molecular targeted radiotherapy, offer promise to patients for whom none of the existing therapies have proved effective.

Lung cancer in patients with IPF differs from cancers that develop in the non-fibrotic lung. Peripherally located adenocarcinoma is the most frequent cell type in smokers who develop lung cancer, while squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent in pulmonary fibrosis. Increased fibroblast foci in IPF are associated with more aggressive cancer behaviour and shorter doubling times. Treatment of lung cancer in fibrosis is challenging because of the risk of inducing an exacerbation of fibrosis. In order to improve patient outcomes, modifications of current lung cancer screening guidelines in patients with pulmonary fibrosis will be necessary to avoid delays in treatment. 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) imaging can help identify cancer earlier and more reliably than CT alone.

Methods: Four hundred and fifty-three consecutive women with chest CT scans (contrast and non-contrast) preceding mammograms within one year comprise the study population. All chest CT images were reviewed by an experienced fellowship-trained chest radiologist and mammograms by an experienced fellowship-trained mammographer without the benefit of prior or ancillary studies; only four mammographic views were included for analysis. The size, location, and shape of breast masses were documented; on CT, the average Hounsfield units were measured. On both imaging modalities, the presence of lymphadenopathy, architectural distortion, skin thickening, and microcalcifications were recorded. Ultimately, the interpreting radiologist was asked to decide if a biopsy was indicated, and these recommendations were correlated with the patient\u2019s outcome. Findings: Nineteen of four hundred and fifty-three patients had breast cancer at the time of the mammography. Breast masses were the most common finding on chest CT, leading to the recommendation for biopsy. Hounsfield units were the most important feature for discerning benign from malignant masses. CT sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT for breast cancer detection was 84.21%, 99.3%, and 98.68% compared to 78.95%, 93.78%, and 93.16% for four-view mammography. Chest CT scans with or without contrast had similar outcomes for specificity and accuracy, but sensitivity was slightly less without contrast. Chest CT alone, without the benefit of prior exams and patient recall, correctly diagnosed cancer with a p-value of <0.0001 compared to mammography with the same limitations.

FAP-targeted molecular radiotherapy has shown efficacy in both preclinical and clinical models and has immunomodulatory effects. Here, we studied if combined immunotherapy and radiotherapy could increase antitumor efficacy in murine models of lung cancer and melanoma and interrogated the mechanisms by which these treatments attenuate tumor growth. Using LLC1 and B16F10 murine models of lung cancer and melanoma, respectively, we tested the efficacy of 177Lu-FAPI-04 alone and in combination with immunotherapy. Alone, 177Lu-FAPI-04 significantly reduced tumor growth in both models. In animals with melanoma, combined therapy resulted in tumor regression while lung tumor growth was attenuated, but tumors did not regress. Combined therapy significantly increased caspase-3 and decreased Ki67 compared with immunotherapy alone. Flow cytometry demonstrated that tumor-associated macrophages responded in a tumor-dependent manner which was distinct in animals treated with both therapies compared with either therapy alone. These data demonstrate that 177Lu-FAPI-04 is an effective anticancer therapy for melanoma and lung cancer which mediates effects at least partially through induction of apoptosis and modulation of the immune response.

Granzyme B PET imaging demonstrated increased uptake in the region of LPS injection after 24 h, which normalized at 120 h. Granzyme B immunofluorescence showed specific staining in tissue from the 24 h time point compared to the PBS-injected control.

The pathophysiology of IPF is complex as there are likely different stages of disease occurring simultaneously in the lung. Areas covered: Some scientists consider IPF as primarily an epithelial driven disease in which dysfunctional surfactant-producing cells take an etiological precedent. Others focus on the augmented deposition of collagen within the interstitium as the primary inciting event causing fibrosis. An increase in collagen deposition augmenting the tensile strength of the pulmonary interstitium fits with the well-known restrictive nature of fibrotic lung diseases; however, it fails to explain the creation of cystic 'honeycombing' lesions and the preference of such lesions for the peripheral and basilar lung parenchyma.

We demonstrate a functional role for Sox9 in inducing a mesenchymal phenotype in lung ADC. We show that Sox9 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in lung ADC, particularly those with KRAS mutations. Sox9 expression correlated with the Notch target gene Hes1, and numerous other Notch pathway components. We observed that Sox9 is a potent inducer of lung cancer cell motility and invasion, and a negative regulator of E-cadherin, a key protein that is lost during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, we show that Notch1 signaling directly regulates Sox9 expression through a SOX9 promoter binding site, independently of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and that Sox9 participates in Notch-1 induced cell motility, cell invasion, and loss of E-cadherin expression. Together, the results identify a new functional role for a Notch1-Sox9 signaling axis in lung ADC that may explain the correlation of Sox9 with tumor progression, higher tumor grade, and poor lung cancer survival. In addition to Notch and TGF-\u03b2, Sox9 also acts downstream of NF-\u03baB, BMP, EGFR, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.

At the molecular level, ligand binding activates Notch signaling by liberating the Notch intracellular domain, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates gene transcription. Despite the elegant simplicity of this pathway, which lacks secondary messengers or a signaling cascade, Notch regulates gene expression in a highly context- and cell-type-dependent manner. Notch signaling is frequently dysregulated, most commonly by overactivation, across many cancers and confers a survival advantage on tumors, leading to poorer outcomes for patients. Recent studies demonstrate how Notch signaling increases tumor cell proliferation and provide evidence that active Notch signaling maintains the cancer stem-cell pool, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes chemoresistance. These studies imply that pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling may refine control of cancer therapy and improve patient survival. Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are drugs that inhibit Notch signaling and may be successful in controlling cancer cell growth in conjunction with standard chemotherapy, but substantial side effects have hampered their widespread use. Recent efforts have been aimed at the development of antibodies against specific Notch receptors and ligands with the hope of limiting side effects while providing the same therapeutic benefit as GSIs.
