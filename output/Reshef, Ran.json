[{"PMID": "38776397", "Title": "Absolute Lymphocyte Count after BCMA CAR-T Therapy is a Predictor of Response and Outcomes in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma.", "Abstract": "BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells used in multiple myeloma (MM) are rapidly becoming a mainstay in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (RR) disease, and CAR-T cell expansion post-infusion has been shown to inform depth and duration of response, but measuring this process remains investigational. This multicenter study describes the kinetics and prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in the first 15 days after CAR-T infusion in 156 relapsed MM patients treated with the BCMA-targeting agents cilta-cel and ide-cel. Patients with higher maximum ALC (ALCmax) had better depth of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DoR). Patients with ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL had a superior PFS (30.5 versus 6 months, p <0.001) compared to those \u22641.0x103/uL, while patients with ALCmax \u22640.5 x103/uL represent a high-risk group with early disease progression and short PFS (HR 3.4, 95 CI: 2 -5.8, P <0.001). In multivariate analysis, ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL and non-paraskeletal extramedullary disease were the only independent predictors of PFS and DoR after accounting for ISS staging, age, CAR-T product, high-risk cytogenetics and number of previous lines. Moreover, our flow cytometry data suggests that ALC is a surrogate for BCMA CAR-T expansion and can be used as an accessible prognostic marker. We report for the first time the association of ALC after BCMA CAR-T infusion with clinical outcomes and its utility in predicting response in RRMM patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mateo", "Last Name": "Mejia Saldarriaga", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Darren", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Unkenholz", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tarek H", "Last Name": "Mouhieddine", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juan Esteban", "Last Name": "Velez-Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Engles", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua Alexander", "Last Name": "Fein", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Monge", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cara A", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Pearse", "Affiliation": "Cornell University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Jayabalan", "Affiliation": "Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Christian A", "Last Name": "Gordillo", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hei Ton", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Yamshon", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Santiago", "Last Name": "Thibaud", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Giorgio Ga", "Last Name": "Inghirami", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Lentzsch", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adriana", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samir", "Last Name": "Parekh", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NEW YORK, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sundar", "Last Name": "Jagannath", "Affiliation": "Mt.

We analyzed clinical data and serum samples at the initiation of second-line systemic treatment of acute GVHD from 167 patients from 17 centers of the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) between 2016 and 2021. Sixty-two patients received ruxolitinib-based therapy, whereas 102 received other systemic agents. In agreement with prospective trials, ruxolitinib resulted in a higher day 28 (D28) overall response Frate than nonruxolitinib therapies (55% vs 31%, P\u00a0= .003) and patients who received ruxolitinib had significantly lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) than those who received nonruxolitinib therapies (point estimates at 2-year: 35% vs 61%, P\u00a0= .002). Biomarker analyses demonstrated that the benefit from ruxolitinib was observed only in patients with low MAGIC algorithm probabilities (MAPs) at the start of second-line treatment. Among patients with a low MAP, those who received ruxolitinib experienced significantly lower NRM than those who received nonruxolitinib therapies (point estimates at 2-year: 12% vs 41%, P\u00a0= .016). However, patients with high MAP experienced high NRM regardless of treatment with ruxolitinib or nonruxolitinib therapies (point estimates at 2-year: 67% vs 80%, P\u00a0= .65). A landmark analysis demonstrated that the relationship between the D28 response and NRM largely depends on the MAP level at the initiation of second-line therapy.

At CR/VGPR, elevated MAGIC biomarkers predicted the future occurrence of a flare, along with its severity and LGI involvement. In multivariate analyses, higher Ann Arbor (AA) biomarker scores at CR/VGPR were significant risk factors for flares (AA2 vs AA1: aHR, 1.81 [95%\u00a0CI, 1.32-2.48; P\u00a0= .001]; AA3 vs AA1: aHR, 3.14 [95%\u00a0CI, 1.98-4.98; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001]), as were early response to initial treatment (aHR, 1.84; 95%\u00a0CI, 1.21-2.80; P\u00a0= .004) and HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (aHR, 1.74; 95%\u00a0CI, 1.00-3.02; P\u00a0= .049). MAGIC biomarkers also stratified the risk of NRM both at CR/VGPR and at the time of flare. We conclude that GVHD flares are common and carry a significant mortality risk. The occurrence of future flares can be predicted by serum biomarkers that may serve to guide adjustment and discontinuation of immunosuppression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Graft vs Host

been adopted as the primary endpoint for clinical trials of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). However, physicians often need to modify immunosuppression earlier than day (D) 28, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) does not always correlate with ORR at D28. We studied 1144 patients that received systemic treatment for GVHD in the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) and divided them into a training set (n=764) and a validation set (n=380). We used a recursive partitioning algorithm to create a Mount Sinai model that classifies patients into favorable or unfavorable groups that predicted 12 month NRM according to overall GVHD grade at both onset and D14. In the Mount Sinai model grade II GVHD at D14 was unfavorable for grade III/IV GVHD at onset and predicted NRM as well as the D28 standard response model. The MAGIC algorithm probability (MAP) is a validated score that combines the serum concentrations of suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) and regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (REG3\u03b1) to predict NRM. Inclusion of the D14 MAP biomarker score with the D14 Mount Sinai model created three distinct groups (good, intermediate, poor) with strikingly different NRM (8%, 35%, 76% respectively). This D14 MAGIC model displayed better AUC, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive value, and net benefit in decision curve analysis compared to the D28 standard response model. We conclude that this D14 MAGIC model could be useful in therapeutic decisions and may offer an improved endpoint for clinical trials of acute GVHD treatment.", "Keywords": ["Acute GVHD",

An individual with mild developmental delay, macrothrombocytopenia, and susceptibility to infections, molluscum contagiosum virus, and EBV-associated lymphoma had functional NKD for over a decade. A de novo ACTB variant encoding G342D \u03b2-actin was identified and was consistent with the individual's developmental and platelet phenotype. This novel variant also was found to have direct impact in NK cells because its expression in the human NK cell line YTS (YTS-NKD) caused increased cell spreading in lytic immune synapses created on activating surfaces. YTS-NKD cells were able to degranulate and perform cytotoxicity, but they demonstrated defective serial killing because of prolonged conjugation to the killed target cell and thus were effectively unable to terminate lytic synapses.

We utilized samples from 203 allo-HCT patients selected from the Blood & Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) to identify new biomarker models to predict aGvHD and overall mortality. Two new biomarkers (Gal-3 and LAG-3), and previously identified biomarkers (ST2/IL33R, IL6, Reg3A, PD-1, TIM-3, TNFR1) were screened. Increased Gal-3 levels measured at Day +7 post-transplant predicted the development of aGvHD (grade 2-4) in the total population [AUC: 0.602; P\u2009=\u20090.045] while higher Day +14 levels predicted overall mortality due to toxicity among patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning [P\u2009=\u20090.028] but not myeloablative conditioning. Elevated LAG-3 levels (Day +21) were associated with less severe aGvHD [159.1\u2009ng/mL vs 222.0\u2009ng/mL; P\u2009=\u20090.046]. We developed a model utilizing Gal-3, LAG-3, and PD-1 levels at Days +14 and +21 with an improved performance to predict aGvHD and overall non-relapse mortality. We confirmed four informative biomarkers (Reg3A, ST2, TIM-3, and TNFR1) predict severe aGvHD at day +14 and day +21 (grade 3-4).

anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). Approval was supported by the phase 2, multicenter, single-arm ZUMA-5 study of axi-cel for patients with R/R indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL; N\u00a0= 104), including FL and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). In the primary analysis (median follow-up, 17.5 months), the overall response rate (ORR) was 92% (complete response rate, 74%). Here, we report long-term outcomes from ZUMA-5. Eligible patients with R/R iNHL after \u22652 lines of therapy underwent leukapheresis, followed by lymphodepleting chemotherapy and axi-cel infusion (2\u00a0\u00d7 106 CAR T cells per kg). The primary end point was ORR, assessed in this analysis by investigators in all enrolled patients (intent-to-treat). After median follow-up of 41.7 months in FL (n\u00a0= 127) and 31.8 months in MZL (n = 31), ORR was comparable with that of the primary analysis (FL, 94%; MZL, 77%). Median progression-free survival was 40.2 months in FL and not reached in MZL. Medians of overall survival were not reached in either disease type. Grade \u22653 adverse events of interest that occurred after the prior analyses were largely in recently treated patients. Clinical and pharmacokinetic outcomes correlated negatively with recent exposure to bendamustine and high metabolic tumor volume. After 3 years of follow-up in ZUMA-5, axi-cel demonstrated continued durable responses, with very few relapses beyond 2 years, and manageable safety in patients with R/R iNHL.

We demonstrate here that Id3, a DNA-binding inhibitor, is critical for sustaining T-cell responses in GVHD target tissues in mice, including the liver and intestine. Id3 loss results in aberrantly expressed PD-1 in polyfunctional T helper 1 (Th1) cells, decreased tissue-infiltrating PD-1+ polyfunctional Th1 cell numbers, impaired maintenance of liver TCF-1+ progenitor-like T cells, and inhibition of GVHD. PD-1 blockade restores the capacity of Id3-ablated donor T cells to mediate GVHD. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that Id3 loss leads to significantly decreased CD28- and PI3K/AKT-signaling activity in tissue-infiltrating polyfunctional Th1 cells, an indicator of active PD-1/PD-L1 effects. Id3 is also required for protecting CD8+ T cells from the PD-1 pathway-mediated suppression during GVHD. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that Id3 represses transcription factors (e.g., Nfatc2, Fos, Jun, Ets1, and Prdm1) that are critical for PD-1 transcription, exuberant effector differentiation, and interferon responses and dysfunction of activated T cells. Id3 achieves these effects by restraining the chromatin accessibility for these transcription factors. Id3 ablation in donor T cells preserved their graft vs tumor effects in mice undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ID3 in human CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells retained their antitumor activity in NOD/SCID/IL2Rg-/- mice early after administration. These findings identify that ID3 is an important target to reduce GVHD, and the gene-editing program of ID3 may have broad implications in T-cell-based immunotherapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Humans", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Mice, SCID", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Transcription Factors", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute and Department of Cancer Cellular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Gennaro", "Last Name": "Calendo", "Affiliation": "Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Tien", "Last Name": "Bui", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Che Young", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Ciril", "Last Name": "Abraham", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Wenbin", "Last Name": "Mo", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Ruqayyah", "Last Name": "Sanders-Braggs", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Jozef", "Last Name": "Madzo", "Affiliation": "Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Pierre", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth O", "Last Name": "Hexner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Wiest", "Affiliation": "Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Hai-Hui", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2024Jan11"}, {"PMID": "37527011", "Title": "Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Combination with the 4-1BB Agonist Utomilumab in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Phase 1 Results from ZUMA-11.", "Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown clinical benefit for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), yet approximately 60% of patients do not respond or eventually relapse.

Data are limited regarding its characteristics, clinical course, and risk factors because of underrecognition and changes in classification. We evaluated 3542 consecutive adult recipients of first HCTs at 24 Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) centers between January 2014 and August 2021 to better describe the clinical evolution and outcomes of late acute GVHD. The cumulative incidence of classic acute GVHD that required systemic treatment was 35.2%, and an additional 5.7% of patients required treatment for late acute GVHD. At the onset of symptoms, late acute GVHD was more severe than classic acute GVHD based on both clinical and MAGIC algorithm probability biomarker parameters and showed a lower overall response rate on day 28. Both clinical and biomarker grading at the time of treatment stratified the risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in patients with classic and late acute GVHD, respectively, but long-term NRM and overall survival did not differ between patients with classic and late acute GVHD. Advanced age, female-to-male sex mismatch, and the use of reduced intensity conditioning were associated with the development of late acute GVHD, whereas the use of posttransplant cyclophosphamide-based GVHD prevention was protective mainly because of shifts in GVHD timing. Because overall outcomes were comparable, our findings, although not definitive, suggest that similar treatment strategies, including eligibility for clinical trials, based solely on clinical presentation at onset are appropriate.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Male", "Female", "Incidence", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Acute Disease", "Biomarkers", "Risk Factors"],

"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the main cause of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Ann Arbor (AA) scores derived from serum biomarkers at onset of GVHD quantify GI crypt damage; AA2/3 scores correlate with resistance to treatment and higher NRM. We conducted a multicenter, phase 2 study using natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell trafficking to the GI tract through the \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, combined with corticosteroids as primary treatment for patients with new onset AA2/3 GVHD. Seventy-five patients who were evaluable were enrolled and treated; 81% received natalizumab within 2\u00a0days of starting corticosteroids. Therapy was well tolerated with no treatment emergent adverse events in >10% of patients. Outcomes for patients treated with natalizumab plus corticosteroids were compared with 150 well-matched controls from the MAGIC database whose primary treatment was corticosteroids alone. There were no significant differences in overall or complete response between patients treated with natalizumab plus corticosteroids and those treated with corticosteroids alone (60% vs 58%; P\u00a0= .67% and 48% vs 48%; P\u00a0= 1.0, respectively) including relevant subgroups.

This study aimed to determine a blood biomarker signature early post-HCT that identifies patients at high risk for VOD/SOS. A set of 23 plasma biomarkers, selected from the VOD/SOS literature, was measured on days 0, 7, and 14 after myeloablative HCT using blood samples from patients enrolled in the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Protocol 1202. Eligible cases were diagnosed with VOD/SOS in BMT CTN 1202 using the Baltimore criteria. Controls (without VOD/SOS) were matched to cases for conditioning regimen and age. Significant biomarkers were identified using the Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P \u2264 .002). Thirty-three patients with mild or severe VOD/SOS were identified (cases) and matched to 107 controls. Two, 8, and 5 biomarkers measured from the plasma of these patients were significantly associated with the development of VOD/SOS at days 0, 7, and 14, respectively, with the strongest associations on days 7 and 14. Biomarker associations were stronger for severe VOD/SOS risk and were stronger prognostic markers for VOD/SOS cases occurring within 28 days of HCT. Hyaluronan was most strongly associated with VOD/SOS risk, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of .81 on day 7 and .79 on day 14. Multivariate models of up to 5 biomarkers generated AUCs ranging from .82 to .85. All associations with VOD/SOS risk were independent of clinical risk factors. This study confirms previously identified biomarkers of VOD/SOS risk and identified novel prognostic biomarker signatures that identify patients at risk for VOD/SOS shortly after HCT. Multivariate analysis suggests that a combination of up to 5 of these protein biomarkers may provide a prognostic tool for identifying patients at risk for VOD/SOS.", "Keywords": ["Biomarkers", "Defibrotide", "Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome", "Veno-occlusive disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease", "Bone Marrow", "Prognosis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Transplants"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Santosh", "Last Name": "Putta", "Affiliation": "BioLegend, Foster City, California."}, {"First Name": "Bradford A", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "B.A.Y.

We used validated clinical and biomarker staging criteria to identify a group of patients with low-risk (LR) GVHD that is very likely to respond to SCS. We hypothesized that itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, would effectively treat LR GVHD without SCS. We treated 70 patients with LR GVHD in a multicenter, phase 2 trial (NCT03846479) with 28 days of itacitinib 200 mg/d (responders could receive a second 28-day cycle), and we compared their outcomes to those of 140 contemporaneous, matched control patients treated with SCSs. More patients responded to itacitinib within 7 days (81% vs 66%, P\u00a0= .02), and response rates at day 28 were very high for both groups (89% vs 86%, P\u00a0= .67), with few symptomatic flares (11% vs 12%, P\u00a0= .88). Fewer itacitinib-treated patients developed a serious infection within 90 days (27% vs 42%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) due to fewer viral and fungal infections. Grade \u22653 cytopenias were similar between groups except for less severe leukopenia with itacitinib (16% vs 31%, P\u00a0= .02).

We prospectively collected serum samples of newly diagnosed GVHD patients (n = 730) from 19 centers, divided them into training (n = 352) and validation (n = 378) cohorts, and measured TNFR1, TIM3, IL6, ST2, and REG3\u03b1 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Performances of the 4 strongest algorithms from the training cohort (TNFR1 + TIM3, TNFR1 + ST2, TNFR1 + REG3\u03b1, and ST2 + REG3\u03b1) were evaluated in the validation cohort.

The relative contributions of antibiotic use and alloreactivity to microbiome dynamics have not yet been elucidated, however. There is a lack of data on the kinetics of microbiome changes beyond 30 days post-transplantation and how they might differ between different transplantation modalities. A direct comparison of the differential effects of auto-HCT and allo-HCT on the microbiome may shed light on these dynamics. This study was conducted to compare intestinal microbial diversity between auto-HCT recipients and allo-HCT recipients from pre-transplantation to 100 days post-transplantation, and to examine the effect of antibiotics,\u00a0transplant type\u00a0(auto versus allo), and conditioning regimens on the dynamics of microbiome recovery. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of changes in the intestinal microbiome in 35 patients undergoing HCT (17 auto-HCT, 18 allo-HCT) at 4 time points: pre-conditioning and 14, 28, and 100 days post-transplantation. Granular data on antibiotic exposure from day -30 pre-transplantation to day +100 post-transplantation were collected. Pre-transplantation, allo-HCT recipients had lower \u03b1-diversity in the intestinal microbiome compared with auto-HCT recipients, which correlated with greater pre-transplantation antibiotic use in allo-HCT recipients. The microbiome diversity declined at days +14 and +28 post-transplantation in both cohorts but generally returned to baseline by day +100. Conditioning regimen intensity did not significantly affect post-transplantation \u03b1-diversity. Through differential abundance analysis, we show that commensal bacterial taxa involved with maintenance of gut epithelial integrity and production of short-chain fatty acids were depleted after both auto-HCT and allo-HCT. In our dataset, antibiotic exposure was the major driver of post-transplantation microbiome changes rather than alloreactivity, conditioning intensity, or immunosuppression. Our findings also suggest that interventions to limit microbiome injury, such as limiting the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, should target the pre-transplantation period and not only the peri-transplantation period.", "Keywords": ["Allogeneic transplantation", "Antibiotics", "Autologous transplantation", "Microbiome"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rajat", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Heekuk", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cristian C", "Last Name": "Taborda", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Gordillo", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Amer", "Last Name": "Assal", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.

The dominant mechanism responsible for this shift has not been elucidated. We took a multifaceted approach to evaluating the clinical and immunologic impact of low vitamin D levels in 53 HCT recipients. We used 28-plex flow cytometry for immunophenotyping, serum cytokine levels, T-cell cytokine production, and T-cell whole genome transcription. The median day-30 vitamin D level was 20 ng/mL, and deficiency was common in younger patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation. Low vitamin D levels were associated with a high CD8/Treg ratio, increased serum levels and T-cell production of proinflammatory cytokines, and a gene expression signature of unrestrained T-cell proliferation and epigenetic modulation through the PRC2/EZH2 complex. Immunophenotyping confirmed a strong association between high levels of vitamin D and an activated EZH2 signature, characterized by overexpression of ID3, which has a role in effector T-cell differentiation. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of vitamin D in modulating T-cell function in human GVHD and identify a previously undescribed interaction with EZH2 and ID3, which may impact effector differentiation and has implications to cell therapies and other forms of cancer immunotherapy. \u00a9 20XX American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

(GVHD) is a major cause of mortality in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. The skin is the most commonly involved organ in GVHD. Elafin, a protease inhibitor overexpressed in inflamed epidermis, was previously identified as a diagnostic biomarker of skin GVHD; however, this finding was restricted to a subset of patients with isolated skin GVHD. The main driver of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in HCT recipients is gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD. Two biomarkers, Regenerating islet-derived 3a (REG3\u03b1) and Suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 (ST2), have been validated as biomarkers of GI GVHD that predict long-term outcomes in patients treated for GVHD. We undertook this study to determine the utility of elafin as a prognostic biomarker in the general population of acute GVHD patients in whom GVHD may develop in multiple organs. We analyzed serum elafin concentrations as a predictive biomarker of acute GVHD outcomes and compared it with ST2 and REG3\u03b1 in a large group of patients treated at multiple centers. A total of 526 patients from the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) who had received corticosteroid treatment for skin GVHD and who had not been previously studied were analyzed. Serum concentrations of elafin, ST2, and REG3\u03b1 were measured by ELISA in all patients. The patients were divided at random into equal training and validation sets, and a competing-risk regression model was developed to model 6-month NRM using elafin concentration in the training set. Additional models were developed using concentrations of ST2 and REG3\u03b1 or the combination of all 3 biomarkers as predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the validation set to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model and to stratify patients into high- and low-risk biomarker groups. The cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM, overall survival (OS), and 4-week treatment response were compared between the risk groups. Unexpectedly, patients in the low-risk elafin group demonstrated a higher incidence of 6-month NRM, although the difference was not statistically significant (17% versus 11%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.19). OS at 6 months (68% versus 68%; P > .99) and 4-week response (78% versus 78%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.98) were similar in the low-risk and high-risk elafin groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.55 for elafin and 0.75 for the combination of ST2 and REG3\u03b1. The addition of elafin to the other 2 biomarkers did not improve the AUC. Our data indicate that serum elafin concentrations measured at the initiation of systemic treatment for acute GVHD did not predict 6-month NRM, OS, or treatment response in a multicenter population of patients treated systemically for acute GVHD. As seen in previous studies, serum concentrations of the GI GVHD biomarkers ST2 and REG3\u03b1 were significant predictors of NRM, and the addition of elafin levels did not improve their accuracy. These results underscore the importance of GI disease in driving NRM in patients who develop acute GVHD.", "Keywords": ["Graft-versus-host disease", "biomarkers", "hematopoietic cell

We aimed to compare the 2 most commonly used RIC regimens, i.v. fludarabine with busulfan (FluBu) and fludarabine with melphalan (FluMel), in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), we identified 1045 MDS patients age \u226560 years who underwent first HSCT with a matched related or matched (8/8) unrelated donor using an RIC regimen. The CIBMTR's definition of RIC was used: a regimen that incorporated an i.v. busulfan total dose \u22647.2 mg/kg or a low-dose melphalan total dose \u2264150 mg/m2. The 2 groups, recipients of FluBu (n\u00a0=\u00a0697) and recipients of FluMel (n\u00a0=\u00a0448), were comparable in terms of disease- and transplantation-related characteristics except for the more frequent use of antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab in the FluBu group (39% versus 31%). The median age was 67 years in both groups. FluMel was associated with a reduced relapse incidence (RI) compared with FluBu, with a 1-year adjusted incidence of 26% versus 44%\u00a0(P \u2264 .0001). Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the FluMel group (26% versus 16%; P \u2264 .0001). Because the magnitude of improvement with FluMel in RI was greater than the improvement in TRM with FluBu, disease-free survival (DFS) was better at 1 year and beyond with FluMel compared with FluBu (48% versus 40% at 1 year [P\u00a0=\u00a0.02] and 35% versus 27% at 3 years [P\u00a0=\u00a0.01]). Overall survival was comparable in the 2 groups at 1 year (63% versus 61%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.4) but was significantly improved with FluMel compared with FluBu at 3 years (46% versus 39%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Our results suggest that FluMel is associated with superior DFS compared with FluBu owing to reduced RI in older patients with MDS patients. \u00a9 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

cyclophosphamide (PTCy) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has enabled haploidentical (Haplo) transplantation to be performed with results similar to those after matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation with traditional prophylaxis. The relative value of transplantation with MUD vs Haplo donors when both groups receive PTCy/calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis is not known. We compared outcomes after 2036 Haplo and 284 MUD transplantations with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in adults from 2011 through 2018. Cox regression models were built to compare outcomes between donor types. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens were analyzed separately. Among recipients of reduced-intensity regimens, 2-year graft failure (3% vs 11%), acute grades 2 to 4 GVHD (hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; P = .022), acute grades 3 and 4 GVHD (HR, 0.41; P = .016), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.43; P = .0008) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. Consequently, disease-free (HR, 0.74; P = .008; 55% vs 41%) and overall (HR, 0.65; P = .001; 67% vs 54%) survival were higher with MUD than with Haplo transplants. Among recipients of myeloablative regimens, day-100 platelet recovery (95% vs 88%) was higher and grades 3 and 4 acute (HR, 0.39; P = .07) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.66; P = .05) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation.

Grade \u2265 2 diarrhea was associated with longer duration of diarrhea, longer length of stay, worse hypoalbuminemia, higher use of antibiotics, abdominal imaging, electrolyte repletions, and anti-diarrheal agents. Risk factors for severe diarrhea were female sex, melphalan dose, age > 50, creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min, and having a plasma cell neoplasm as opposed to lymphoma. Female sex was also associated with more severe nausea and vomiting. In summary, diarrhea remains an important toxicity of HDM and novel therapies for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea for patients undergoing stem-cell transplantation are needed. Grade 2 or higher diarrhea is associated with significant clinical consequences and should be used as the primary endpoint in prospective clinical trials.", "Keywords": ["Diarrhea", "Gastrointestinal toxicity", "Melphalan"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Benchmarking", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Melphalan", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Therapies, Investigational", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Autologous", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian A", "Last Name": "Gordillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sapna", "Last Name": "Parmar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miranda", "Last Name": "Blanco", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elsa M", "Last Name": "Delille", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 620 West 168th Street Mailbox 127, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amer", "Last Name": "Assal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 620 West 168th Street Mailbox 127, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. ran.reshef@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Annals of hematology", "PubDate": "2021Jul"}, {"PMID": "33351103", "Title": "Biomarker-guided preemption of steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease with \u03b1-1-antitrypsin.", "Abstract": "Steroid-refractory (SR) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but its occurrence is not accurately predicted by pre-HCT clinical risk factors. The Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) algorithm probability (MAP) identifies patients who are at high risk for developing SR GVHD as early as 7 days after HCT based on the extent of intestinal crypt damage as measured by the concentrations of 2 serum biomarkers, suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 and regenerating islet-derived 3\u03b1. We conducted a multicenter proof-of-concept \"preemptive\" treatment trial of \u03b1-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor with demonstrated activity against GVHD, in patients at high risk for developing SR GVHD. Patients were eligible if they possessed a high-risk MAP on day 7 after HCT or, if initially low risk, became high risk on repeat testing at day 14. Thirty high-risk patients were treated with twice-weekly infusions of AAT for a total of 16 doses, and their outcomes were compared with 90 high-risk near-contemporaneous MAGIC control patients. AAT treatment was well tolerated with few toxicities, but it did not lower the incidence of SR GVHD compared with controls (20% vs 14%, P = .56). We conclude that real-time biomarker-based risk assignment is feasible early after allogeneic HCT but that this dose and schedule of AAT did not change the incidence of SR acute GVHD.

validated response biomarker of treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease.", "Abstract": "The Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) algorithm probability (MAP), derived from 2 serum biomarkers, measures damage to crypts in the gastrointestinal tract during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We hypothesized that changes in MAP after treatment could validate it as a response biomarker. We prospectively collected serum samples and clinical stages of acute GVHD from 615 patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation in 20 centers at initiation of first-line systemic treatment and 4 weeks later. We computed MAPs and clinical responses and compared their abilities to predict 6-month nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in the validation cohort (n = 367). After 4 weeks of treatment, MAPs predicted NRM better than the change in clinical symptoms in all patients and identified 2 groups with significantly different NRM in both clinical responders (40% vs 12%, P < .0001) and nonresponders (65% vs 25%, P < .0001). MAPs successfully reclassified patients for NRM risk within every clinical grade of acute GVHD after 4 weeks of treatment. At the beginning of treatment, patients with a low MAP that rose above the threshold of 0.290 after 4 weeks of treatment had a significant increase in NRM, whereas patients with a high MAP at onset that fell below that threshold after treatment had a striking decrease in NRM that translated into clear differences in overall survival. We conclude that a MAP measured before and after treatment of acute GVHD is a response biomarker that predicts long-term outcomes more accurately than change in clinical symptoms. MAPs have the potential to guide therapy for acute GVHD and may function as a useful end point in clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Algorithms", "Biomarkers", "Graft

transplantation (HCT) is associated with improved outcomes for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In this registry study, we analyzed clinical outcomes of 390 adult patients with CML who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2014 and received maintenance TKI following HCT (n\u202f=\u202f89) compared with no TKI maintenance (n\u202f=\u202f301), as reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. All patients received TKI therapy before HCT. The majority of patients had a disease status of first chronic phase at HCT (n\u202f=\u202f240; 62%). The study was conducted as a landmark analysis, excluding patients who died, relapsed, had chronic graft-versus-host disease, or were censored before day +100 following HCT. Of the 89 patients who received TKI maintenance, 77 (87%) received a single TKI and the other 12 (13%) received multiple sequential TKIs. The most common TKIs used for maintenance were dasatinib (n\u202f=\u202f50), imatinib (n\u202f=\u202f27), and nilotinib (n\u202f=\u202f27). As measured from day +100, the adjusted estimates for 5-year relapse (maintenance, 35% versus no maintenance, 26%; P\u202f=\u202f.11), leukemia-free survival (maintenance, 42% versus no maintenance, 44%; P\u202f=\u202f.65), or overall survival (maintenance, 61% versus no maintenance, 57%; P\u202f=\u202f.61) did not differ significantly between patients receiving TKI maintenance or no maintenance. These results remained unchanged in multivariate analysis and were not modified by disease status before transplantation. In conclusion, our data from this day +100 landmark analysis do not demonstrate a significant impact of maintenance TKI therapy on clinical outcomes. The optimal approach to TKI administration in the post-transplantation setting in patients with CML remains undetermined.", "Keywords": ["Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation", "Chronic myelogenous leukemia", "Maintenance", "Tyrosine kinase inhibitor"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Imatinib Mesylate", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zachariah", "Last Name": "DeFilipp", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

No study thus far has demonstrated an effective way to predict adherence in SCT recipients. A structured rating scale, the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT), has been shown to predict psychosocial outcomes and medical morbidity in solid organ transplant recipients. We assessed the SIPAT in SCT recipients. We hypothesized that the SIPAT rating would be associated with nonadherence to the post-SCT regimen. We retrospectively studied SCT recipients who had psychiatric evaluations with the SIPAT before SCT. The primary outcome was nonadherence, defined a priori as at least 1 life-threatening nonadherence event in the first 6 months post-transplant. Association of the SIPAT with outcomes was evaluated by logistic regression, and an optimal cutoff score was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Of 85 patients (mean age 47 years; range, 18 to 74 years), 56 (66%) were male, and 43 (50.5%) received autologous SCT. Eighteen (21%) patients were nonadherent. The SIPAT rating, treated as a continuous variable and controlling for autologous versus allogeneic SCT, was significantly associated with nonadherence (per 1 point; odds ratio [OR], 1.162; P< .0001). Allogeneic SCT also conferred a significantly increased risk of nonadherence (OR, 14.184; P= .005). Multivariate analysis stratifying for allogeneic versus autologous transplantation and controlling for age, sex, and disease confirmed an independent association between the SIPAT score and nonadherence. A cutoff score of 18 provided optimal specificity (89.6%) and sensitivity (55.6%) for nonadherence. Nonadherence rates were 58.8% and 11.8% for subjects with SIPAT ratings of 18 and above or 17 and below, respectively (relative risk = 4.98, P < .0001). Psychosocial risk as quantified by the SIPAT correlated with SCT recipients' adherence to the post-transplant regimen, suggesting that this instrument can contribute to medical risk stratification models. Further study should evaluate long-term mortality data and the effects of intervention on psychosocial risks.", "Keywords": ["Adherence", "SIPAT", "Stem Cell transplant"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Allografts", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Psychology", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adrienne D", "Last Name": "Mishkin", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we identified 2736 adult patients who underwent first allogeneic PBSC transplantation for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2008 and 2014 using an HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) or an 8/8-matched unrelated donor (MUD). We excluded ex vivo and in vivo T cell-depleted transplantations. Correlative analysis was performed between CD3+ T cell dose and the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Using maximum likelihood estimation, we identified CD3+ T cell dose cutoff that separated the risk of acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II-IV in both the MSD and MUD groups. A CD3+ T cell dose cutoff of 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f107 cells/kg identified MSD/low CD3+ (n\u202f=\u202f223) and MSD/high CD3+ (n\u202f=\u202f1214), and a dose of 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f107 cells/kg identified MUD/low CD3+ (n\u202f=\u202f197) and MUD/high CD3+ (n\u202f=\u202f1102). On univariate analysis, the MSD/high CD3+ group had a higher cumulative incidence of day +100 aGVHD grade II-IV compared with the MSD/low CD3+ group (33% versus 25%; P\u202f=\u202f.009). There were no differences between the 2 groups in engraftment rate, risk of aGVHD grade III-IV or chronic GVHD (cGVHD), NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS. The MUD/high CD3+ group had a higher cumulative incidence of day +100 aGVHD grade II-IV compared with the MUD/low CD3+ group (49% versus 41%; P\u202f=\u202f.04). There were no differences between the 2 groups in engraftment rate, risk of severe aGVHD or cGVHD, NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS. Multivariate analysis of the MSD and MUD groups failed to show an association between CD3+ T cell dose and the risk of either aGVHD grade II-IV (P\u202f=\u202f.10 and .07, respectively) or cGVHD (P\u202f=\u202f.80 and .30, respectively). Subanalysis of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio failed to identify cutoff values predictive of transplantation outcomes; however, using the log-rank test, the sample size was suboptimal for identifying a difference at this cutoff cell dose. In this registry study, the CD3+ T cell dose of PBSC products did not influence the risk of aGVHD or cGVHD or other transplantation outcomes when using an MSD or an 8/8-matched MUD.

Lymphocyte migration plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. A previous phase I/II trial demonstrated that CCR5 blockade with maraviroc in the first 30days after allo-HCT resulted in a low incidence of early acute GVHD, primarily in visceral organs, but with no impact on late acute or chronic GVHD. We conducted a phase II trial to examine the efficacy of an extended course of maraviroc, administered through post-transplantation day +90 in addition to standard prophylaxis in 37 recipients of reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT performed to treat hematologic malignancies. Extended maraviroc treatment was safe and feasible. The primary study endpoint, day +180 rate of grade II-IV acute GVHD, was 22 \u00b1 7%, liver GVHD was not observed, and gut GVHD was uncommon. The day +180 rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 5 \u00b1 4%. The 1-year rate of moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 8 \u00b1 5% and that of disease relapse was 30 \u00b1 8%. Overall survival at 1 year was 70 \u00b1 8%. Compared with the previously studied short course of maraviroc, the extended course resulted in a significantly higher GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], .45; 95% confidence interval [CI], .25 to .82; P\u202f=\u202f.009) and overall survival (adjusted HR, .48; 95% CI, .24 to .96; P\u202f=\u202f.037). A combined analysis of both trials showed that high maraviroc trough concentrations on the day of hematopoietic cell infusion were associated with lower rates of acute GVHD. An extended course of maraviroc after reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT is safe and effective in preventing acute and chronic GVHD and is associated with favorable survival.", "Keywords": ["C-C Chemokine Receptor Type 5", "Graft-versus-Host Disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "CCR5 Receptor Antagonists", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Maraviroc", "Middle Aged", "Receptors, CCR5", "Survival Analysis", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Treatment Outcome", "Unrelated Donors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Division of Hematology/Oncology and Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

currently diagnosed and treated.", "Abstract": "Upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease is reported in approximately 30% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients developing acute graft-versus-host disease. Currently classified as Grade II in consensus criteria, upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease is often treated with systemic immunosuppression. We reviewed the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database to assess the prognostic implications of upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease in isolation or with other acute graft-versus-host disease manifestations. 8567 adult recipients of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant receiving T-cell replete grafts for acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. 51% of transplants were from unrelated donors. Reported upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease incidence was 12.1%; 2.7% of recipients had isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease, of whom 95% received systemic steroids. Patients with isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement had similar survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse as patients with Grades 0, I, or II acute graft-versus-host disease. Unrelated donor recipients with isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease had less subsequent chronic graft-versus-host disease than those with Grades I or II disease (P=0.016 and P=0.0004, respectively). Upper gastrointestinal involvement added no significant prognostic information when present in addition to other manifestations of Grades I or II acute graft-versus-host disease. If upper gastrointestinal symptoms were reclassified as Grade 0 or I, 425 of 2083 patients (20.4%) with Grade II disease would be downgraded, potentially impacting the interpretation of clinical trial outcomes. Defining upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease as a Grade II entity, as it is currently diagnosed and treated, is not strongly supported by this analysis. The general approach to diagnosis, treatment and grading of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and their impact on subsequent acute graft-versus-host disease therapy warrants reevaluation.", "Keywords":

of adult posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder: Changes in histology between 1999 and 2013.", "Abstract": "Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) typically presents with either polymorphic or monomorphic histology. While both are the end result of immunosuppressive therapies, their origins are felt to be different with different prognoses and responsiveness to therapy, resulting in 2 different malignancies. We attempted to confirm reports suggesting that the relative frequency of these 2 histologies is shifting over time. We analyzed 3040 adult PTLD cases in the UNOS OPTN database from 1999 to 2013. Changes in PTLD cases over time were analyzed for histology, time from transplant to diagnosis, and patient EBV serostatus. We found that the relative proportion of polymorphic versus monomorphic histology has changed with an increase in the proportion of monomorphic cases with time (1999-2003, 54.9% vs. 45.1%; 2004-2008, 58.3% vs. 41.7%; 2009-2013, 69.7% vs. 30.3%; P\u2009=\u2009<.001). The change is driven by a gradual increase in the number of monomorphic PTLD with a steady number of polymorphic PTLD. The change is most strongly seen in transplant recipients who were EBV serostatus positive at the time of transplant. Potential causes are changes in immunosuppressive regimens with increased tacrolimus use (P\u2009=\u2009.009) and increased survival among transplant patients leading to later occurrence of PTLD (P\u2009=\u2009.001) that have occurred during the time frame analyzed.

Clinical response after 1 week of therapy often guides further treatment decisions, but long-term outcomes vary widely among centers, and more accurate predictive tests are urgently needed. We analyzed clinical data and blood samples taken 1 week after systemic treatment of GVHD from 507 patients from 17 centers of the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC), dividing them into a test cohort (n = 236) and 2 validation cohorts separated in time (n = 142 and n = 129). Initial response to systemic steroids correlated with response at 4 weeks, 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and overall survival (OS). A previously validated algorithm of 2 MAGIC biomarkers (ST2 and REG3\u03b1) consistently separated steroid-resistant patients into 2 groups with dramatically different NRM and OS (P < .001 for all 3 cohorts). High biomarker probability, resistance to steroids, and GVHD severity (Minnesota risk) were all significant predictors of NRM in multivariate analysis. A direct comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the area under the curve for biomarker probability (0.82) was significantly greater than that for steroid response (0.68, P = .004) and for Minnesota risk (0.72, P = .005). In conclusion, MAGIC biomarker probabilities generated after 1 week of systemic treatment of GVHD predict long-term outcomes in steroid-resistant GVHD better than clinical criteria and should prove useful in developing better treatment strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug

Several studies have suggested a role for T cell doses in peripheral blood stem cell grafts in RIC HSCT. Because T cell dose is typically not known until after the collection, and apheresis blood volume is easily modifiable, we hypothesized that higher donor apheresis blood volumes would improve transplantation outcomes through an effect on graft composition. Thus, we analyzed the relationships between apheresis volume, graft composition, and transplantation outcomes in 142 consecutive patients undergoing unrelated donor allogeneic RIC HSCT. We found that apheresis volume \u226515 L was associated with a significantly decreased risk of relapse (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], .48; 95% confidence interval [CI], .28 to .84]; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and improved relapse-free survival (aHR, .56; 95% CI, .35 to .89; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and overall survival (aHR, .55; 95% CI, .34 to .91; P\u2009=\u2009.02).

Epigenetic mechanisms are thought to be important for balancing effector and memory differentiation; however, the epigenetic regulator(s) underpinning this process remains unknown. Herein, we show that the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 controls CD8+ T memory precursor formation and antitumor activity. Ezh2 activates Id3 while silencing Id2, Prdm1 and Eomes, promoting the expansion of memory precursor cells and their differentiation into functional memory cells. Akt activation phosphorylates Ezh2 and decreases its control of these transcriptional programs, causing enhanced effector differentiation at the expense of T memory precursors. Engineering T cells with an Akt-insensitive Ezh2 mutant markedly improves their memory potential and capability of controlling tumor growth compared to transiently inhibiting Akt. These findings establish Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Ezh2 as a critical target to potentiate antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Immunologic Memory", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neoplasms, Experimental", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA. shan.he@temple.edu."}, {"First Name": "Yongnian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongxing", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janaki", "Last Name": "Purushe", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "The Division of Endocrinology and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Changhong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "The Division of Endocrinology and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jozef", "Last Name": "Madzo", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Pierre", "Last Name": "Issa", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Soboloff", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bethany", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Gattinoni", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA. yi.zhang@temple.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2017Dec14"}, {"PMID": "29128025", "Title": "Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder in Solid Organ and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.", "Abstract": "Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) represent an immunosuppression-related lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferation that occur in the setting of solid organ transplant or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

We report a prospective, double-blind phase III trial to investigate the effect of ATLG (Neovii Biotech, Lexington, MA) on cGVHD-free survival. Patients and Methods Two hundred fifty-four patients 18 to 65 years of age with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were randomly assigned one to one to placebo (n =128 placebo) or ATLG (n = 126) treatment at 27 sites. Patients received either ATLG or placebo 20 mg/kg per day on days -3, -2, -1 in addition to tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The primary study end point was moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Results Despite a reduction in grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (23% v 40%; P = .004) and moderate-severe cGVHD (12% v 33%; P < .001) in ATLG recipients, no difference in moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival between ATLG and placebo was found (2-year estimate: 48% v 44%, respectively; P = .47). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower with ATLG (2-year estimate: 47% v 65% [ P = .04] and 59% v 74% [ P = .034], respectively). Multivariable analysis confirmed that ATLG was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.28; P = .026) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.71; P = .01). Conclusion In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of ATLG in unrelated myeloablative HCT, the incorporation of ATLG did not improve moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Moderate-severe cGVHD was significantly lower with ATLG, but PFS and OS also were lower. Additional analyses are needed to understand the appropriate role for ATLG in HCT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antilymphocyte Serum", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "HLA Antigens", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Middle Aged", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Prospective Studies", "Tacrolimus", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Soiffer", "Affiliation": "Robert J.

Genetic deletion of T-cell Ezh2, which catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), inhibits GVHD. Therefore, reducing Ezh2-mediated H3K27me3 is thought to be essential for inhibiting GVHD. We tested this hypothesis in mouse GVHD models. Unexpectedly, administration of the Ezh2 inhibitor GSK126, which specifically decreases H3K27me3 without affecting Ezh2 protein, failed to prevent the disease. In contrast, destabilizing T-cell Ezh2 protein by inhibiting Hsp90 using its specific inhibitor AUY922 reduced GVHD in mice undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In vivo administration of AUY922 selectively induced apoptosis of activated T cells and decreased the production of effector cells producing interferon \u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, similar to genetic deletion of Ezh2. Introduction of Ezh2 into alloreactive T cells restored their expansion and production of effector cytokines upon AUY922 treatment, suggesting that impaired T-cell alloreactivity by inhibiting Hsp90 is achieved mainly through depleting Ezh2. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the enzymatic SET domain of Ezh2 directly interacted with Hsp90 to prevent Ezh2 from rapid degradation in activated T cells. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 preserved antileukemia activity of donor T cells, leading to improved overall survival of recipient mice after allogeneic HSCT. Our findings identify the Ezh2-Hsp90 interaction as a previously unrecognized mechanism essential for T-cell responses and an effective target for controlling GVHD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein", "Graft vs Host Disease", "HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Histones", "Indoles", "Isoxazoles", "Lysine", "Methylation", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Minor Histocompatibility Antigens", "Protein Domains", "Protein Stability", "Pyridones", "Resorcinols", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qingrong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuting", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Pan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Changhong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Jiefang", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongnian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Hongshuang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaoyan", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Institutes for Translational Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Anqi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacological Sciences and."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacological Sciences and."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Hexner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Fung", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology/Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple Health, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Yanyun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2017May18"}, {"PMID": "28194439", "Title": "An early-biomarker algorithm predicts lethal graft-versus-host disease and survival.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. No laboratory test can predict the risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) or severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic cellular transplantation (HCT) prior to the onset of GVHD symptoms. METHODS. Patient blood samples on day 7 after HCT were obtained from a multicenter set of 1,287 patients, and 620 samples were assigned to a training set. We measured the concentrations of 4 GVHD biomarkers (ST2, REG3\u03b1, TNFR1, and IL-2R\u03b1) and used them to model 6-month NRM using rigorous cross-validation strategies to identify the best algorithm that defined 2 distinct risk groups. We then applied the final algorithm in an independent test set (n = 309) and validation set (n = 358). RESULTS. A 2-biomarker model using ST2 and REG3\u03b1 concentrations identified patients with a cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM of 28% in the high-risk group and 7% in the low-risk group (P < 0.001). The algorithm performed equally well in the test set (33% vs. 7%, P < 0.001) and the multicenter validation set (26% vs. 10%, P < 0.001). Sixteen percent, 17%, and 20% of patients were at high risk in the training, test, and validation sets, respectively. GVHD-related mortality was greater in high-risk patients (18% vs. 4%, P < 0.001), as was severe gastrointestinal GVHD (17% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). The same algorithm can be successfully adapted to define 3 distinct risk groups at GVHD onset. CONCLUSION. A biomarker algorithm based on a blood sample taken 7 days after HCT can consistently identify a group of patients at high risk for lethal GVHD and NRM. FUNDING.

exist regarding prognostic factors and transplantation outcomes. We performed this retrospective study to identify prognostic factors for post-transplantation outcomes. The CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) has been validated in subjects receiving nontransplantation therapy and was included in our study. From 2001 to 2012, 209 adult subjects who received HCT for CMML were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The median age at transplantation was 57 years (range, 23 to 74). Median follow-up was 51 months (range, 3 to 122). On multivariate analyses, CPSS scores, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and graft source were significant predictors of survival (P\u2009=\u2009.004, P\u2009=\u2009.01, P\u2009=\u2009.01, respectively). Higher CPSS scores were not associated with disease-free survival, relapse, or transplantation-related mortality. In a restricted analysis of subjects with relapse after HCT, those with intermediate-2/high risk had a nearly 2-fold increased risk of death after relapse compared to those with low/intermediate-1 CPSS scores. Respective 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates for low/intermediate-1 risk subjects were 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 72%), 48% (95% CI, 37% to 59%), and 44% (95% CI, 33% to 55%), and for intermediate-2/high risk subjects were 38% (95% CI, 28% to 49%), 32% (95% CI, 21% to 42%), and 19% (95% CI, 8% to 29%). We conclude that higher CPSS score at time of transplantation, lower KPS, and a bone marrow graft are associated with inferior survival after HCT.

transplantation (allo-HSCT). Lymphocyte trafficking via chemokine receptors such as CCR5 plays a critical role in alloreactive responses, and previous data suggest that CCR5 blockade with maraviroc results in a low incidence of visceral GVHD. However, the full scope of clinical and immunologic effects of CCR5 blockade in HSCT has not been described. We compared a cohort of patients enrolled on a trial of reduced-intensity allo-HSCT with standard GVHD prophylaxis plus maraviroc to a contemporary control cohort receiving standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. Maraviroc treatment was associated with a lower incidence of acute GVHD without increased risk of disease relapse, as well as reduced levels of gut-specific markers. At day 30, maraviroc treatment increased CCR5 expression on T cells and dampened T-cell activation in peripheral blood without impairing early immune reconstitution or increasing risk for infections. Patients who developed acute GVHD despite maraviroc prophylaxis showed increased T-cell activation, naive T-cell skewing, and elevated serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels. Collectively, these data suggest that maraviroc effectively protects against GVHD by modulating alloreactive donor T-cell responses, and that CXCR3 signaling may be an important resistance mechanism to CCR5 blockade in GVHD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "CCR5 Receptor Antagonists", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunity, Cellular", "Interleukin-15", "Lectins, C-Type", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins", "Receptors, CCR5", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan H", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Austin P", "Last Name": "Huffman", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Lee P", "Last Name": "Richman", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Crisalli", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Ximi K", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology and."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Hoxie", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Rosemarie", "Last Name": "Mick", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Vonderheide", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2017Feb16"}, {"PMID": "27496363", "Title": "Precision in donor selection: Identifying ideal stem-cell donors through their T\u00a0cells.", "Abstract": "HLA-identical siblings have always been considered ideal donors for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the treatment of hematologic cancers. Recent data suggest that we should rethink this paradigm. In \"High Graft CD8+ Cell Dose Predicts Improved Survival and Enables Better Donor Selection in Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation With Reduced-Intensity Conditioning,\" we identified a group of stem-cell donors whose grafts contain an optimal composition of T-cells, leading to a dramatic decrease in disease relapse risk and an improvement in overall survival following allo-HSCT. To demonstrate this, we analyzed the outcomes of 200 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HSCT after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The analysis focused on T-cell content of peripheral blood stem-cell grafts. We found that higher graft CD8+ T-cell dose (CD8hi), a trait found only in grafts collected from young donors, was associated with improved survival due to a reduction in the risk for cancer relapse without a significant increase in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Though not all young donors mobilized CD8hi grafts, we found that a low CD4:CD8 ratio in the peripheral blood could identify these ideal donors prior to transplant. The likelihood of finding CD8hi donors correlated inversely with age, and elderly RIC transplant recipients had a low chance of receiving an ideal graft from their similarly aged siblings. Here, we examine these findings and their implications on choosing donors according to age and relatedness. We also explore biological mechanisms that determine the CD4:CD8 ratio in healthy donors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "CD4-CD8 Ratio", "Donor Selection", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Precision Medicine", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation Immunology", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Widman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program and Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the association between the presence of a pathogenic mutation and risk of relapse after alloHSCT. Eighty-six percent (96 of 112) of patients had at least 1 pathogenic mutation. Mutations in TP53, WT1, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) were associated with an increased risk of relapse after alloHSCT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.90; P\u2009=\u2009.009; aHR, 2.51; P=\u2009.02; and aHR, 1.83; P\u2009=\u2009.07, respectively). DNMT3A mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations was associated with a lower relapse risk (aHR, .22; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Comparison of pre-alloHSCT and post-alloHSCT genetic profiles showed clonal evolution in 6 of 6 patients, including acquisition of actionable mutations in 4 patients. In summary, genetic profiling is useful for assessing relapse risk in patients with AML undergoing alloHSCT and may identify patients in need of strategies to reduce this risk. Clonal evolution is present at post-alloHSCT relapse and repeat genetic profiling may uncover acquired actionable mutations.", "Keywords": ["Acute myeloid leukemia", "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation", "Next-generation sequencing", "Relapse"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "DNA Methyltransferase 3A", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Nucleophosmin", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "WT1 Proteins", "Young Adult", "fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marlise R", "Last Name": "Luskin", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Carroll", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J D", "Last Name": "Morrissette", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Crisalli", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Selina M", "Last Name": "Luger", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program and Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

It is currently unclear if older related donors are better than younger unrelated donors for patients with MDS undergoing RI alloSCT. We retrospectively studied 53 consecutive MDS patients who underwent RI alloSCT between April 2007 and June 2014 and evaluated associations between donor type and outcomes with adjustment for significant covariates. 34 patients (median age: 64 years) and 19 patients (median age: 60 years) received allografts from unrelated and related donors, respectively. Unrelated donors were younger than related donors (median age: 32 vs. 60 years, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). There were no significant differences in baseline disease characteristics of patients receiving allografts from related or unrelated donors. Patients who received allografts from unrelated donors had a lower relapse risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]\u2009=\u20090.35, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and improved relapse-free survival (aHR\u2009=\u20090.47, P\u2009=\u20090.018). HLA mismatched unrelated donors were associated with a higher risk of grade 2-4 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) (HR\u2009=\u20094.64, P\u2009=\u20090.002) without an accompanying increase in the risk of non-relapse mortality (P\u2009=\u20090.56). Unrelated donors provided a higher mean CD8 cell dose (P\u2009=\u20090.014) and were associated with higher median donor T cell chimerism at day 60 (P\u2009=\u20090.003) and day 100 (P\u2009=\u20090.03). In conclusion, patients with MDS who received allografts from unrelated donors had a lower risk of relapse and improved relapse-free survival when compared to patients who received allografts from related donors. These findings should be confirmed in a prospective study. Am. J.

However, induction of alloreactive T cells does not necessarily lead to GVHD. Here we report the development of a cellular programming approach to render alloreactive T cells incapable of causing severe GVHD in both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched and MHC-identical but minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched mouse models. We established a novel platform that produced \u03b4-like ligand 4-positive dendritic cells (Dll4(hi)DCs) from murine bone marrow using Flt3 ligand and Toll-like receptor agonists. Upon allogeneic Dll4(hi)DC stimulation, CD4(+) na\u00efve T cells underwent effector differentiation and produced high levels of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-17 in vitro, depending on Dll4 activation of Notch signaling. Following transfer, allogeneic Dll4(hi)DC-induced T cells were unable to mediate severe GVHD but preserved antileukemic activity, significantly improving the survival of leukemic mice undergoing allogeneic HSCT. This effect of Dll4(hi)DC-induced T cells was associated with their impaired expansion in GVHD target tissues. IFN-\u03b3 was important for Dll4(hi)DC programming to reduce GVHD toxicities of alloreactive T cells. Absence of T-cell IFN-\u03b3 led to improved survival and expansion of Dll4(hi)DC-induced CD4(+) T cells in transplant recipients and caused lethal GVHD. Our findings demonstrate that Dll4(hi)DC programming can overcome GVHD toxicity of donor T cells and produce leukemia-reactive T cells for effective immunotherapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Cellular Reprogramming Techniques", "Dendritic Cells", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Leukemia", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kazuhiro", "Last Name": "Mochizuki", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;"}, {"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;"}, {"First Name": "Izumi", "Last Name": "Mochizuki", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;"}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Yongnian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Janaki", "Last Name": "Purushe", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Fung", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology/Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple Health, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "M Raza", "Last Name": "Zaidi", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Yanyun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;"}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;"}, {"First Name": "Bruce R", "Last Name": "Blazar", "Affiliation": "Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;"}, {"First Name": "Hideo", "Last Name": "Yagita", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan; and."}, {"First Name": "Shin", "Last Name": "Mineishi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2016Jun23"}, {"PMID": "27044940", "Title": "Scoring System Prognostic of Outcome in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndrome.", "Abstract": "To develop a system prognostic of outcome in those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Histocompatibility Testing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian C", "Last Name": "Shaffer", "Affiliation": "Brian C.

The advent of UCB transplantation (UCBT) using two grafts successfully circumvents this obstacle, despite the engraftment of only one unit. Preclinical models suggested that the addition of UCB T cells at the time of transplant can enhance engraftment. We tested whether ex vivo activation by CD3/CD28 costimulation and expansion of T cells from a single UCB graft would be safe and feasible in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies, with an overall objective of optimizing engraftment in single unit UCBT. In this phase 1 study, recipients of single UCB units were eligible if the unit was stored in two adequate fractions. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 or grade 4 GVHD within 90 days of UCBT. Four patients underwent UCBT; all were treated at the first dose level (10(5) cells/kg). At the 10(5) cells/kg dose level two subjects experienced grade 3 intestinal GVHD, thus meeting stopping criteria. For three subjects, neutrophil engraftment was early (12, 17, and 20 days), while one subject experienced primary graft failure. We observed early donor T cell trafficking and found that expanded T cells produced supraphysiologic levels of cytokines relevant to engraftment and to lymphoid differentiation and function. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest rapid engraftment in recipients of a single UCBT combined with relatively low doses of activated T cells, though potentially complicated by severe GVHD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts", "B-Cell Activating Factor", "Blood Preservation", "CD28 Antigens", "CD3 Complex", "Cells, Cultured", "Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation", "Cryopreservation", "Cytokines", "Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Histocompatibility", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Lymphocyte Transfusion", "Male", "Maximum Tolerated Dose", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Neutrophils", "T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth O", "Last Name": "Hexner", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Selina M", "Last Name": "Luger", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Grace R", "Last Name": "Jeschke", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "James K", "Last Name": "Mangan", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Noelle V", "Last Name": "Frey", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Dale M", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Lee P", "Last Name": "Richman", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Vonderheide", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Aqui", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Misha", "Last Name": "Rosenbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Chew", "Affiliation": "Center for Cellular Immunotherapy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Alison W", "Last Name": "Loren", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Edward A", "Last Name": "Stadtmauer", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Bruce L", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Carl H", "Last Name": "June", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Stephen G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "American journal of hematology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26820493", "Title": "Time to unrelated donor leukocyte infusion is longer, but incidence of GVHD and overall survival are similar for recipients of unrelated DLI compared to matched sibling DLI.", "Abstract": "Donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) is used to treat relapsed leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT).

We have recently demonstrated that dendritic cells (DCs) expressing the Notch ligand DLL4 are critical for eliciting alloreactive T cell responses and induction of graft-versus-host disease in mice. However, the human counterpart of murine DLL4(+) DCs has yet to be examined. We report the identification of human DLL4(+) DCs and their critical role in regulating Th1 and Th17 differentiation. CD1c(+) DCs and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) from the peripheral blood (PB) of healthy donors did not express DLL4. In contrast, patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a 16-fold more DLL4(+)CD1c(+) DCs than healthy donors. Upon activation of TLR signaling, healthy donor-derived CD1c(+) DCs dramatically upregulated DLL4, as did pDCs to a lesser extent. Activated DLL4(+) DCs were better able to promote Th1 and Th17 differentiation than unstimulated PB DCs. Blocking DLL4 using a neutralizing Ab decreased Notch signaling in T cells stimulated with DLL4(+) DCs, and it reduced the generation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Both NF-\u03baB and STAT3 were crucial for inducing DLL4 in human DCs. Interestingly, STAT3 directly activated DLL4 transcription and inhibiting STAT3 alone was sufficient to reduce DLL4 in activated PB DCs. Thus, DLL4 is a unique functional molecule of human circulating DCs critical for directing Th1 and Th17 differentiation. These findings identify a pathway for therapeutic intervention for inflammatory disorders in humans, such as graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Allografts", "Blotting, Western", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Dendritic Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Th1 Cells", "Th17 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200231, China;

Adult patients with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma (FL), peripheral T cell lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) undergoing HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation between 1997 and 2009 were included. Two thousand six hundred eleven cases were included. A reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen was used in 62.8% of the transplantations. In a multivariate analysis of myeloablative cases (n = 970), neither acute (aGVHD) nor chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were significantly associated with a lower incidence of relapse/progression in any lymphoma subtype. In contrast, the analysis of RIC cases (n = 1641) showed that cGVHD was associated with a lower incidence of relapse/progression in FL (risk ratio [RR], .51; P = .049) and in MCL (RR, .41; P = .019). Patients with FL or MCL developing both aGVHD and cGVHD had the lowest risk of relapse (RR, .14; P = .007; and RR, .15; P = .0019, respectively). Of interest, the effect of GVHD on decreasing relapse was similar in patients with sensitive disease and chemoresistant disease.

Of 644 consecutive adult transplants performed at our institution between 2001 and 2011, acute cholecystitis occurred in the first year of transplant in 32 patients (5.0%). We conducted 2 retrospective case-control studies of this population to determine risk factors for cholecystitis after HSCT and to evaluate the performance of different methods of imaging to diagnosis cholecystitis in patients undergoing HSCT compared with non-HSCT patients. In the HSCT population, development of cholecystitis was associated with an increased 1-year overall mortality rate (62.5% versus 19.8%, P < .001). The risk of developing cholecystitis was higher in patients who received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.41; P = .009). There was a trend toward more equivocal abdominal ultrasound findings in HSCT recipients with acute cholecystitis compared with nontransplant patients (50.0% versus 30.6%, P = .06).

Early risk assessment could potentially improve outcomes by identifying appropriate patients for preemptive strategies that may ameliorate this high risk. Using a series of landmark analyses, we investigated the predictive value of early (day-30) donor chimerism measurements on disease relapse, graft-versus-host disease, and survival in a cohort of 121 patients allografted with a uniform RIC regimen. Chimerism levels were analyzed as continuous variables. In multivariate analysis, day-30 whole blood chimerism levels were significantly associated with relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = .90, P < .001), relapse-free survival (HR = .89, P < .001), and overall survival (HR = .94, P = .01). Day-30 T cell chimerism levels were also significantly associated with relapse (HR = .97, P = .002), relapse-free survival (HR = .97, P < .001), and overall survival (HR = .99, P = .05). Multivariate models that included T cell chimerism provided a better prediction for these outcomes compared with whole blood chimerism. Day-30 chimerism levels were not associated with acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. We found that high donor chimerism levels were significantly associated with a low lymphocyte count in the recipient before transplant, highlighting the impact of pretransplant lymphopenia on the kinetics of engraftment after RIC HSCT. In summary, low donor chimerism levels are associated with relapse and mortality and can potentially be used as an early predictive and prognostic marker.

Unfortunately, except in patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, responses to DLI have been disappointing. GVL induction is likely to be most effective in the setting of minimal residual disease. Prevention of relapse through the provision of prophylactic DLI to high-risk patients may improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT. We previously reported that ex vivo costimulated T cell infusion of activated DLI (aDLI) as treatment for relapse is safe and has potent GVL effects. We hypothesized that prophylactic aDLI can be given safely and prevent relapse in high-risk patients after allogeneic HSCT. Eighteen patients with acute myeolgenous leukemia (n = 14), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1) underwent allogeneic HSCT after a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and busulfan. Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate with a planned early and rapid taper of tacrolimus. Patients without GVHD, off immune suppression, and in remission received aDLI at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10(7) CD3(+) cells/kg (aDLI 1) at day +120, followed by a second infusion of 1 \u00d7 10(8) CD3 cells/kg (aDLI 2) at day +180. At a median follow-up of 58 months, 5 of the 18 patients (28%) were alive, and 4 patients were in remission. Eleven patients (65%) relapsed, at a median time of 191 days. Twelve of the 18 patients received at least one aDLI, and 6 of these 12 patients also received aDLI 2. Six patients did not receive any aDLI owing to early relapse (n = 2), protocol ineligibility (n = 1), or GVHD (n = 3). Only 2 of the 12 patients who received aDLI 1 developed GVHD. Two out of the 12 patients remain in remission at the time of this report. Disease recurrence was the cause of death in 10 of the 13 patients (77%) who died. Our data indicate that prophylactic ex vivo costimulated CD3/CD28 DLI is safe, feasible, and not associated with significant GVHD.

Of the 210 adult solid organ transplant PTLD patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2012, 9 (4%) had a histological appearance consistent with plasmacytic PTLD.
