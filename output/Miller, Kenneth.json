[{"PMID": "38935792", "Title": "The stabilized supralinear network accounts for the contrast dependence of visual cortical gamma oscillations.", "Abstract": "When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caleb J", "Last Name": "Holt", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth D", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Deptartment of Neuroscience, Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Swartz Program in Theoretical Neuroscience, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Morton B.

We analyzed and theoretically modeled neuronal responses to visual and optogenetic inputs in mouse and monkey V1. In both species, optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons strongly modulated the activity of single neurons yet had weak or no effects on the distribution of firing rates across the population. Thus, the optogenetic inputs reshuffled firing rates across the network. Key statistics of mouse and monkey responses lay on a continuum, with mice/monkeys occupying the low-/high-rate regions, respectively.

Efficient transport requires specific motor-cargo association in the soma, yet the mechanisms regulating this early step remain poorly understood. We found that EBP-1, the C.\u00a0elegans ortholog of the canonical-microtubule-end-binding protein EB1, promotes the specific association between kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104 and dense core vesicles (DCVs) prior to their axonal delivery. Using single-neuron, in\u00a0vivo labeling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargoes, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. EBP-1 calponin homology (CH) domain was required for directing microtubule growth on the Golgi, and mammalian EB1 interacted with KIF1A in an EBH-domain-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments suggest a model in which both kinesin-3 binding and guidance of microtubule growth at the trans Golgi by EBP-1 promote motor-cargo association at sites of DCV biogenesis. In support of this model, tethering either EBP-1 or a kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104-interacting domain from an unrelated protein to the Golgi restored the axonal abundance of DCV proteins in ebp-1 mutants.

However, there is no consensus on the need for or content of such frameworks. This Perspective describes current thought about movement system diagnoses in physical therapy and summarizes the work of the Academy of Geriatrics (APTA Geriatrics) Movement System Diagnosis Task Force (GMS-TF) as it contributes to the movement system diagnosis discussion within the profession. Initially convened to define movement system diagnostic labels unique to older adults, the GMS-TF's developmental process identified the need for a clearer diagnostic framework onto which specific diagnoses will later be added. Although The World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model is a strong foundation for the patient-client management model, the GMS-TF proposes formal incorporation of the Geriatric 5Ms (mobility, medications, memory, multi-complexity, and \"what matters most\") into a movement system framework for older adults. The GMS-TF concurs with the APTA Academy of Neurology Movement System Task Force proposal that observation and analysis of key functional tasks are the foundation of any examination of older adults.

Our planktic foraminifera I/Ca and \u03b415N data, palaeoceanographic proxies sensitive to ODZ extent and intensity, indicate that dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) exceeded 100\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009kg-1 during the MCO. Paired Mg/Ca-derived temperature data suggest that an ODZ developed in response to an increased west-to-east temperature gradient and shoaling of the ETP thermocline.

The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caleb J", "Last Name": "Holt", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Physics, University of Oregon, OR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth D", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Swartz Program in Theoretical Neuroscience, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and Dept. of Neuroscience, College of Physicians and Surgeons and Morton B.

Efficient transport requires specific motor-cargo association in the soma, yet the mechanisms regulating this early step remain poorly understood. We found that EBP-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the canonical microtubule end binding protein EB1, promotes the specific association between kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104 and Dense Core Vesicles (DCVs) prior to their axonal delivery. Using single-neuron, in vivo labelling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargo, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. In addition to its microtubule binding CH domain, mammalian EB1 interacted with mammalian KIF1A in an EBH domain dependent manner, and expression of mammalian EB1 or the EBH domain was sufficient to rescue DCV transport in ebp-1 mutants. Our results suggest a model in which kinesin-3 binding and microtubule binding by EBP-1 cooperate to transiently enrich the motor near sites of DCV biogenesis to promote motor-cargo association. In support of this model, tethering either EBP-1 or a kinesin-3 KIF1A/UNC-104 interacting domain from an unrelated protein to the Golgi restored the axonal abundance of DCV proteins in ebp-1 mutants.

Physical changes occurred quickly. Elevation capital, rates of marsh elevation gain, and soil drainage all increased, while surface inundation, die-off areas, and surface ponding were greatly reduced. Much of the marsh revegetated within a few years, exhibiting aspects of classic successional processes leading to new expansive areas of high marsh species, although low marsh Spartina alterniflora recovered more slowly. Faunal communities, including nekton and birds, were largely unaffected by sediment placement. Overall, sediment placement provided Ninigret Marsh with an estimated 67-320 years of ambient elevation gain, increasing its resilience and likely long-term persistence.

Mangrove forest C burial rates in recent decades were significantly greater than historic decades (1930-1970) at Ca\u00f1no Martin Pe\u00f1a and Pi\u00f1ones. Although MPE and Pi\u00f1ones had similarly low flushing, the landscape settings (clogged canal vs forest reserve) and urbanization (high vs low) were different. Apparently, not only urbanization, but site-specific flushing patterns, landscape setting, and soil fertility affected soil C storage and burial rates. There was no difference in C burial rates between historic and recent decades at the San Jos\u00e9 and La Torrecilla lagoons. Mangrove forests had soil C burial rates ranging from 88 g m-2 y-1 at the San Jos\u00e9 lagoon to 469 g m-2 y-1 at the MPE in recent decades. Watershed anthropogenic CO2 emissions (1.56 million Mg C y-1) far exceeded the annual mangrove forest C storage rates (aboveground biomass plus soils: 17,713 Mg C y-1). A combination of maintaining healthy mangrove forests and reducing anthropogenic emissions might be necessary to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in urban, tropical areas.", "Keywords": ["CO2 emissions", "carbon accumulation", "carbon storage", "mangrove", "peri-urban mangrove", "soil carbon burial", "tropical forest", "urbanization"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cathleen", "Last Name": "Wigand", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meagan", "Last Name": "Eagle", "Affiliation": "U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center, Woods Hole, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin L", "Last Name": "Branoff", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Gulf Ecosystem Measurement and Modeling Division, Gulf Breeze, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Balogh", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology, Alexandria, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rose M", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alana", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Autumn J", "Last Name": "Oczkowski", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Evelyn", "Last Name": "Huertas", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Caribbean Environmental Protection Division, Guaynabo, PR, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Loffredo", "Affiliation": "U.S. EPA, Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth B", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Sciences and The Academy of Natural Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in Forests and Global Change", "PubDate": "2021Jun07"}, {"PMID": "35059638", "Title": "Recent Nitrogen Storage and Accumulation Rates in Mangrove Soils Exceed Historic Rates in the Urbanized San Juan Bay Estuary (Puerto Rico, United States).", "Abstract": "Tropical mangrove forests have been described as \"coastal kidneys,\" promoting sediment deposition and filtering contaminants, including excess nutrients. Coastal areas throughout the world are experiencing increased human activities, resulting in altered geomorphology, hydrology, and nutrient inputs. To effectively manage and sustain coastal mangroves, it is important to understand nitrogen (N) storage and accumulation in systems where human activities are causing rapid changes in N inputs and cycling. We examined N storage and accumulation rates in recent (1970 - 2016) and historic (1930 - 1970) decades in the context of urbanization in the San Juan Bay Estuary (SJBE, Puerto Rico), using mangrove soil cores that were radiometrically dated. Local anthropogenic stressors can alter N storage rates in peri-urban mangrove systems either directly by increasing N soil fertility or indirectly by altering hydrology (e.g., dredging, filling, and canalization). Nitrogen accumulation rates were greater in recent decades than historic decades at Pi\u00f1ones Forest and Martin Pe\u00f1a East. Martin Pe\u00f1a East was characterized by high urbanization, and Pi\u00f1ones, by the least urbanization in the SJBE. The mangrove forest at Martin Pe\u00f1a East fringed a poorly drained canal and often received raw sewage inputs, with N accumulation rates ranging from 17.7 to 37.9 g -2 y-1 in recent decades. The Pi\u00f1ones Forest was isolated and had low flushing, possibly exacerbated by river damming, with N accumulation rates ranging from 18.6 to 24.2 g -2 y-1 in recent decades. Nearly all (96.3%) of the estuary-wide mangrove N (9.4 Mg ha-1) was stored in the soils with 7.1 Mg ha-1 sequestered during 1970-2017 (0-18 cm) and 2.3 Mg ha-1 during 1930-1970 (19-28 cm). Estuary-wide mangrove soil N accumulation rates were over twice as great in recent decades (0.18 \u00b1 0.002 Mg ha-1y-1) than historically (0.08 \u00b1 0.001 Mg ha-1y-1). Nitrogen accumulation rates in SJBE mangrove soils in recent times were twofold larger than the rate of human-consumed food N that is exported as wastewater (0.08 Mg ha-1 y-1), suggesting the potential for mangroves to sequester human-derived N. Conservation and effective management of mangrove forests and their surrounding watersheds in the Anthropocene are important for maintaining water quality in coastal communities throughout tropical regions.", "Keywords": ["anthropogenic stressors", "mangrove forest", "nitrogen accumulation", "nitrogen storage", "peri-urban mangrove", "urbanization", "wastewater"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cathleen", "Last Name": "Wigand", "Affiliation": "Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Autumn J", "Last Name": "Oczkowski", "Affiliation": "Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin L", "Last Name": "Branoff", "Affiliation": "Gulf Ecosystem Measurement and Modeling, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Gulf Breeze, FL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meagan", "Last Name": "Eagle", "Affiliation": "Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center, United States Geological Survey, Woods Hole, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alana", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rose M", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Balogh", "Affiliation": "Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Narragansett, RI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology, Alexandria, VA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Evelyn", "Last Name": "Huertas", "Affiliation": "Caribbean Environmental Protection Division, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Guaynabo, PR, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Loffredo", "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, TN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth B", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biodiversity, Earth & Environmental Science, The Academy of Natural Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in Forests and Global Change", "PubDate": "2021Nov12"}, {"PMID": "34997244", "Title": "Author Correction: A human-specific modifier of cortical connectivity and circuit function.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ewoud R E", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanzhi T", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Mice humanized for SRGAP2C expression in all cortical PNs displayed a shift in the fraction of layer 2/3 PNs activated by sensory stimulation and an enhanced ability to learn a cortex-dependent sensory-discrimination task. Computational modelling revealed that the increased layer 4 to layer 2/3 connectivity induced by SRGAP2C expression explains some of the key changes in sensory coding properties.

We review a wide range of evidence pointing to this cancellation occurring in a regime in which the balance is loose, meaning that the net input remaining after cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size with the factors that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small relative to the canceling factors. This choice of regime has important implications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance, but not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in sensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and yield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as observed across multiple cortical areas.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebral Cortex", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yashar", "Last Name": "Ahmadian", "Affiliation": "Computational and Biological Learning Lab, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion. EPI is then shown to allow precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters and to scale in parameter dimension better than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings in models of primary visual cortex and superior colliculus, which were gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI.

AIHA is associated with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiencies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and pregnancy. AIHA has predictive properties and may be a harbinger of future lymphoproliferative disorders in up to 20% of AIHA cases. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rarely is it seen in Hodgkin disease. In the following report, we describe the presentation of AIHA, ultimately resulting in the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III). From the limited reports and reviews available, it is understood that advanced Hodgkin (stage III or IV) of nodular sclerosis (NS) or mixed cellularity (MC) types portend a stronger affiliation to AIHA. The majority of AIHA-associated Hodgkin lymphoma presents as stage III or IV disease with the hemolysis being the presenting symptom, as in this case. The mainstay of AIHA therapy has been corticosteroids; however, this first-line regimen appears to be less effective when treating AIHA in the setting of HL. The exact mechanism of AIHA related to HL is unclear, and it may be thought to be that tumor cell produced autoantibodies. Other hypotheses include paraneoplastic phenomena or more, perhaps immunity to tumor cells may cross-react with antigens on the red cells.

We used photodetachment of C- to produce a pure beam of atomic C in the ground electronic 3P term, with statistically populated fine-structure levels. The H2+ and D2+ were formed in an electron impact ionization source, with well known vibrational and rotational distributions. The experimental work is complemented by a theoretical study of the CH2+ electronic system in the reactant and product channels, which helps to clarify the possible reaction mechanisms underlying the ICS measurements. Our measurements provide evidence that the reactions are barrierless and exoergic. They also indicate the apparent absence of an intermolecular isotope effect, to within the total experimental uncertainties. Capture models, taking into account either the charge-induced dipole interaction potential or the combined charge-quadrupole and charge-induced dipole interaction potentials, produce reaction cross sections that lie a factor of \u223c4 above the experimental results. Based on our theoretical study, we hypothesize that the reaction is most likely to proceed adiabatically through the 14A' and 14A'' states of CH2+via the reaction C(3P) + H2+(2\u03a3+g) \u2192 CH+(3\u03a0) + H(2S). We also hypothesize that at low collision energies only H2+(v \u2264 2) and D2+(v \u2264 3) contribute to the titular reactions, due to the onset of dissociative charge transfer for higher vibrational v levels. Incorporating these assumptions into the capture models brings them into better agreement with the experimental results. Still, for energies \u2a850.1 eV where capture models are most relevant, the modified charge-induced dipole model yields reaction cross sections with an incorrect energy dependence and lying \u223c10% below the experimental results. The capture cross section obtained from the combined charge-quadrupole and charge-induced dipole model better matches the measured energy dependence but lies \u223c30-50% above the experimental results.

trophic position of predators in food webs using stable isotopes requires establishing a 'baseline'; typically served by bivalves or snails. However, the frequent absence of such organisms in lakes leaves researchers in a difficult situation. Here we test the hypothesis that trophic position (TP) of largemouth bass (LB) in lakes can be estimated from \u03b415N of benthic organic material (BOM) in littoral surficial sediment. \u03b415NLB as a function of \u03b415NBOM was significant across 51 lakes with an R2 of 0.84, supporting our hypothesis. In a subset of six lakes, the mean TPLB did not differ significantly when calculated using baselines of \u03b415N in BOM, mussels (UN), gastropods (SN), or from a stable isotope mixing model. In a subset of 26 lakes, mean TPLB calculated from \u03b415NBOM and \u03b415NUN baselines were not significantly different, but TPLB calculated using \u03b415NBOM was not significantly correlated with TPLB calculated using \u03b415NUN. Although \u03b415NBOM should not be used interchangeably with \u03b415NUN as a baseline for estimating TPLB, \u03b415NBOM can be useful as a separate baseline where estimates of fish TP are needed in all study lakes given that mussels are frequently absent and BOM is always available for collection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James L", "Last Name": "Lake", "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan R", "Last Name": "Serbst", "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Kuhn", "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathan J", "Last Name": "Smucker", "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Systems Exposure Division, 26 Martin Luther King Dr. W., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Rhode Island Division of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Environmental Management, West Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Libby", "Affiliation": "Rhode Island Division of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Environmental Management, West Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Charpentier", "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology, 27 Tarzwell Drive, Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology, 6361 Walker Lane, Suite 300, Alexandria, Virginia, USA."}], "Journal": "Canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.

We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between PI and NPS, with minimal floor and ceiling effects; and that a worse PI score would be associated with a worse general health profile. The sample consisted of 412 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic center. Patients were preoperatively administered measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed to identify significant independent predictors. The mean PI score was 60.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2 and had no floor or ceiling effects, whereas NPS demonstrated a greater percentage of patients scoring at the extremes of the measure. Worse PI scores were associated with older age, higher body mass index (BMI), greater comorbidity, lower income, smoking, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, unemployment, opioid use, lower expectations, and greater American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with other procedures, total knee arthroplasty was associated with worse PI scores and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was associated with better PI scores.

Here we sought to compare the vaginal microbiomes of postmenopausal women who received low dose estrogen therapy to those of premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to do so in conjunction with assessing the alleviation of symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy. In this study vaginal swab samples were obtained from 45 women who were classified as either premenopausal, postmenopausal, or postmenopausal and undergoing HT. The vaginal microbiomes of these women were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial abundances were quantified by qPCR. We found that the vaginal communities from our cohort could be divided into six clusters (A-F) based on differences in the composition and relative abundances of bacterial taxa. Communities in cluster A were dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, and those of cluster B were dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis. Communities in cluster C had high proportions of L. iners, while those in cluster D were more even and included several co-dominant taxa. Communities in clusters E and F were dominated by Bifidobacterium and L. gasseri, respectively. The vaginal communities of most postmenopausal women receiving HT (10/15) were dominated by species of lactobacilli and belonged to clusters A, C, and F (P < 0.001). This sharply contrasts with vaginal communities of postmenopausal women without HT, most of which (10/15) were in cluster D, depleted of lactobacilli, and had about 10-fold fewer total bacteria (P < 0.05). The vaginal communities of women in each study group differed in terms of the dominant bacterial species composition and relative abundance. Those of postmenopausal women receiving HT significantly differed from those of postmenopausal women without HT and were most often dominated by species of Lactobacillus. Noteworthy, HT greatly improved vaginal atrophy scores, decreased vaginal pH, and significantly increased bacterial numbers in comparison to postmenopausal women not receiving HT.", "Keywords": ["hormone replacement therapy", "menopause", "microbial community structure and function", "premenopause", "vaginal atrophy", "vaginal microbiome"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karol", "Last Name": "Gliniewicz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States."}, {"First Name": "G Maria", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Ridenhour", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistical Science, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuli", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "The Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Miranda A", "Last Name": "Farage", "Affiliation": "The Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "The Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Larry J", "Last Name": "Forney", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30612693", "Title": "De Novo Variants in MAPK8IP3 Cause Intellectual Disability with Variable Brain Anomalies.", "Abstract": "Using exome sequencing, we have identified de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 in 13 unrelated individuals presenting with an overlapping phenotype of mild to severe intellectual disability.

Combining genetic, phenotypic, and functional findings, as well as the significant enrichment of de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 within our total cohort of 27,232 individuals who underwent exome sequencing, we implicate de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 as a cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies.", "Keywords": ["MAPK8IP3", "brain anomalies", "de novo", "developmental delay", "intellectual disability", "neurodevelopmental disorder", "polymicrogyria"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adolescent", "Animals", "Brain", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Locomotion", "Lysosomes", "Male", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Exome Sequencing", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Konrad", "Last Name": "Platzer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Hospitals and Clinics, Leipzig 04103, Germany.

elegans.", "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicles (SVs) transmit signals by releasing neurotransmitters from specialized synaptic regions of neurons. In the synaptic region, SVs are tightly clustered around small structures called active zones. The motor KIF1A transports SVs outward through axons until they are captured in the synaptic region. This transport must be guided in the forward direction because it is opposed by the dynein motor, which causes SVs to reverse direction multiple times en route. The core synapse stability (CSS) system contributes to both guided transport and capture of SVs. We identified Sentryn as a CSS protein that contributes to the synaptic localization of SVs in Caenorhabditis elegans Like the CSS proteins SAD Kinase and SYD-2 (Liprin-\u03b1), Sentryn also prevents dynein-dependent accumulation of lysosomes in dendrites in strains lacking JIP3. Genetic analysis showed that Sentryn and SAD Kinase each have at least one nonoverlapping function for the stable accumulation of SVs at synapses that, when combined with their shared functions, enables most of the functions of SYD-2 (Liprin-\u03b1) for capturing SVs. Also like other CSS proteins, Sentryn appears enriched at active zones and contributes to active zone structure, suggesting that it is a novel, conserved active zone protein. Sentryn is recruited to active zones by a process dependent on the active zone-enriched CSS protein SYD-2 (Liprin-\u03b1). Our results define a specialized group of active zone enriched proteins that can affect motorized transport throughout the neuron and that have roles in both guided transport and capture of SVs.", "Keywords": ["Liprin", "SAD kinase", "Sentryn", "axonal transport", "synaptic vesicle"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Axons", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Dendrites", "Dyneins", "Lysosomes", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Protein Transport", "Synaptic Vesicles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stacey L", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Genetic Models of Disease Laboratory, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma 73104."}, {"First Name": "Logan M", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "Genetic Models of Disease Laboratory, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma 73104."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois 60607."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Stec", "Affiliation": "Genetic Models of Disease Laboratory, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma 73104."}, {"First Name": "Janet E", "Last Name": "Richmond", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois 60607."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth G", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Genetic Models of Disease Laboratory, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma 73104 kmiller2686@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2018Nov"}, {"PMID": "30401764", "Title": "Sentryn and SAD Kinase Link the Guided Transport and Capture of Dense Core Vesicles in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "Abstract": "Dense core vesicles (DCVs) can transmit signals by releasing neuropeptides from specialized synaptic regions called active zones. DCVs reach the active zone by motorized transport through a long axon. A reverse motor frequently interrupts progress by taking DCVs in the opposite direction. \"Guided transport\" refers to the mechanism by which outward movements ultimately dominate to bring DCVs to the synaptic region. After guided transport, DCVs alter their interactions with motors and enter a \"captured\" state. The mechanisms of guided transport and capture of DCVs are unknown. Here, we discovered two proteins that contribute to both processes in Caenorhabditis elegans SAD kinase and a novel conserved protein we named Sentryn are the first proteins found to promote DCV capture. By imaging DCVs moving in various regions of single identified neurons in living animals, we found that DCV guided transport and capture are linked through SAD kinase, Sentryn, and Liprin-\u03b1. These proteins act together to regulate DCV motorized transport in a region-specific manner. Between the cell body and the synaptic region, they promote forward transport. In the synaptic region, where all three proteins are highly enriched at active zones, they promote DCV pausing by inhibiting transport in both directions.

It is unclear whether the cognitive benefit can be maximized by increasing the degree of mental challenge during exercise. This randomized clinical trial (RCT), the Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) sought to replicate and extend prior findings of added cognitive benefit from exergaming to those with or at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ACES compares the effects of 6 months of an exer-tour (virtual reality bike rides) with the effects of a more effortful exer-score (pedaling through a videogame to score points). Fourteen community-dwelling older adults meeting screening criteria for MCI (sMCI) were adherent to their assigned exercise for 6 months. The primary outcome was executive function, while secondary outcomes included memory and everyday cognitive function. Exer-tour and exer-score yielded significant moderate effects on executive function (Stroop A/C; d's = 0.51 and 0.47); there was no significant interaction effect. However, after 3 months the exer-tour revealed a significant and moderate effect, while exer-score showed little impact, as did a game-only condition. Both exer-tour and exer-score conditions also resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory. Effects appear to generalize to self-reported everyday cognitive function. Pilot data, including salivary biomarkers and structural MRI, were gathered at baseline and 6 months; exercise dose was associated with increased BDNF as well as increased gray matter volume in the PFC and ACC. Improvement in memory was associated with an increase in the DLPFC. Improved executive function was associated with increased expression of exosomal miRNA-9. Interactive physical and cognitive exercise (both high and low mental challenge) yielded similarly significant cognitive benefit for adherent sMCI exercisers over 6 months.

These reductions were, in large part, the direct result of multiple wastewater treatment facility upgrades to tertiary treatment, a process which employs N removal. Here we document ecosystem response to the N reductions and assess how the distribution of sewage N in Narragansett Bay has changed from before, during, and shortly after the upgrades. While others have observed clear responses when data were considered annually, our seasonal and regional comparisons of pre- and post-tertiary treatment dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations and Secchi depth data, from bay-wide surveys conducted periodically from the early 1970s through 2016, resulted in only a few subtle differences. Thus we sought to use stable isotope data to assess how sewage N is incorporated into the ecology of the Bay and how its distribution may have changed after the upgrades. The nitrogen (\u03b415N) and carbon (\u03b413C) stable isotope measurements of particulate matter served as a proxy for phytoplankton, while macroalgae served as short-term integrators of water column bio-available N, and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) as integrators of water column production. In contrast to other estuarine stable isotope studies that have observed an increased influence of isotopically lower marine N when sewage N is reduced, the opposite has occurred in Narragansett Bay. The tertiary treatment upgrades have increased the effluent \u03b415N values by at least 2\u2030. The plants and animals throughout Narragansett Bay have similarly increased by 1-2\u2030, on average. In contrast, the \u03b413C values measured in particulate matter and hard clams have declined by about the same amount. The \u03b415N results indicated that, even after the N-reductions, sewage N still plays an important role in supporting primary and secondary production throughout the Bay. However, the \u03b413C suggest that overall net production in Narragansett Bay has decreased. In the five years after the major wastewater treatment facilities came on-line for nutrient removal, oligotrophication has begun but sewage remains the dominant source of N to Narragansett Bay.", "Keywords": ["ecosystem response", "eutrophication", "oligotrophication", "sewage treatment plant", "stable isotope", "tertiary treatment", "wastewater treatment facility", "\u03b415N"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Autumn", "Last Name": "Oczkowski", "Affiliation": "US EPA, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Dr. Narragansett, RI 02882."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Narragansett Bay Estuary Program - NEIWPCC 235 Promenade St. Suite 310 Providence, RI 02908."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Humboldt State University, Geology, 1 Harpst St. Arcata, CA 95521."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "CSRA LLC, 6361 Walker Lane Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22310."}, {"First Name": "Alana", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "US EPA, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Dr. Narragansett, RI 02882."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Cobb", "Affiliation": "US EPA, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Dr. Narragansett, RI 02882."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Krumholz", "Affiliation": "McLaughlin Research Corporation, 132 Johnnycake Hill Rd., Middletown, RI 02842."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Pimenta", "Affiliation": "US EPA, Atlantic Ecology Division, 27 Tarzwell Dr. Narragansett, RI 02882."}, {"First Name": "Leanna", "Last Name": "Heffner", "Affiliation": "Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 1011 E.

Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. Although the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Visual neurons are selective for specific stimulus features in a region of visual space known as the receptive field, but can be modulated by stimuli outside of the receptive field. The SSN model has been proposed to account for these and other modulatory influences, and tested in V1. As this model is not specific to any particular stimulus feature or brain region, we wondered whether similar modulatory influences might be observed for other stimulus dimensions and other regions. We tested for specific patterns of modulatory influences in the domain of motion direction, using electrophysiological recordings from MT. Our data confirm the predictions of the SSN in MT, suggesting that the SSN computations might be a generic feature of sensory cortex.", "Keywords": ["GABA", "Inhibition", "MT", "Stabilized Supralinear Network", "Surround suppression", "Vision"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Macaca mulatta", "Models, Neurological", "Motion Perception", "Photic Stimulation", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liu D", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 2B4, Canada, and."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth D", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Swartz Program in Theoretical Neuroscience, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Christopher C", "Last Name": "Pack", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 2B4, Canada, and christopher.pack@mcgill.ca."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jan24"}, {"PMID": "29163867", "Title": "Strengthening mental health care systems for Syrian refugees in Europe and the Middle East: integrating scalable psychological interventions in eight countries.", "Abstract": "The crisis in Syria has resulted in vast numbers of refugees seeking asylum in Syria's neighbouring countries as well as in Europe.

However, when activity is suppressed by stimuli outside the RF, slow LIP dynamics markedly deviate from a single dimension. The conflicting results can be reconciled if two LIP local networks, each underlying an RF location and dominated by a single multi-neuronal activity pattern, are suppressively coupled to each other.

The current work was focused on identification of a primary sequence in mAb-1 responsible for the binding and consequent co-purification of trace levels of CHO cathepsin D. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to detect binding between immobilized CHO cathepsin D and a panel of mAbs. Out of 13 mAbs tested, only mAb-1 and mAb-6 bound to cathepsin D. An LYY motif in the HC CDR2 was common, yet unique, to only these two mAbs. Mutation of LYY to AAA eliminated binding of mAb-1 to cathepsin D providing confirmation that this sequence motif was involved in the binding to CHO cathepsin D. Interestingly, the binding between mAb-1 and cathepsin D was weaker than that of mAb-6, which may be related to the fact that two aspartic acid residues near the LYY motif in mAb-1 are replaced with neutral serine residues in mAb-6. \u00a9 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The available data regarding the mechanism by which each therapy causes vascular complication are summarized.

Glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1/VGLUT2/GLS) in the ICG that have axons to the ventricles were identified by retrograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected in the ventricular wall. Co-labeling of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GLS with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was used to evaluate the relationship between post-ganglionic autonomic neurons and glutamatergic neurons.

A JIP3 mutant suppressor screen in C. elegans revealed that JIP3 promotes the clearance of organelles from axons by blocking the action of the CSS system (Cdk5, SAD Kinase, SYD-2/Liprin). A synthesis of results in vertebrates with the new findings suggests that JIP3 blocks the CSS system from disrupting the connection between dynein and organelles. Most components of the CSS system are enriched at presynaptic active zones where they normally contribute to maintaining optimal levels of captured synaptic and dense core vesicles, in part by inhibiting dynein transport.

The deposition of H3K4me3 on developmental promoters in late-G1 establishes a permissive chromatin architecture that enables signaling cues to promote differentiation from the G1 phase.

Specifically, by utilizing dimeric CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases, RFNs (commercially known as the NextGEN\u2122 CRISPR), in combination with an excision-only piggyBac\u2122 transposase, we demonstrate how to generate a point mutation of threonine-542, a predicted site to prevent MLL2 activation. This gene editing method enables the use of both positive and negative selection, and allows for subsequent removal of the donor cassette without leaving behind any unwanted DNA sequences or modifications. This seamless \"donor-excision\" approach provides clear advantages over using single stranded oligo-deoxynucleotides (ssODN) as donors to create point mutations, as the use of ssODN necessitate additional mutations in the donor PAM sequence, along with extensive cloning efforts. The method described here therefore provides the highest targeting efficiency with the lowest \"off-target\" mutation rates possible, while removing the labor-intensive efforts associated with screening thousands of clones. In sum, this chapter describes how seamless gene editing may be utilized to examine stem cell heterogeneity of epigenetic marks, but is also widely applicable for performing precise genetic manipulations in numerous other cell types.", "Keywords": ["CDK2", "CRISPR", "Heterogeneity", "MLL2", "Pluripotent stem cells", "TALEN", "piggyBac"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Chromatin", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Editing", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Human Embryonic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amar M", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., 535 W.

We assessed GLS expression after unilateral hind paw inflammation by measuring GLS immunoreactivity (ir) with quantitative image analysis of L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after one, two, four, and eight days of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) compared to saline injected controls. No significant elevation in GLS-ir occurred in the DRG ipsilateral to the inflamed hind paw after one or two days of AIA. After four days AIA, GLS-ir was elevated significantly in all sizes of DRG neurons. After eight days AIA, GLS-ir remained elevated in small (<400 \u00b5m\u00b2), presumably nociceptive neurons.

However, little is known about UNC-16's organelle transport regulatory function, which is distinct from its Kinesin-1 adaptor function. We used an unc-16 suppressor screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to discover that UNC-16 acts through CDK-5 (Cdk5) and two conserved synapse assembly proteins: SAD-1 (SAD-A Kinase), and SYD-2 (Liprin-\u03b1). Genetic analysis of all combinations of double and triple mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds showed that the three proteins (CDK-5, SAD-1, and SYD-2) are all part of the same organelle transport regulatory system, which we named the CSS system based on its founder proteins. Further genetic analysis revealed roles for SYD-1 (another synapse assembly protein) and STRAD\u03b1 (a SAD-1-interacting protein) in the CSS system. In an unc-16(-) background, loss of the CSS system improved the sluggish locomotion of unc-16 mutants, inhibited axonal lysosome accumulation, and led to the dynein-dependent accumulation of lysosomes in dendrites. Time-lapse imaging of lysosomes in CSS system mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds revealed active transport defects consistent with the steady-state distributions of lysosomes. UNC-16 also uses the CSS system to regulate the distribution of early endosomes in neurons and, to a lesser extent, Golgi.

The kinesin motor KIF1A transports SVs from somas to stable SV clusters at synapses, while dynein moves them in the opposite direction.

We addressed these questions by isolating a rare temperature-sensitive allele of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-104 (KIF1A) that allowed us to manipulate SV levels in axons and dendrites. Growth at 20\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 resulted in locomotion rates that were \u223c3 and 50% of wild type, respectively, with similar effects on axonal SV levels. Corresponding with the loss of SVs from axons, mutants grown at 14\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 showed a 10- and 24-fold dynein-dependent accumulation of SVs in their dendrites. Mutants grown at 14\u00b0 and switched to 25\u00b0 showed an abrupt irreversible 50% decrease in locomotion and a 50% loss of SVs from the synaptic region 12-hr post-shift, with no further decreases at later time points, suggesting that the remaining clustered SVs are stable and resistant to retrograde removal by dynein. The data further showed that the synapse-assembly proteins SYD-1, SYD-2, and SAD-1 protected SV clusters from degradation by motor proteins.

Furthermore, the stochasticity may not be independent and identically distributed (iid) across elements of the connectivity matrix. More generally, the problem of understanding the behavior of stochastic matrices with nontrivial mean structure and correlations arises in many settings. We address this by characterizing large random N\u00d7N matrices of the form A=M+LJR, where M,L, and R are arbitrary deterministic matrices and J is a random matrix of zero-mean iid elements. M can be non-normal, and L and R allow correlations that have separable dependence on row and column indices. We first provide a general formula for the eigenvalue density of A. For A non-normal, the eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by A, so we also provide general formulas for the transient evolution of the magnitude of activity and frequency power spectrum in an N-dimensional linear dynamical system with a coupling matrix given by A. These quantities can also be thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We derive these formulas and work them out analytically for some examples of M,L, and R motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the persistence as N\u2192\u221e of a finite number of randomly distributed outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of A, as previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane \u03a9 where there are nonzero singular values of L(-1)(z1-M)R(-1) (for z\u2208\u03a9) that vanish as N\u2192\u221e.

The primary source of neurotransmitter, glutamate, is provided from its synthetic enzyme, glutaminase (GLS). Neurotransmitter glutamate is packaged into synaptic vesicles in nociceptive neurons by the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Little is known, however, what effect a surgical incision has on GLS and VGluT2 in primary afferent neurons. In this study, an aseptic, midline incision in the proximal one-third of the rat-tail was examined to determine whether sacral dorsal root ganglia innervate the area of surgical incision, utilizing the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold\u2122. Subsequently, the amount of VGluT2 and GLS immunoreactivity (IR) in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was evaluated using immunofluorescence with image analysis and Western immunoblotting with density analysis. GLS messenger RNA (mRNA) changes were evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT2-PCR). Our findings revealed that sacral-1 (S1) DRG neurons innervate the area of surgical incision. Both GLS and VGluT2-ir are elevated post-surgical incision in S1 DRG neurons for up to 72 hours, while GLS mRNA levels rapidly decreased post-incision and remain depressed for at least 96 hours. Following a surgical incision of the tail, sacral DRGs rapidly deplete their available supply of GLS mRNA and alter their production of the synthetic enzyme, GLS and the vesicular transporter, VGluT2.

It inhibits several glutamine-dependent enzyme pathways. Of particular note is its inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial enzyme, glutaminase (GLS), the primary producer of neuronal glutamate. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter released by primary sensory peripheral nerve terminals and spinal synaptic terminals during pain signaling. Previous work using the tail incision and inflammatory models of pain has demonstrated that a single application of the glutaminase inhibitor, DON, into a surgical incision or the paw of arthritic animals results in pain relief. Even though this compound shows promise as a therapeutic agent, limited data exist regarding its dermal toxicity. As a first approach, we evaluated the effect of several concentrations of DON, on the viability, mitochondrial oxidative capacity and proliferation of rat skin fibroblasts, and then examined the effect of DON after incubation with human liver microsomes on proliferation. Finally, we evaluated DON treated rat skin (tail and hind paw) for cellular necrosis, inflammation and mitotic bodies. No significant effects (p > 0.05) of DON were noted on apoptosis, necrosis, and mitochondrial activity in experiments with cultured rat skin fibroblasts. Flow cytometry revealed the absence of apoptosis in cells treated at the IC50 of 232.5 \u03bcM. Enhanced toxicity post-exposure to human microsomes was not observed when compared to DON alone. The H&E staining of the rat skin revealed no obvious pathology in the DON treatment group (10 mM). DON has no/minimal cellular toxicity in vitro on dermal fibroblasts at concentrations that effectively provide analgesia. The local application of concentrations greater than the in vitro IC50 for DON revealed no in vivo skin toxicity.

The suppression of the contribution of the untuned input component to firing rate responses is key to establishing orientation selectivity and its invariance with stimulus contrast. It has been argued that synaptic depression of LGN inputs could contribute to the selective suppression of the untuned component and thus contribute to the tuning observed in simple cells. We examine this using a model fit to the depression observed at thalamocortical synapses in-vivo, and compare this to an earlier model fit based on in-vitro observations. We examine the tuning of both the conductance and the firing rate induced in simple cells by the net LGN input. We find that depression causes minimal suppression of the untuned component. The primary effect of depression is to cause the contrast response curve to saturate at lower contrasts without differentially affecting the tuned vs. untuned components.

When deprived of their source of NGF by axotomy, medial septal neuronal cell bodies atrophy and lose their cholinergic markers. This is similar to what is observed in the basal forebrain during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, medial septal neurons were axotomized in female rats by way of a fimbria/fornix lesion. For fourteen days following axotomy, varying NGF doses (1 - 250 \u03bcg/ml) were administered to the lateral cerebral ventricle with either mini-osmotic infusion or daily injection. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons was evaluated with choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry. Within the mini-osmotic pumps, NGF activity diminished greatly during the first five days of implantation, but increased dramatically in the CSF after five days of infusion. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons to NGF was dose dependent and the ED50 for NGF injection was determined to be 14.08 \u03bcg/ml compared to 27.60 \u03bcg/ml for NGF infusion. Intermittent injections at varying intervals were evaluated with 30 \u03bcg/ml NGF over a fourteen-day time period (2, 3, 6, or 12 injections). No differences occurred in the number of choline acetyltransferase neurons from rats that received weekly injections to those that received daily injections of NGF. NGF administration has been suggested as a therapy for AD.

We found that Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons send most of their DCVs to axons, leaving very few in the cell somas. How neurons maintain this skewed distribution and the extent to which it can be altered to control DCV numbers in axons or to drive release from somas for different behavioral impacts is unknown. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified loss-of-function mutations in UNC-43 (CaM kinase II) that reduce axonal DCV levels by \u223c90% and cell soma/dendrite DCV levels by \u223c80%, leaving small synaptic vesicles largely unaffected. Blocking regulated secretion in unc-43 mutants restored near wild-type axonal levels of DCVs. Time-lapse video microscopy showed no role for CaM kinase II in the transport of DCVs from cell somas to axons. In vivo secretion assays revealed that much of the missing neuropeptide in unc-43 mutants is secreted via a regulated secretory pathway requiring UNC-31 (CAPS) and UNC-18 (nSec1). DCV cargo levels in unc-43 mutants are similarly low in cell somas and the axon initial segment, indicating that the secretion occurs prior to axonal transport. Genetic pathway analysis suggests that abnormal neuropeptide function contributes to the sluggish basal locomotion rate of unc-43 mutants.

By measuring the Doppler shifts of these lines (expected relative change in wavelength on the order of 10\u207b\u2078), we are able to determine the thermospheric winds. Because the expected wavelength changes due to the Doppler shift are so small, understanding, monitoring, and accounting for thermal effects is expected to be important. Previously, the thermal behavior of a temperature-compensated monolithic DASH interferometer was found to have a higher thermal sensitivity than predicted by a simple model [Opt. Express 18, 26430, 2010]. A follow-up study [Opt. Express 20, 9535, 2012] suggested that this is due to thermal distortion of the interferometer, which consists of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. In this work, we characterize the thermal drift of a nonmonolithic Echelle DASH interferometer and discuss the implications of these results on the use of only a single wavelength source during calibration. Furthermore, we perform a finite element analysis of the earlier monolithic interferometer in order to determine how distortion would affect the thermal sensitivity of that device. Incorporating that data into the model, we find good agreement between the modified model and the measured thermal sensitivities.

These persistent symptoms are related to survivors' cancer diagnosis and the treatment they received, as well as age and other comorbidities. Health-related quality of life generally is stable for many years, although some cancer survivors experience a significant drop in health-related quality of life years after treatment, although the etiology is not clear yet.

This supralinear input-output function leads to supralinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs for weak inputs. We show that for stronger inputs, which would drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the balanced network, which yields only linear behavior. We more exhaustively analyze the two-dimensional case of one excitatory and one inhibitory population. We show that in this case, dynamic stabilization will occur whenever the determinant of the weight matrix is positive and the inhibitory time constant is sufficiently small, and analyze the conditions for supersaturation, or decrease of firing rates with increasing stimulus contrast (which represents increasing input firing rates). In work to be presented elsewhere, we have found that this transition from supralinear to sublinear summation can explain a wide variety of nonlinearities in cerebral cortical processing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Feedback, Physiological", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Net", "Neural Inhibition", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Neurons", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yashar", "Last Name": "Ahmadian", "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. ya2005@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Daniel B", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth D", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neural computation", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23633144", "Title": "An organelle gatekeeper function for Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-16 (JIP3) at the axon initial segment.", "Abstract": "Neurons must cope with extreme membrane trafficking demands to produce axons with organelle compositions that differ dramatically from those of the cell soma and dendrites; however, the mechanism by which they accomplish this is not understood. Here we use electron microscopy and quantitative imaging of tagged organelles to show that Caenorhabditis elegans axons lacking UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) accumulate Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes at levels up to 10-fold higher than wild type, while ER membranes are largely unaffected. Time lapse microscopy of tagged lysosomes in living animals and an analysis of lysosome distributions in various regions of unc-16 mutant axons revealed that UNC-16 inhibits organelles from escaping the axon initial segment (AIS) and moving to the distal synaptic part of the axon. Immunostaining of native UNC-16 in C. elegans neurons revealed a localized concentration of UNC-16 at the initial segment, although UNC-16 is also sparsely distributed in distal regions of axons, including the synaptic region. Organelles that escape the AIS in unc-16 mutants show bidirectional active transport within the axon commissure that occasionally deposits them in the synaptic region, where their mobility decreases and they accumulate. These results argue against the long-standing, untested hypothesis that JIP3/Sunday Driver promotes anterograde organelle transport in axons and instead suggest an organelle gatekeeper model in which UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) selectively inhibits the escape of Golgi and endosomal organelles from the AIS. This is the first evidence for an organelle gatekeeper function at the AIS, which could provide a regulatory node for controlling axon organelle composition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Axons", "Biological Transport, Active", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Dyneins", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Endosomes", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go", "Golgi Apparatus", "Intracellular Membranes", "Lysosomes", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Models, Biological", "Organelles", "Suppression, Genetic", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stacey L", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Genetic Models of Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Szi-chieh", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Hoover", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barret C", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet E", "Last Name": "Richmond", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth G", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genetics", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23567207", "Title": "Monovalent IgG4 molecules: immunoglobulin Fc mutations that result in a monomeric structure.", "Abstract": "Antibodies have become the fastest growing class of biological therapeutics, in part due to their exquisite specificity and ability to modulate protein-protein interactions with a high biological potency. The relatively large size and bivalency of antibodies, however, limits their use as therapeutics in certain circumstances. Antibody fragments, such as single-chain variable fragments and antigen binding-fragments, have emerged as viable alternatives, but without further modifications these monovalent formats have reduced terminal serum half-lives because of their small size and lack of an Fc domain, which is required for FcRn-mediated recycling. Using rational engineering of the IgG4 Fc domain to disrupt key interactions at the CH3-CH3 interface, we identified a number of point mutations that abolish Fc dimerization and created half-antibodies, a novel monovalent antibody format that retains a monomeric Fc domain. Introduction of these mutations into an IgG1 framework also led to the creation of half-antibodies. These half-antibodies were shown to be soluble, thermodynamically stable and monomeric, characteristics that are favorable for use as therapeutic proteins. Despite significantly reduced FcRn binding in vitro, which suggests that avidity gains in a dimeric Fc are critical to optimal FcRn binding, this format demonstrated an increased terminal serum half-life compared with that expected for most alternative antibody fragments.", "Keywords": ["Antibody engineering", "FcRn", "half-antibody", "half-life extension", "monomeric Fc"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Half-Life", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Engineering", "Protein Stability", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Receptors, Fc", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Single-Chain Antibodies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian C", "Last Name": "Wilkinson", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Susan B", "Last Name": "Fowler", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Leeann", "Last Name": "Machiesky", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Hayes", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "Morshed", "Last Name": "Adib", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Her", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "M Jack", "Last Name": "Borrok", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Tsui", "Affiliation": "MedImmune LLC.; Departments of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and Analytical Biochemistry; Gaithersburg, MD USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Burrell", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dominic J", "Last Name": "Corkill", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Susanne", "Last Name": "Witt", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Lowe", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Carl I", "Last Name": "Webster", "Affiliation": "MedImmune Ltd.; Department of Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering; Cambridge, UK."}], "Journal": "mAbs", "PubDate": "2013May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "23219702", "Title": "Antiviral activity of (+)-sattabacin against varicella zoster.", "Abstract": "The first report of the antiviral activity of (+)-sattabacin against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is described.
