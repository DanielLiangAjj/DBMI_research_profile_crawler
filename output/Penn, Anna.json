function is essential to fetal brain development. Placental hormones include neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (ALLO), a regulator of neurodevelopmental processes via positive allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor (GABAA-R). Using a mouse model (plKO) in which the gene encoding the ALLO synthesis enzyme is specifically deleted in trophoblasts, we previously showed that placental ALLO insufficiency alters cerebellar white matter development and leads to male-specific autistic-like behavior. We now demonstrate that the lack of placental ALLO causes female-predominant alterations of cortical development and function. Placental ALLO insufficiency disrupts cell proliferation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in a sex-linked manner. Early changes are seen in plKO embryos of both sexes, but persist primarily in female offspring after birth. Adolescent plKO females show significant reduction in pyramidal neuron density, as well as somatosensory behavioral deficits as compared with plKO males and control littermates. Assessment of layer-specific markers in human postmortem cortices suggests that preterm infants may also have female-biased abnormalities in cortical layer specification as compared with term infants. This study establishes a novel and fundamental link between placental function and sex-linked long-term neurological outcomes, emphasizing the importance of the growing field of neuroplacentology.",

GABAergic and glutamatergic systems during frontal lobe development have been hypothesized to play a key role in neurodevelopmental disorders seen in children born very preterm or at/with low birth weight, but the associated cellular changes have not yet been identified. Here we studied the molecular development of the GABAergic system specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region that has been implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The maturation state of the GABAergic system in this region was assessed in human post-mortem brain samples, from term infants ranging in age from 0 to 8 months (n = 17 male, 9 female). Gene expression was measured for 47 GABAergic genes and used to calculate a maturation index. This maturation index was significantly more dynamic in male than female infants. To evaluate the impact of premature birth on the GABAergic system development, samples from 1-month-old term (n = 9 male, 4 female) and 1-month corrected-age very preterm (n = 8 male, 6 female) infants, were compared using the same gene list and methodology. The maturation index for the GABAergic system was significantly lower (-50%, p < 0.05) in male preterm infants, with major alterations in genes linked to GABAergic function in astrocytes, suggesting astrocytic GABAergic developmental changes as a new cellular mechanism underlying preterm brain injury.", "Keywords": ["GABA", "astrocyte", "maturation", "neurodevelopment", "prefrontal cortex",

All newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the demographic parameters or placental histopathological characteristics were associated with disease severity. The fetal-maternal transfer ratio for IgG against the N or S viral proteins was commonly less than one, as recently reported.

and neonatal intensive care units.", "Abstract": "During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, infection prevention and control (IP&C) for women in labor and mothers and newborns during delivery and receiving post-partum care was quite challenging for staff, patients, and support persons due to a relative lack of evidence-based practices, high rates of community transmission, and shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). We present our IP&C policies and procedures for the obstetrical population developed from mid-March to mid-May 2020 when New York City served as the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. For patients, we describe screening for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2, and clearing patients from COVID-19 precautions. For staff, we address self-monitoring for symptoms, PPE in different clinical scenarios, and reducing staff exposures to SARS-CoV-2. For visitors/support persons, we address limiting them in labor and delivery, the postpartum units, and the NICU to promote staff and patient safety. We describe management of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and their newborns in both the well-baby nursery and in the neonatal ICU. Notably, in the well-baby nursery we do not separate SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers from their newborns, but emphasize maternal mask use and social distancing by placing newborns in isolates and asking mothers to remain 6 feet away unless feeding or changing their newborn. We also encourage direct breastfeeding and do not advocate early bathing. Newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers are considered persons under investigation (PUIs) until 14 days of life, the duration of the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2. We share two models of community-based care for PUI neonates. Finally, we provide our strategies for enhancing communication and education during the early months of the pandemic.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Delivery Rooms", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Intensive Care Units, Neonatal", "Masks", "Mass Screening", "Nurseries, Hospital", "Organizational Policy", "Personal Protective Equipment", "Physical Distancing", "SARS-CoV-2", "Visitors to Patients"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Saiman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States; Department of Infection Prevention & Control, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States.

A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin (SST) and calbindin (CLB) interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA.

Cranial ultrasound (CUS) is a noninvasive imaging tool that has been used widely to diagnose and monitor neonates with IVH. In our previous work, we showed the potential of quantitative morphological analysis of lateral ventricles from early CUS to predict the PHH outcome in neonates with IVH. In this paper, we first present a new automatic method for ventricle segmentation in 2D CUS images. We detect the brain bounding box and brain mid-line to estimate the anatomical positions of ventricles and correct the brain rotation. The ventricles are segmented using a combination of fuzzy c-means, phase congruency, and active contour algorithms. Finally, we compare this fully automated approach with our previous work for the prediction of the outcome of PHH on a set of 2D CUS images taken from 60 premature neonates with different IVH grades. Experimental results showed that our method could segment ventricles with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 \u00b1 0.12. In addition, our fully automated method could predict the outcome of PHH based on the extracted ventricle regions with similar accuracy to our previous semi-automated approach (83% vs. 84%, respectively, p-value = 0.8). This method has the potential to standardize the evaluation of CUS images and can be a helpful clinical tool for early monitoring and treatment of IVH and PHH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Echoencephalography", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Infant, Premature"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pooneh R", "Last Name": "Tabrizi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rawad", "Last Name": "Obeid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan J", "Last Name": "Cerrolaza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Penn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Awais", "Last Name": "Mansoor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marius George", "Last Name": "Linguraru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

To further explore associations between the clinical categories of preterm birth and placental histology, 109 infants with gestational age <34 weeks and birth weight <2000\u2009g were selected and, based on electronic records, were classified into preterm birth categories of preterm labor, prelabor premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, indicated preterm birth for maternal factors (other than preeclampsia), indicated preterm birth for fetal factors, and the clinical diagnosis of abruption. Corresponding placentas were analyzed for gross and microscopic variables, with findings grouped into categories of amniotic fluid infection, lymphocytic inflammation, maternal vascular malperfusion, and fetal vascular malperfusion. Placental features of maternal vascular malperfusion were pervasive in all preterm birth categories and were commonly associated with amniotic fluid infection and lymphocytic inflammation. Features of maternal vascular malperfusion were significantly associated with preterm birth due to preeclampsia, and amniotic fluid infection was highly associated with prelabor preterm rupture of membranes. Findings of lymphocytic inflammation were significantly increased in cases of abruption. Laminar decidual necrosis was present in all cases of abruption. Placentas from multiple gestations had significantly less histologic findings compared to singletons. Given that 75% of placentas demonstrated at least 1 feature of maternal vascular malperfusion despite different clinical presentations, seemingly different pathologies such as ascending amniotic fluid infection or lymphocytic inflammation may be mechanistically related to processes established early in pregnancy. The concept of \"uterine ischemia\" may be too simplistic to account for all of the changes attributed to maternal vascular malperfusion in the preterm placenta.", "Keywords": ["amniotic fluid infection", "chronic inflammation", "placenta histology", "preeclampsia", "preterm birth"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Obstetric Labor, Premature", "Placenta", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Premature Birth", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karen M", "Last Name": "Chisholm", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "Norton", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Anna A", "Last Name": "Penn", "Affiliation": "3 Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Heerema-McKenney", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}], "Journal": "Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society", "PubDate": "2018Nov-Dec"}, {"PMID": "29255191", "Title": "The use of clinical examination and cranial ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation in extremely premature infants.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to describe clinical and ultrasound changes in a cohort of premature newborns with post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation (PHVD), and to correlate these changes with outcome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Birth Weight", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Cerebral Ventriculography", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Head", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature, Diseases", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Ultrasonography", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rawad", "Last Name": "Obeid", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Nemours/ A.

Cranial ultrasound (CUS) is used for monitoring of premature neonates during the first weeks after birth to identify IVH and follow the progression to PHH. However, the lack of a standardized method for CUS evaluation has led to significant variability in decision making regarding treatment. We propose a quantitative imaging tool for the evaluation of PHH on CUS for premature neonates based on morphological features of the cerebral ventricles. We retrospectively studied 64 extremely premature neonates born less than 29 weeks gestational age, less than 1,500 grams weight at birth, admitted to our center within two weeks of life, and diagnosed with different grades of IVH. We extracted morphological features of the lateral ventricles from CUS imaging using image analysis techniques to compare neonates who needed a temporizing intervention to treat PHH to the ones who did not. From the original set of features, an optimal ranking was obtained based on linear support vector machine. A subset of features was subsequently selected that maximizes the overall accuracy level. Regarding whether or not there was a need for temporizing intervention, we predicted the outcome of PHH with an improved accuracy level of 84%, compared to the 76% rate obtained by linear manual measurement. The proposed imaging tool allowed us to establish a quantitative method for PHH evaluation on CUS in extremely premature neonates with IVH. Further studies will help standardize the evaluation of CUS in those neonates to institute treatments earlier and improve outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Echoencephalography", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Infant, Premature, Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pooneh R", "Last Name": "Tabrizi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rawad", "Last Name": "Obeid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Awais", "Last Name": "Mansoor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Ensel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan J", "Last Name": "Cerrolaza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Penn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marius George", "Last Name": "Linguraru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.
