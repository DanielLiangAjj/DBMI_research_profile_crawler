We found that human pluripotent stem cells with homozygous or heterozygous R138X mutation and the null (KO) mutation have normal efficiency of differentiation towards insulin-producing cells, but these cells show diffuse granules that lack crystalline zinc-containing insulin granules. Insulin secretion is not compromised in vitro by KO or R138X mutations in human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells (sc-beta cells).

Several genetic diseases are caused by mutations in key DNA replication genes; however, it remains unclear whether these genes influence the normal program of DNA replication timing. Similarly, the factors that regulate DNA replication dynamics are poorly understood. To systematically identify trans-acting modulators of replication timing, we profiled replication in 184 cell lines from three cell types, encompassing 60 different gene knockouts or genetic diseases. Through a rigorous approach that considers the background variability of replication timing, we concluded that most samples displayed normal replication timing. However, mutations in two genes showed consistently abnormal replication timing. The first gene was RIF1, a known modulator of replication timing. The second was MCM10, a highly conserved member of the pre-replication complex. Cells from a single patient carrying MCM10 mutations demonstrated replication timing variability comprising 46% of the genome and at different locations than RIF1 knockouts. Replication timing alterations in the mutated MCM10 cells were predominantly comprised of replication delays and initiation site gains and losses.

Key cell-cell interactions involved in the pathogenesis of T1D are activation of autoreactive T cells by dendritic cells (DC), migration of T cells across endothelial cells (EC) lining capillary walls into the islets of Langerhans, interaction of T cells with macrophages in the islets, and killing of \u03b2-cells by autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Overall, pathogenic cell-cell interactions are likely regulated by the individual's collection of genetic T1D-risk variants. To accurately model the role of genetics, it is essential to build systems to interrogate single candidate genes in isolation during the interactions of cells that are essential for disease development. However, obtaining single-donor matched cells relevant to T1D is a challenge. Sourcing these genetic variants from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) avoids this limitation. Herein, we have differentiated iPSC from one donor into DC, macrophages, EC, and \u03b2-cells. Additionally, we also engineered T cell avatars from the same donor to provide an in vitro platform to study genetic influences on these critical cellular interactions. This proof of concept demonstrates the ability to derive an isogenic system from a single donor to study these relevant cell-cell interactions. Our system constitutes an interdisciplinary approach with a controlled environment that provides a proof-of-concept for future studies to determine the role of disease alleles (e.g. IFIH1, PTPN22, SH2B3, TYK2) in regulating cell-cell interactions and cell-specific contributions to the pathogenesis of T1D.", "Keywords": ["autoimmunity", "beta cells", "human", "immunity", "induced pluripotent

Here, we review the significant scientific contributions to the field of human heritable genome editing, the unique ethical challenges that cannot be overlooked, and the hurdles that must be overcome prior to translating these technologies into clinical practice.", "Keywords": ["germline genome editing", "heritable disease", "mutations", "reproduction", "reproductive medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "DNA Breaks", "Gene Editing", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jenna", "Last Name": "Turocy", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eli Y", "Last Name": "Adashi", "Affiliation": "Professor of Medical Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA.

To investigate the molecular basis of obesity in human BBS, we developed a cellular model of BBS using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) hypothalamic arcuate-like neurons. BBS mutations BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 did not affect neuronal differentiation efficiency but caused morphological defects, including impaired neurite outgrowth and longer primary cilia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of BBS1M390R hypothalamic neurons identified several downregulated pathways, including insulin and cAMP signaling and axon guidance. Additional studies demonstrated that BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 mutations impaired insulin signaling in both human fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons. Overexpression of intact BBS10 fully restored insulin signaling by restoring insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in BBS10C91fsX95 neurons. Moreover, mutations in BBS1 and BBS10 impaired leptin-mediated p-STAT3 activation in iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons. Correction of the BBS mutation by CRISPR rescued leptin signaling. POMC expression and neuropeptide production were decreased in BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons.

We found that the combination of G1 arrest with a compromised ability to complete DNA replication promoted the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells toward insulin-producing cells and could substitute for endocrine differentiation factors. Reduced replication fork speed during differentiation improved the stability of insulin expression, and the resulting cells protected mice from diabetes without the formation of cystic growths. The proliferative potential of grafts was proportional to the reduction of replication fork speed during pancreatic differentiation.

Unfortunately, they fail to increase human \u03b2 cell proliferation. Small-molecule inhibitors of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) are able to induce adult human \u03b2 cell proliferation, but rates are modest (~2%), and their specificity to \u03b2 cells is limited. Here, we provide evidence that combining any member of the GLP1R agonist class with any member of the DYRK1A inhibitor class induces a synergistic increase in human \u03b2 cell replication (5 to 6%) accompanied by an actual increase in numbers of human \u03b2 cells. GLP1R agonist-DYRK1A inhibitor synergy required combined inhibition of DYRK1A and an increase in cAMP and did not lead to \u03b2 cell dedifferentiation. These beneficial effects on proliferation were seen in both normal human \u03b2 cells and \u03b2 cells derived from individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The timing and neuromolecular mechanisms for these effects are relevant to the prevention and treatment of obesity. Factors implicated in a body weight \"set point\" including dietary fat, circulating leptin, and other adipokines tend to covary with adiposity and are difficult to disarticulate experimentally. To dissociate leptin effects from adiposity and diet, we created a transgenic mouse in which leptin expression is regulated by doxycycline exposure. Using this system, we investigated the physiological consequences of developmentally-timed transient hyperleptinemia on subsequent adiposity. We evaluated physiological effects of leptin elevation during adulthood (9 to 29 weeks old), \"adolescence\" (3 to 8 weeks old), and the immediate postnatal period [postnatal days 0 to 22 (P0 to P22)] on long-term adiposity and susceptibility to gain weight on high-fat diet (HFD) fed ad libitum. We found that inducing chronic hyperleptinemia in adult or \"adolescent\" mice did not alter body weight when excess leptin was discontinued, and upon later exposure to HFD, weight gain did not differ from controls. However, transient elevation of circulating leptin from P0 to P22 increased weight and fat gain in response to HFD, indicating greater susceptibility to obesity as adults. Thus, transient plasma leptin elevations-mimicking one aspect of transient adiposity-increased later susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, although these effects were restricted to a critical developmental (P0 to P22) time window.

This process is triggered, in part, by specific (aa 9-23) epitopes of the insulin \u0392 chain. Previously, fish insulins were used clinically in patients allergic to bovine or porcine insulin. Fish and human insulin differ by two amino acids in the critical immunogenic region (aa 9-23) of the B chain. We hypothesized that \u03b2 cells synthesizing fish insulin would be less immunogenic in a mouse model of T1D. Transgenic NOD mice in which Greater Amberjack fish (Seriola dumerili) insulin was substituted for the insulin 2 gene were generated (mouse Ins1-/- mouse Ins2-/- fish Ins2+/+). In these mice, pancreatic islets remained free of autoimmune attack. To determine whether such reduction in immunogenicity is sufficient to protect \u03b2 cells from autoimmunity upon transplantation, we transplanted fish Ins2 transgenic (expressing solely Seriola dumerili Ins2), NOD, or B16:A-dKO islets under the kidney capsules of 5 weeks old female NOD wildtype mice. The B:Y16A \u0392 chain substitution has been previously shown to be protective of T1D in NOD mice. NOD mice receiving Seriola dumerili transgenic islet transplants showed a significant (p\u2009=\u20090.004) prolongation of their euglycemic period (by 6 weeks; up to 18 weeks of age) compared to un-manipulated female NOD (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age) and those receiving B16:A-dKO islet transplants (diabetes onset at 12 weeks of age). These data support the concept that specific amino acid sequence modifications can reduce insulin immunogenicity. Additionally, our study shows that alteration of a single epitope is not sufficient to halt an ongoing autoimmune response. Which, and how many, T cell epitopes are required and suffice to perpetuate autoimmunity is currently unknown.

These findings suggest that apparently functional intronic polymorphisms affect hypothalamic RPGRIP1L expression and impact development of POMC neurons and their derivatives, leading to hyperphagia and increased adiposity.", "Keywords": ["Embryonic development", "Metabolism", "NPY", "Neuroscience", "Obesity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alain J", "Last Name": "De Solis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuronal Control of Metabolism, Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yossef", "Last Name": "Goffer", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Birkenbach", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Staci E", "Last Name": "Engle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ross", "Last Name": "Tanis", "Affiliation": "University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob M", "Last Name": "Levenson", "Affiliation": "University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xueting", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition graduate program, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Rausch", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manika", "Last Name": "Purohit", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jen-Yi", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Laboratory Molecular Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerica", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria Caterina", "Last Name": "De Rosa", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia A", "Last Name": "Doege", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Holly L", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Laboratory Molecular Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela J", "Last Name": "Martins", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jens C", "Last Name": "Br\u00fcning", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuronal Control of Metabolism, Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Berbari", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Stratigopoulos", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019Feb07"}, {"PMID": "30712508", "Title": "NanoMod: a computational tool to detect DNA modifications using Nanopore long-read sequencing data.", "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-molecule sequencing techniques, such as Nanopore sequencing, improved read length, increased sequencing throughput, and enabled direct detection of DNA modifications through the analysis of raw signals.

Elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of beta cell development, expansion, survival, and function are required for full understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of diabetes.

In the present study we investigated hepatic biochemical and anatomic phenotypes of Cre-mediated Ildr2 knock-out mice. Liver-specific Ildr2 knock-out mice were generated in C57BL/6J mice segregating for a floxed (exon 1) allele of Ildr2, using congenital and acute (10-13-week-old male mice) Cre expression. In addition, Ildr2 shRNA was administered to Ildr2 knock-out mice to test the effects of Ildr2 shRNA, per se, in the absence of Ildr2 expression. RNA sequencing was performed on livers of these knockdown and knockout mice. Congenital and acute liver-specific and hepatocyte-specific knockout mice did not develop hepatic steatosis. However, administration of Ildr2 shRNA to Ildr2 knock-out mice did cause hepatic steatosis, indicating that the Ildr2 shRNA had apparent \"off-target\" effects on gene(s) other than Ildr2. RNA sequencing and BLAST sequence alignment revealed Dgka as a candidate gene mediating these \"off-target\" effects. Ildr2 shRNA is 63% homologous to the Dgka gene, and Dgka expression decreased only in mice displaying hepatic steatosis. Dgka encodes diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) alpha, one of a family of DGKs which convert diacylglycerides to phosphatidic acid for second messenger signaling. Dgka knockdown mice would be expected to accumulate diacylglyceride, contributing to the observed hepatic steatosis. We conclude that ILDR2 plays a negligible role in hepatic steatosis. Rather, hepatic steatosis observed previously in Ildr2 knockdown mice was likely due to shRNA targeting of Dgka and/or other \"off-target\" genes.

Here, we evaluated the effects of rs8050136 and another potential CUX1 element in rs1421085 on expression of nearby genes in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) neurons. There were allele-dosage effects on FTO, RPGRIP1L, and AKT-interacting protein (AKTIP) expression, but expression of other vicinal genes, including IRX3, IRX5, and RBL2, which have been implicated in mediating functional effects, was not altered. In vivo manipulation of CUX1, Fto, and/or Rpgrip1l expression in mice affected adiposity in a manner that was consistent with CUX1 influence on adiposity via remote effects on Fto and Rpgrip1l expression. In support of a mechanism, mice hypomorphic for Rpgrip1l exhibited hyperphagic obesity, as the result of diminished leptin sensitivity in Leprb-expressing neurons.

Here we generated and analysed a collection of human parthenogenetic ES cell lines originating from haploid oocytes, leading to the successful isolation and maintenance of human ES cell lines with a normal haploid karyotype. Haploid human ES cells exhibited typical pluripotent stem cell characteristics, such as self-renewal capacity and a pluripotency-specific molecular signature. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility of these cells as a platform for loss-of-function genetic screening. Although haploid human ES cells resembled their diploid counterparts, they also displayed distinct properties including differential regulation of X chromosome inactivation and of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, alongside reduction in absolute gene expression levels and cell size. Surprisingly, we found that a haploid human genome is compatible not only with the undifferentiated pluripotent state, but also with differentiated somatic fates representing all three embryonic germ layers both in vitro and in vivo, despite a persistent dosage imbalance between the autosomes and X chromosome.

In this review, we will discuss the utility of stem cell-derived beta cells to investigate the mechanisms of beta cell failure in diabetes, and the challenges to develop beta cell replacement therapies. These challenges include appropriate quality controls of the cells being used, the ability to generate beta cell grafts of stable cellular composition, and in the case of type 1 diabetes, protecting implanted cells from autoimmune destruction without compromising other aspects of the immune system or the functionality of the graft. Such novel treatments will need to match or exceed the relative safety and efficacy of available care for diabetes.", "Keywords": ["beta cells", "cell replacement therapy", "stem cells", "type 1 diabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autografts", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Humans", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Islets of Langerhans Transplantation", "Kidney Transplantation", "Transplantation Immunology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bjarki", "Last Name": "Johannesson", "Affiliation": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Sui", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald O", "Last Name": "Freytes", "Affiliation": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, New York, NY, USA Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center & Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA de2220@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The EMBO journal", "PubDate": "2015Apr01"}, {"PMID": "25555215", "Title": "Differentiation of hypothalamic-like neurons from human pluripotent stem cells.", "Abstract": "The hypothalamus is the central regulator of systemic energy homeostasis, and its dysfunction can result in extreme body weight alterations.

Combined early activation of sonic hedgehog signaling followed by timed NOTCH inhibition in human ESCs/iPSCs resulted in efficient conversion into hypothalamic NKX2.1+ precursors. Application of a NOTCH inhibitor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) further directed the cells into arcuate nucleus hypothalamic-like neurons that express hypothalamic neuron markers proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), somatostatin, and dopamine. These hypothalamic-like neurons accounted for over 90% of differentiated cells and exhibited transcriptional profiles defined by a hypothalamic-specific gene expression signature that lacked pituitary markers. Importantly, these cells displayed hypothalamic neuron characteristics, including production and secretion of neuropeptides and increased p-AKT and p-STAT3 in response to insulin and leptin.

Developmental efficiency varied between oocyte donors, and was inversely related to the number of days of hormonal stimulation required for oocyte maturation, whereas the daily dose of gonadotropin or the total number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved did not affect developmental outcome. Because the use of concentrated Sendai virus for cell fusion induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, causing premature oocyte activation, we used diluted Sendai virus in calcium-free medium.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 9 million older Americans, and is characterized by the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the closely linked genome-wide association studies ARMS2/HTRA1 genes, located at the chromosome 10q26 locus, are strongly associated with the risk of AMD, their downstream targets are unknown. Low population frequencies of risk alleles in tissue banks make it impractical to study their function in cells derived from autopsied tissue. Moreover, autopsy eyes from end-stage AMD patients, where age-related RPE atrophy and fibrosis are already present, cannot be used to determine how abnormal ARMS2/HTRA1 expression can initiate RPE pathology. Instead, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE from patients provides us with earlier stage AMD patient-specific cells and allows us to analyze the underlying mechanisms at this critical time point. An unbiased proteome screen of A2E-aged patient-specific iPS-derived RPE cell lines identified superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative defense in the genetic allele's susceptibility of AMD. The AMD-associated risk haplotype (T-in/del-A) impairs the ability of the RPE to defend against aging-related oxidative stress. SOD2 defense is impaired in RPE homozygous for the risk haplotype (T-in/del-A; T-in/del-A), while the effect was less pronounced in RPE homozygous for the protective haplotype (G-Wt-G; G-Wt-G).

Acf1 (also known as BAZ1A in mammals) is a defining subunit of the conserved ISWI-family chromatin remodelers ACF and CHRAC, first purified over 15 years ago from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Much is known about biochemical properties of ACF and CHRAC, which move nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo to establish ordered chromatin arrays. Genetic studies in yeast, flies and cultured human cells clearly implicate these complexes in transcriptional repression via control of chromatin structures. RNAi experiments in transformed mammalian cells in culture also implicate ACF and CHRAC in DNA damage checkpoints and double-strand break repair. However, their essential in vivo roles in mammals are unknown. Here, we show that Baz1a-knockout mice are viable and able to repair developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks in the immune system and germ line, I-SceI endonuclease-induced breaks in primary fibroblasts via homologous recombination, and DNA damage from mitomycin C exposure in vivo. However, Baz1a deficiency causes male-specific sterility in accord with its high expression in male germ cells, where it displays dynamic, stage-specific patterns of chromosomal localization. Sterility is caused by pronounced defects in sperm development, most likely a consequence of massively perturbed gene expression in spermatocytes and round spermatids in the absence of BAZ1A: the normal spermiogenic transcription program is largely intact but more than 900 other genes are mis-regulated, primarily reflecting inappropriate up-regulation. We propose that large-scale changes in chromatin composition that occur during spermatogenesis create a window of vulnerability to promiscuous transcription changes, with an essential function of ACF and/or CHRAC chromatin remodeling activities being to safeguard against these alterations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Chromatin", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Repair", "Drosophila", "Fibroblasts", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Infertility, Male", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nucleosomes", "Primary Cell Culture", "Spermatogenesis", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Dowdle", "Affiliation": "Louis V.

Failure to select high quality colonies early in the derivation process results in cell lines that require increased maintenance and unreliable experimental outcomes.

This technique prospectively isolates fully reprogrammed iPSCs, and depletes both parental and \"contaminating\" partially reprogrammed fibroblasts, thereby substantially reducing the time and reagents required to generate iPSC lines without the use of defined small molecule cocktails. FACS derived iPSC lines express common markers of pluripotency, and possess spontaneous differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the suitability of FACS for high-throughput iPSC generation, we derived 228 individual iPSC lines using either integrating (retroviral) or non- integrating (Sendai virus) reprogramming vectors and performed extensive characterization on a subset of those lines.
