Although abstinence from alcohol after diagnosis of ALD improves life expectancy and reduces the risk of decompensation of liver disease, few studies have evaluated whether treatment of alcohol use disorders will reduce progression of liver disease and improve liver-related outcomes. In November 2021, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism commissioned a task force that included hepatologists, addiction medicine specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists and members of regulatory agencies to develop recommendations for the design and conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the effect of alcohol use, particularly treatment to reduce or eliminate alcohol use in patients with ALD. The task force conducted extensive reviews of relevant literature on alcohol use disorders and ALD. Findings were presented at one in-person meeting and discussed over the next 16 months to develop the final recommendations.

We developed a curated list of 502 genes for monogenic disorders associated with liver phenotypes and analyzed ES data for these genes in 758 patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). For comparison, we examined ES data in 7856 self-declared healthy controls (HC), and 2187 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Candidate pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were initially identified in 19.9% of participants, most of which were attributable to previously reported pathogenic variants with implausibly high allele frequencies. After variant annotation and filtering based on population minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-4 for dominant disorders and MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-3 for recessive disorders), we detected a significant enrichment of P/LP variants in the CLD cohort compared to the HC cohort (X2 test OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.06-8.18, p value\u2009=\u20094.5e-12). A second-level manual annotation was necessary to capture true pathogenic variants that were removed by stringent allele frequency and quality filters. After these sequential steps, the diagnostic rate of monogenic disorders was 5.7% in the CLD cohort, attributable to P/LP variants in 25 genes. We also identified concordant liver disease phenotypes for 15/22 kidney disease patients with P/LP variants in liver genes, mostly associated with cystic liver disease phenotypes. Sequencing results had many implications for clinical management, including familial testing for early diagnosis and management, preventative screening for associated comorbidities, and in some cases for therapy. Exome sequencing provided a 5.7% diagnostic rate in CLD patients and required multiple rounds of review to reduce both false positive and false negative findings. The identification of concordant phenotypes in many patients with P/LP variants and no known liver disease also indicates a potential for predictive testing for selected monogenic liver disorders.",

This article reports the findings and recommendations regarding innovations and advances in approaches to donor-recipient matching challenges, the technical aspects of the donor and recipient operations, and surgical training. Among these themes, the barriers deemed most influential/detrimental to LDLT expansion in the United States included: (1) prohibitive issues related to donor age, graft size, insufficient donor remnant, and ABO incompatibility; (2) lack of acknowledgment and awareness of the excellent outcomes and benefits of LDLT; (3) ambiguous messaging regarding LDLT to patients and hospital leadership; and (4) a limited number of proficient LDLT surgeons across the United States. Donor-recipient mismatching may be circumvented by way of liver paired exchange. The creation of a national registry to generate granular data on donor-recipient matching will guide the practice of liver paired exchange. The surgical challenges to LDLT are addressed herein and focuses on the development of robust training pathways resulting in proficiency in donor and recipient surgery. Utilizing strong mentorship/collaboration programs with novel training practices under the auspices of established training and certification bodies will add to the breadth and depth of training.", "Keywords": ["ABO Incompatible", "living donor liver transplantation", "living paired exchanges", "surgical training"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Blood Group Incompatibility", "Liver Transplantation", "Living Donors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Sturdevant", "Affiliation": "University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Swaytha", "Last Name": "Ganesh", "Affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Samstein", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Davalos", "Affiliation": "Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vineeta", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Comprehensive Transplant Institute, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marwan", "Last Name": "Abouljoud", "Affiliation": "Henry Ford Transplant Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oya", "Last Name": "Andacoglu", "Affiliation": "University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma, Oklahoma, USA."}, {"First Name": "Medhat", "Last Name": "Askar", "Affiliation": "Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Broering", "Affiliation": "King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Juliet", "Last Name": "Emamaullee", "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine E", "Last Name": "Haugen", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle T", "Last Name": "Jesse", "Affiliation": "Henry Ford Transplant Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mureo", "Last Name": "Kasahara", "Affiliation": "National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "AnnMarie", "Last Name": "Liapakis", "Affiliation": "Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Transplant Center, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Mandelbrot", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anjana", "Last Name": "Pillai", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Garrett R", "Last Name": "Roll", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nazia", "Last Name": "Selzner", "Affiliation": "Ajmera Transplant Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sukru", "Last Name": "Emre", "Affiliation": "University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "AST LDLT Consensus Conference Working Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplantation", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37029083", "Title": "Development and validation of a REcurrent Liver cAncer Prediction ScorE (RELAPSE) following liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Analysis of the US Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium.", "Abstract": "HCC recurrence following liver transplantation (LT) is highly morbid and occurs despite strict patient selection criteria.

Of 4981 UMHTC patients with HCC undergoing LT, 71.9% were within Milan criteria, 16.1% were initially beyond Milan criteria with 9.4% downstaged before LT, and 12.0% had incidental HCC on explant pathology. Overall and recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 89.7%, 78.6%, and 69.8% and 86.8%, 74.9%, and 66.7%, respectively, with a 5-year incidence of HCC recurrence of 12.5% (median 16\u00a0months) and non-HCC mortality of 20.8%. A multivariable model identified maximum alpha-fetoprotein (HR = 1.35 per-log SD, 95% CI,1.22-1.50, p < 0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.16 per-log SD, 95% CI,1.04-1.28, p < 0.006), pathologic maximum tumor diameter (HR = 1.53 per-log SD, 95% CI, 1.35-1.73, p < 0.001), microvascular (HR = 2.37, 95%-CI, 1.87-2.99, p < 0.001) and macrovascular (HR = 3.38, 95% CI, 2.41-4.75, p < 0.001) invasion, and tumor differentiation (moderate HR = 1.75, 95% CI, 1.29-2.37, p < 0.001; poor HR = 2.62, 95% CI, 1.54-3.32, p < 0.001) as independent variables predicting post-LT HCC recurrence (C-statistic = 0.78). Machine learning algorithms incorporating additional covariates improved prediction of recurrence (Random Survival Forest C-statistic = 0.81). Despite significant differences in European Hepatocellular Cancer Liver Transplant recipient radiologic, treatment, and pathologic characteristics, external validation of RELAPSE demonstrated consistent 2- and 5-year recurrence risk discrimination (AUCs 0.77 and 0.75, respectively). We developed and externally validated a RELAPSE score that accurately discriminates post-LT HCC recurrence risk and may allow for individualized post-LT surveillance, immunosuppression modification, and selection of high-risk patients for adjuvant therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Liver Neoplasms", "Liver Transplantation", "Risk Factors", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Retrospective Studies", "Recurrence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin V", "Last Name": "Tran", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Dumont-UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Transplant and Liver Cancer Centers, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dimitrios", "Last Name": "Moris", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Markovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Statistics Core, University of California, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hamed", "Last Name": "Zaribafzadeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ricardo", "Last Name": "Henao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Quirino", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "General Surgery and Organ Transplantation Unit, Sapienza University, AOU Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sander S", "Last Name": "Florman", "Affiliation": "Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Parissa", "Last Name": "Tabrizian", "Affiliation": "Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandy", "Last Name": "Haydel", "Affiliation": "Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "Annette C. and Harold C.

In NAFLD, HCC may occur at earlier stages of fibrosis and present with more advanced tumor stage, raising concern for aggressive disease. Thus, adult LT recipients with HCC from 20 US centers transplanted between 2002 and 2013 were analyzed to determine whether NAFLD impacts recurrence-free post-LT survival. Five hundred and thirty-eight (10.8%) of 4981 total patients had NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD were significantly older (63 vs. 58, p<0.001), had higher body mass index (30.5 vs. 27.4, p<0.001), and were more likely to have diabetes (57.3% vs. 28.8%, p<0.001). Patients with NAFLD were less likely to receive pre-LT locoregional therapy (63.6% vs. 72.9%, p<0.001), had higher median lab MELD (15 vs. 13, p<0.001) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (3.8 vs. 2.9, p<0.001), and were more likely to have their maximum pre-LT alpha fetoprotein at time of LT (44.1% vs. 36.1%, p<0.001). NAFLD patients were more likely to have an incidental HCC on explant (19.4% vs. 10.4%, p<0.001); however, explant characteristics including tumor differentiation and vascular invasion were not different between groups. Comparing NAFLD and non-NAFLD patients, the 1, 3, and 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence (3.1%, 9.1%, 11.5% vs. 4.9%, 10.1%, 12.6%, p=0.36) and recurrence-free survival rates (87%, 76%, and 67% vs. 87%, 75%, and 67%, p=0.97) were not different. In competing risks analysis, NAFLD did not significantly impact recurrence in univariable (HR: 0.88, p=0.36) nor in adjusted analysis (HR: 0.91, p=0.49). With NAFLD among the most common causes of HCC and poised to become the leading indication for LT, a better understanding of disease-specific models to predict recurrence is needed. In this NAFLD cohort, incidental HCCs were common, raising concerns about early detection.

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult SLKT recipients between 2002 and 2017 at six centers in six United Network for Organ Sharing regions in the US Multicenter SLKT Consortium. The primary outcome was a CVE defined as hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or other CV causes (stroke or peripheral vascular disease) within 1\u2009year of SLKT. Among 515 SLKT subjects (mean age \u00b1 SD, 55.4 \u00b1\u200910.6\u2009years; 35.5% women; 68.1% White), 8.7% had a CVE within 1\u2009year of SLKT. The prevalence of a CVE increased from 3.3% in 2002-2008 to 8.9% in 2009-2011 to 14.0% in 2012-2017 ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0005).

There was a trend toward older age by era of SLKT ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.054). In multivariate analysis adjusted for cardiac risk factors at transplant, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02, 1.11), CAD (OR, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.60, 8.18), and AF (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.14, 4.89) were associated with a 1-year CVE after SLKT.

We used data from the US Multicenter SLKT Consortium cohort study of all adult SLKT recipients between 2002 and 2017 who were discharged alive following SLKT. We used Poisson regression to model rates of early hospitalizations after SLKT. Cox regression was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality conditional on survival at 6\u00a0months after SLKT. Median age (N\u00a0=\u00a0549) was 57.7\u2009years (interquartile range [IQR], 50.6-63.9) with 63% males and 76% Whites; 33% had hepatitis C virus, 20% had non-alcohol-associated fatty liver disease, 23% alcohol-associated liver disease, and 24% other etiologies.

Two-thirds of the cohort had at least one hospitalization within the first 6\u00a0months of SLKT. Age, race, hospitalization at SLKT, diabetes mellitus, BMI, and discharge to subacute rehabilitation (SAR) facility after SLKT were independently associated with a high incidence rate ratio of early hospitalization. Number of hospitalizations within the first 6\u00a0months did not affect conditional survival. Early hospitalizations after SLKT were very common but did not affect conditional survival. Although most of the risk factors for early hospitalization were nonmodifiable, discharge to SAR after initial SLKT was associated with a significantly higher incidence rate of early hospitalization.

What is unknown is the impact of physical frailty on the development of AKI. We included adults with cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma listed for liver transplantation at nine US centers (n\u00a0=\u00a01,033). Frailty was assessed using the Liver Frailty Index (LFI); \"frail\" was defined by LFI\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.2. Chronic kidney disease as a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate <60\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 . Our primary outcome, AKI, was defined as an increase in serum creatinine \u22650.3\u00a0mg/dL or a serum creatinine \u22651.5-fold increase. Wait-list mortality was defined as either a death on the wait list or removal for being too sick. We performed Cox regression analyses to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for AKI and wait-list mortality. Of 1,033 participants, 41% were frail and 23% had CKD. Twenty-one percent had an episode of AKI during follow-up. Frail versus nonfrail patients were more likely to develop AKI (25% vs. 19%) and wait-list mortality (21% vs. 13%) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for each). In multivariable Cox regression, each of the following groups was associated with a higher risk of AKI as compared with not frail/no CKD: frail/no CKD (adjusted HR [aHR]\u00a0=\u00a01.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.29-2.72); not frail/CKD (aHR\u00a0=\u00a04.30, CI\u00a0=\u00a02.88-6.42); and frail/CKD (aHR\u00a0=\u00a04.85, CI\u00a0=\u00a03.33-7.07). We use a readily available metric, LFI, to identify those patients with cirrhosis most at risk for AKI. We highlight that serum creatinine and creatinine-based estimations of glomerular filtration rate may not fully capture a patient's vulnerability to AKI among the frail phenotype.

Physical frailty can be assessed using performance-based tests, but the extent to which impaired cognition may impact performance is not well characterized. We assessed the relationship between impaired cognition and physical frailty in patients with cirrhosis. We enrolled 1,623 ambulatory adult patients with cirrhosis waiting for liver transplantation at 10 sites. Frailty was assessed with the liver frailty index (LFI; \"frail,\" LFI\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.4). Cognition was assessed at the same visit with the number connection test (NCT); continuous \"impaired cognition\" was examined in primary analysis, with longer NCT (more seconds) indicating worse impaired cognition. For descriptive statistics, \"impaired cognition\" was NCT\u00a0\u2265\u00a045\u00a0seconds. Linear regression associated frailty and impaired cognition; competing risk regression estimated subhazard ratios (sHRs) of wait-list mortality (i.e., death/delisting for sickness). Median NCT was 41\u00a0seconds, and 42% had impaired cognition. Median LFI (4.2 vs. 3.8) and rates of frailty (38% vs. 20%) differed between those with and without impaired cognition. In adjusted analysis, every\u00a010-second NCT\u00a0increase associated with a\u00a00.08-LFI\u00a0increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.10). In univariable analysis, both frailty (sHR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.43-1.87) and impaired cognition (sHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.10) associated with wait-list mortality. After adjustment, frailty but not impaired cognition remained significantly associated with wait-list mortality (sHR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.33-1.79). Impaired cognition mediated 7.4% (95% CI, 2.0%-16.4%) of the total effect of frailty on 1-year wait-list mortality. Conclusion: Patients with cirrhosis with higher impaired cognition displayed higher rates of physical frailty, yet frailty independently associated with wait-list mortality while impaired cognition did not.

Despite few high-quality randomized controlled trials to guide therapeutic decisions, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation has emerged as a crucial therapeutic option to treat complications of portal hypertension. In North America, the decision to perform TIPS involves gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and interventional radiologists, but TIPS creation is performed by interventional radiologists. This is in contrast to other parts of the world where TIPS creation is performed primarily by hepatologists. Thus, the successful use of TIPS in North America is dependent on a multidisciplinary approach and technical expertise, so as to optimize outcomes. Recently, new procedural techniques, TIPS stent technology, and indications for TIPS have emerged. As a result, practices and outcomes vary greatly across institutions and significant knowledge gaps exist. In this consensus statement, the Advancing Liver Therapeutic Approaches group critically reviews the application of TIPS in the management of portal hypertension. Advancing Liver Therapeutic Approaches convened a multidisciplinary group of North American experts from hepatology, interventional radiology, transplant surgery, nephrology, cardiology, pulmonology, and hematology to critically review existing literature and develop practice-based recommendations for the use of TIPS in patients with any cause of portal hypertension in terms of candidate selection, procedural best practices and, post-TIPS management; and to develop areas of consensus for TIPS indications and the prevention of complications. Finally, future research directions are identified related to TIPS for the management of portal hypertension.", "Keywords": ["Ascites", "Cirrhosis", "Complications", "Consensus Statement", "End-Stage

Despite the fact that solid organ transplant recipients in particular are at increased risk of infections from multidrug-resistant organisms, due to host and donor factors and immunosuppressive therapy, there currently are little rigorous data regarding stewardship practices in solid organ transplant populations, and thus, no transplant-specific requirements currently exist. Further complicating matters, transplant patients have a wide range of variability regarding their susceptibility to infection, as factors such as surgery of transplant, intensity of immunosuppression, and presence of drains or catheters in situ may modify the risk of infection. As such, it is not feasible to have a \"one-size-fits-all\" style of stewardship for this patient population. The objective of this white paper is to identify opportunities, risk factors, and ASP strategies that should be assessed with solid organ transplant recipients to optimize antimicrobial use, while producing an overall improvement in patient outcomes.

However, little is known about the renal-related outcomes following SLKT, which are essential to maximize the health of these allografts. We examined the factors impacting renal function following SLKT. This is an observational multicenter cohort study from the US Multicenter SLKT Consortium consisting of recipients of SLKT aged \u226518\u00a0years of transplantations performed between February 2002 and June 2017 at 6 large US centers in 6 different United Network for Organ Sharing regions. The primary outcome was incident post-SLKT stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as <30\u00a0mL/minute/1.73\u00a0m2 or listing for kidney transplant. The median age of the recipients (n\u00a0=\u00a0570) was 58\u00a0years (interquartile range, 51-64 years), and 37% were women, 76% were White, 33% had hepatitis C virus infection, 20% had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 23% had alcohol-related liver disease; 68% developed \u2265 stage 3 CKD at the end of follow-up. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year incidence rates of post-SLKT stage 4-5 CKD were 10%, 12%, and 16%, respectively.

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled all adult SOT recipients at our center with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent antibody testing with a single commercially available anti-nucleocapsid antibody test at least 7\u00a0days after diagnosis in a retrospective cohort. Seventy SOT recipients were studied (56% kidney, 19% lung, 14% liver \u00b1 kidney, and 11% heart \u00b1 kidney recipients). Thirty-six (51%) had positive anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing, and 34 (49%) were negative. Recipients of a kidney allograft were less likely to have positive antibody testing compared to those who did not receive a kidney (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). In the final multivariable model, the years from transplant to diagnosis (OR 1.26, p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and baseline immunosuppression with more than two agents (OR 0.26, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) were significantly associated with the antibody test result, controlling for kidney transplantation. In conclusion, among SOT recipients with confirmed infection, only 51% of patients had detectable anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and transplant-related variables including the level and nature of immunosuppression were important predictors.

The anticipated use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant (LT) recipients is reviewed and practical guidance is provided for health care providers involved in the care of patients with liver disease and LT about vaccine prioritization and administration. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a 94%-95% vaccine efficacy compared to placebo against COVID-19. Local site reactions of pain and tenderness were reported in 70%-90% of clinical trial participants, and systemic reactions of fever and fatigue were reported in 40%-70% of participants, but these reactions were generally mild and self-limited and occurred more frequently in younger persons. Severe hypersensitivity reactions related to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare and more commonly observed in women and persons with a history of previous drug reactions for unclear reasons. Because patients with advanced liver disease and immunosuppressed patients were excluded from the vaccine licensing trials, additional data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are eagerly awaited in these and other subgroups. Remarkably safe and highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are now available for widespread use and should be given to all adult patients with CLD and LT recipients.

Older patients are increasingly receiving transplants as a result of HCC, but the impact of advancing age on long-term posttransplant outcomes is not clear. To study this, we used data from the US Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium of 4980 patients. We divided the patients into 4 groups by age at transplantation: 18 to 64 years (n\u00a0=\u00a04001), 65 to 69 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0683), 70 to 74 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0252), and \u226575\u00a0years (n\u00a0=\u00a044). There were no differences in HCC tumor stage, type of bridging locoregional therapy, or explant residual tumor between the groups. Older age was confirmed to be an independent and significant predictor of overall survival even after adjusting for demographic, etiologic, and cancer-related factors on multivariable analysis. A dose-response effect of age on survival was observed, with every 5-year increase in age older than 50\u00a0years resulting in an absolute increase of 8.3% in the mortality rate. Competing risk analysis revealed that older patients experienced higher rates of non-HCC-related mortality (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and not HCC-related death (P\u00a0=\u00a00.24). To delineate the precise cause of death, we further analyzed a single-center cohort of patients who received a transplant as a result of HCC (n\u00a0=\u00a0302). Patients older than 65\u00a0years had a higher incidence of de novo cancer (18.1% versus 7.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) after transplantation and higher overall cancer-related mortality (14.3% versus 6.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Even carefully selected elderly patients with HCC have significantly worse posttransplant survival rates, which are mostly driven by non-HCC-related causes.

Here we describe renal function and characteristics associated with renal dysfunction at 30 days post-TIPS. Adults with cirrhosis who underwent TIPS at 9 hospitals in the United States from 2010 to 2015 were included. We defined \"post-TIPS renal dysfunction\" as a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (\u0394eGFR) \u2264-15 and eGFR\u00a0\u2264\u00a060\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or new renal replacement therapy (RRT) at day 30. We identified the characteristics associated with post-TIPS renal dysfunction by logistic regression and evaluated survival using adjusted competing risk regressions. Of the 673 patients, the median age was 57 years, 38% of the patients were female, 26% had diabetes mellitus, and the median MELD-Na was 17. After 30 days post-TIPS, 66 (10%) had renal dysfunction, of which 23 (35%) required new RRT. Patients with post-TIPS renal dysfunction, compared with those with stable renal function, were more likely to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 33% versus 17%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and comorbid diabetes mellitus (42% versus 24%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Multivariate logistic regressions showed NAFLD (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-4.17; P\u00a0=\u00a00.05), serum sodium (Na; OR, 1.06 per mEq/L; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.16-3.61; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) were associated with post-TIPS renal dysfunction. Competing risk regressions showed that those with post-TIPS renal dysfunction were at a higher subhazard of death (subhazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.18-2.56; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In this large, multicenter cohort, we found NAFLD, diabetes mellitus, and baseline Na associated with post-TIPS renal dysfunction.

Older LT recipients with NASH may be at an increased risk for adverse outcomes after LT. Our objective is to characterize outcomes in these recipients in a large multicenter cohort. All primary LT recipients \u226565\u00a0years from 2010 to 2016 at 13 centers in the Re-Evaluating Age Limits in Transplantation (REALT) consortium were included. Of 1023 LT recipients, 226 (22.1%) were over 70 years old, and 207 (20.2%) had NASH. Compared with other LT recipients, NASH recipients were older (68.0 versus 67.3\u00a0years), more likely to be female (47.3% versus 32.8%), White (78.3% versus 68.0%), Hispanic (12.1% versus 9.2%), and had higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium (21 versus 18) at LT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all). Specific cardiac risk factors including diabetes with or without chronic complications (69.6%), hypertension (66.3%), hyperlipidemia (46.3%), coronary artery disease (36.7%), and moderate-to-severe renal disease (44.4%) were highly prevalent among NASH LT recipients. Graft survival among NASH patients was 90.3% at 1\u00a0year and 82.4% at 3\u00a0years compared with 88.9% at 1\u00a0year and 80.4% at 3\u00a0years for non-NASH patients (log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.58 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.59, respectively). Within 1 year after LT, the incidence of graft rejection (17.4%), biliary strictures (20.9%), and solid organ cancers (4.9%) were comparable. Rates of cardiovascular (CV) complications, renal failure, and infection were also similar in both groups. We observed similar posttransplant morbidity and mortality outcomes for NASH and non-NASH LT recipients.

Clinical research in hepatology has had a rich tradition in several domains, including the discovery and therapeutic development for diseases such as hepatitis B and C and studying the natural history of many forms of chronic liver disease. National Institutes of Health, foundation, and industry funding have provided important opportunities to advance the academic careers of young investigators while they strived to make contributions to the field. Instantaneously, however, all nonessential research activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical research to rethink their research strategy, including a shift to coronavirus disease 2019 research while endeavoring to maintain their preexisting agenda. Strategies to maintain the integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow-up, safety assessments, and continuation of investigational products, have included a shift to telemedicine, remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to study subjects. As a revamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of studies in the predetermined time frame, and the need to reprogram career path timelines. Real-world databases, biomarker and long-term follow up studies, and research involving special groups (children, the homeless, and other marginalized populations) are likely to face unique challenges. The implementation of telemedicine has been dramatically accelerated and will serve as a backbone for the future of clinical research. As we move forward, innovation in clinical trial design will be essential for conducting optimized clinical research.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Forecasting", "Gastroenterology", "Humans", "Male", "Needs Assessment", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Program Development", "Program Evaluation", "Research Design", "Telemedicine", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Serper", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."}, {"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Hepatology, Mt.

Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age of 57\u00a0years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, and 27 (30%) severe disease. Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged.

In particular, the opioid crisis has led to a significant shift in incident hepatitis C virus infection to younger populations and to women, leading to changes in screening recommendations. Less well characterized are the potential direct and indirect hepatotoxic effects of opioids, as well as the changes in the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection and alcohol abuse that are likely rising in this population as well. Finally, the opioid epidemic has led to a significant rise in the proportion of organ donors who died due to overdose. These donors have led to an overall increase in donor numbers, but also to new considerations about the better use of donors with perceived or actual risk of disease transmission, especially hepatitis C.

All patients listed for LT in the United States between 2002 and 2017 were analyzed, excluding those listed with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exceptions. The primary outcome was post-LT mortality. We defined pre-LT CKD as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/minute for 90 days or \u226542 days of hemodialysis. Cox regression determined the association between pre-LT CKD and post-LT mortality. Of 78,640 LT candidates, the proportion with CKD among LT recipients increased from 7.8% in 2002 to 14.6% in 2017 (test for trend, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease. The gut microbiota promotes ethanol-induced liver disease in mice4, but little is known about the microbial factors that are responsible for this process. Here we identify cytolysin-a two-subunit exotoxin that is secreted by Enterococcus faecalis5,6-as a cause of hepatocyte death and liver injury. Compared with non-alcoholic individuals or patients with alcohol-use disorder, patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased faecal numbers of E.\u00a0faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E.\u00a0faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Using humanized mice that were colonized with bacteria from the faeces of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we investigated the therapeutic effects of bacteriophages that target cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis. We found that these bacteriophages decrease cytolysin in the liver and abolish ethanol-induced liver disease in humanized mice. Our findings link cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis with more severe clinical outcomes and increased mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. We show that bacteriophages can specifically target cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis, which provides a method for precisely editing the intestinal microbiota.

In the last decade, significant work has been done to better understand how to risk stratify LT candidates for recurrence of HCC following transplant using a combination of biomarker and imaging findings. However, despite the high frequency of HCC in the LT population, guidance regarding posttransplant management is lacking. In particular, there is no current evidence to support specific post-LT surveillance strategies, leading to significant heterogeneity in practices. In addition, there are no current recommendations regarding recurrence prevention, including immunosuppression regimen or secondary prevention with adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, guidance on treatment of disease recurrence is also lacking and there is significant controversy about the use of immunotherapy in transplant recipients due to the risk of rejection.

We prospectively recruited 177 adult patients undergoing LT at a single tertiary care center. 16\u2009S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing was performed on 723 fecal samples collected pre-LT and periodically until one-year post-LT to test whether MDRB colonization was associated with decreased microbiome diversity.

In this setting, little is known about commensal fungi in the gut. We studied the intestinal mycobiota in a cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, patients with alcohol use disorder, and nonalcoholic controls using fungal-specific internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing of fecal samples. We further measured serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) as a systemic immune response to fungal products or fungi. Candida was the most abundant genus in the fecal mycobiota of the two alcohol groups, whereas genus Penicillium dominated the mycobiome of nonalcoholic controls. We observed a lower diversity in the alcohol groups compared with controls. Antibiotic or steroid treatment was not associated with a lower diversity. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly higher ASCA levels compared to patients with alcohol use disorder and to nonalcoholic controls. Within the alcoholic hepatitis cohort, patients with levels of at least 34 IU/mL had a significantly lower 90-day survival (59%) compared with those with ASCA levels less than 34 IU/mL (80%) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.13 (95% CI, 1.11-8.82; P\u00a0=\u00a00.031). Conclusion: Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have a lower fungal diversity with an overgrowth of Candida compared with controls.

Despite this well-recognized phenomena in patients with end-stage liver disease, the impact of gut dysbiosis and its rate of recovery following liver transplantation (LT) remains incompletely understood. The mechanisms by which alterations in the gut microbiota impact allograft metabolism and immunity, both directly and indirectly, are multifactorial and reflect the complexity of the gut-liver axis. Importantly, while research has largely focused on quantitative and qualitative changes in gut microbial composition, changes in microbial functionality (in the presence or absence of compositional changes) are of critical importance. Therefore, to translate functional microbiomics into clinical practice, one must understand not only the compositional but also the functional changes associated with gut dysbiosis and its resolution post-LT.

We conducted a multicenter study of HCV+LT recipients who did or did not develop DAA-IGD (1 case: 2 controls-33 vs 66). Among all treated between 2014 and 2016, DAA-IGD occurred in 3.4% (33/978). IGD occurred only after treatment completion (76.0 [IQR, 47.0;176]). Among those treated, 48% had plasma cell hepatitis, 36% acute cellular rejection, 6% chronic rejection, and 9% combined findings. Median time to liver enzyme resolution was 77.5\u00a0days (IQR, 31.5;126). After diagnosis, hospitalizations, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and infection occurred in a higher percentage of cases vs controls (33% vs 7.5%, 21% vs 1.5%, 9% vs 0%; all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Only one IGD patient died and none required retransplant. A multivariate regression analysis found that liver enzyme elevations during and soon after DAA therapy completion correlated with subsequent IGD. In conclusion, while DAA-IGD is uncommon, liver enzyme elevations during or after DAA therapy may be a sign of impending IGD. These indicators should guide clinicians to diagnose and treat IGD early before the more deleterious later clinical presentation.", "Keywords": ["antibiotic: antiviral", "clinical research/practice", "immunosuppression/ immune modulation", "infection and infectious agents-viral: hepatitis C", "infectious disease", "liver allograft function/dysfunction", "liver disease: infectious", "liver transplantation/hepatology", "rejection"], "MeSH terms": ["Antiviral Agents", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Primary Graft Dysfunction", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Schiano", "Affiliation": "Recanati/ Miller Transplantation Institute and the Division of Liver Diseases, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eliana", "Last Name": "Agudelo", "Affiliation": "UCSF Medical Center Division of Liver Transplant, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Paul Haydek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maarouf", "Last Name": "Hoteit", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Penn Transplant Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcela P", "Last Name": "Laurito", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Norvell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norah", "Last Name": "Terrault", "Affiliation": "UCSF Medical Center Division of Liver Transplant, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Josh", "Last Name": "Levitsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "PubDate": "2018Oct"}, {"PMID": "29718144", "Title": "Genomic Surveillance Reveals Diversity of Multidrug-Resistant Organism Colonization and Infection: A Prospective Cohort Study in Liver Transplant Recipients.", "Abstract": "Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation.

Liver transplant (LT), kidney transplant (KT), and dual liver kidney (DLK) transplant recipients from the Hepatitis C Therapeutic Registry and Research Network database, a multicenter, longitudinal clinical care treatment cohort, treated with direct-acting antiviral regimens between January 1, 2014, and February 15, 2016, were included to assess safety and efficacy. Included were 443 posttransplant patients (KT = 60, LT = 347, DLK = 36); 42% had cirrhosis, and 54% had failed prior antiviral therapy. Most had genotype (GT) 1 (87% with 52% GT1a, 27% GT1b, and 8% GT1 no subtype) and were treated with sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir \u00b1 ribavirin (85%) followed by SOF + daclatasvir \u00b1 ribavirin (9%) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir \u00b1 ribavirin (6%). Rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks were available on 412 patients, and 395 patients (95.9%) achieved SVR at 12 weeks: 96.6%, 94.5%, and 90.9% among LT, KT, and DLK transplant recipients, respectively.

This field has been dramatically changed by the advent of safe and effective direct-acting antiviral therapy, such that most patients can be cured in the pretransplant or posttransplant setting. In addition, there are now direct-acting antiviral regimens specifically approved for use in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, patients with pre or posttransplant severe renal insufficiency remain more difficult to treat, due to mechanisms of drug metabolism in hepatic and renal failure, as well as posttransplant drug-drug interactions. Treatment options are even more restricted in non-1 HCV genotypes. Because renal insufficiency is common among patients with HCV, with decompensated cirrhosis, and in the posttransplant setting, this difficult scenario is relatively common. However, ongoing development of pangenotypic regimens with improved safety profiles, as well as additional data on dosing and safety among patients with severe renal insufficiency, will continue to expand options for cure even in these most difficult to treat patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antiviral Agents", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Liver Transplantation", "Postoperative Care", "Preoperative Care", "Renal Insufficiency", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "1 Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2017May"}, {"PMID": "28093781", "Title": "The dynamic landscape of liver transplant in the era of effective hepatitis C virus therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antiviral Agents", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "PubDate": "2017Mar"}, {"PMID": "28017845", "Title": "Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty Significantly Reduces Body Mass Index and Metabolic Complications in Obese Patients.", "Abstract": "Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is an incisionless, minimally invasive bariatric procedure that reduces the length and width of the gastric cavity to facilitate weight loss.

There were 241 living donor liver transplantations (LDLTs) and 65 deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) patients transplanted between 1998 and 2013 enrolled in the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study who were evaluated. PSC recurrence risk for LDLT and DDLT recipients was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. Cox models were used to evaluate PSC risk factors. Overall PSC recurrence probabilities were 8.7% and 22.4% at 5 and 10 years after liver transplantation (LT), respectively. The risk of PSC recurrence was not significantly different for DDLT versus LDLT recipients (P\u2009=\u20090.36).

A total of 38 cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative, cholangiography-proven BO (including 16 posttransplant and 22 nontransplant patients) and 13 patients with posttransplantation FCH-C were included. FCH-C patients were characterized by cholestatic disease, high HCV viral load, no evidence of biliary tract obstruction on imaging, and typical histopathologic findings (\u22653 of the following: 1, prominent ductular reaction; 2, hepatocyte swelling with lobular disarray; 3, periportal sinusoidal fibrosis, and 4, cholestasis). Biopsies were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Victoria blue, and rhodanine stains.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of autoimmune, indeterminate, and drug-induced ALF patients in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group from 1998-2007.

An outcome-based method to improve its diagnosis and a description of its prognosis are needed. All 1-year post-LT protocol liver biopsy samples and biopsy samples initially reported to show cholestatic HCV from patients transplanted with HCV between February 2002 and December 2009 were reviewed for the inflammation grade, the fibrosis stage, and 4 cholestatic HCV features: ductular proliferation, canalicular cholestasis with or without intracellular cholestasis, hepatocyte swelling with or without lobular disarray, and sinusoidal/pericellular fibrosis. We used patient and graft survival to define histological criteria for cholestatic HCV, and compared the clinical features of these patients to those of patients with minimal or significant post-LT fibrosis. One hundred seventy-nine patients were analyzed, the median age was 56 years, and 73% were male. Patients with 3 or more of the 4 cholestatic HCV criteria had significantly worse survival (log-rank P < 0.001) regardless of the fibrosis stage, and this was used as our novel definition of cholestatic HCV. Using this definition, we found that 27 patients (15%) had cholestatic HCV, 53 (30%) had significant fibrosis (stage \u2265 2/4), and 99 (55%) had minimal fibrosis (stage < 2/4). The final model for clinical predictors of cholestatic HCV included donor age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 per decade, P = 0.04] and previous rejection (Banff grade \u2265 5; OR = 4.19, P = 0.002). Total bilirubin was the strongest laboratory predictor of cholestatic HCV (area under the curve = 0.93), whereas the HCV viral load was not a significant predictor. The final model of post-LT survival included the pathology group {cholestatic HCV [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.07, P < 0.001] and significant fibrosis (HR = 2.53, P = 0.02)}, donor age (HR = 1.49 per decade, P < 0.001), and cold ischemia time (HR = 1.11 per hour, P = 0.02). In conclusion, we propose diagnostic criteria for cholestatic HCV that include specific criteria (the presence of at least 3 of the 4 histopathological features on biopsy) and other supportive and exclusionary criteria. Older donor age and rejection increase the risk of cholestatic HCV, and an elevation in the total bilirubin level may help to identify these patients. These criteria must be validated prospectively.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cholestasis", "Female", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032-3784, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Abdelmessih", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marcela A", "Last Name": "Salomao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roger K", "Last Name": "Moreira", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23060356", "Title": "The Hepatitis Aggressiveness Score (HAS): a novel classification system for post-liver transplantation recurrent hepatitis C.", "Abstract": "Several histopathologic features have been described in cases of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis C (FCH-C). We investigated whether FCH-associated features can be utilized as the basis of a novel grading system for the entire population of post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Liver biopsies obtained at a median (interquartile range) of 12.3 (10.4-13.8) months post-LT from 170 patients with recurrent HCV were included. Biopsies were assessed for the following FCH features: (1) ductular reaction, (2) cholestasis, (3) hepatocyte ballooning, and (4) periportal sinusoidal fibrosis. A Hepatitis Aggressiveness Score (HAS) was assigned on the basis of the number of FCH features as follows: 0 features=HAS 1; 1 to 2 features=HAS 2; and 3 to 4 features=HAS 3. We analyzed the performance of this novel system in predicting clinicopathologic outcomes compared with conventional grading systems after a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 24 (13-45.5) months. The HAS classification was highly predictive of fibrosis progression (P<0.001) and was the best predictor of graft loss in a multivariable analysis model, which included all conventional hepatitis grading systems (adjusted hazard ratio=5.5, confidence interval 2.9-10.7, P<0.001 for HAS 3 vs. HAS 1 and 2, compared with adjusted hazard ratio=1.0, confidence interval 0.5-1.9, P=0.94 for the presence of moderate to severe necroinflammation by at least 1 conventional grading system). Presence of at least 3 of 4 FCH features (HAS 3 group) characterized a subset of patients with distinctly worse prognosis and severe cholestatic disease (ie, FCH-C).
