We combined user-centered design (UCD) and implementation science (ImS) principles to design a novel telehealth-enhanced hybrid (home and clinic-based) CR (THCR) program. Methods As part of a New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) quality improvement initiative (March 2020-February 2022), we designed a THCR program using an iterative 3 step UCD process informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to: 1) identify user and contextual barriers to CR uptake (stakeholder interviews), 2) design an intervention prototype (design workshops and journey mapping), and 3) refine the prototype (usability testing). The process was optimized for usability and implementation outcomes. Results Step 1: Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (n\u2009=\u20099) at 3 geographically diverse academic medical centers revealed behavioral (e.g., self-efficacy, knowledge) and contextual (e.g., social distancing guidelines, physical space, staffing, reimbursement) barriers to uptake. Step 2: Design workshops (n\u2009=\u200920) and journey-mapping sessions (n\u2009=\u20093) with multi-disciplinary NYPH stakeholders (e.g., digital health team, CR clinicians, creative director) yielded a THCR prototype that leveraged NYPH's investment in their remote patient monitoring (RPM) platform to optimize feasibility of home-based CR sessions. Step 3: Usability testing with CR clinicians (n\u2009=\u20092) administering and CR patients (n\u2009=\u20093) participating in home-based sessions revealed usability challenges (e.g., RPM devices/exercise equipment usability; Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity/syncing; patient safety/knowledge and protocol flexibility). Design workshops (n\u2009=\u200924) and journey-mapping sessions (n\u2009=\u20093) yielded design solutions (e.g., onboarding sessions, safety surveys, fully supervised remote sessions) and a refined THCR prototype. Conclusion Combining UCD and ImS methods while engaging multi-disciplinary stakeholders in an iterative process yielded a theory-informed telehealth-enhanced hybrid CR program targeting user and contextual barriers to real-world CR implementation. We provide a detailed summary of the process, and guidance for incorporating UCD and ImS methods in early-stage intervention development. THCR may shrink the evidence-to-practice gap in CR implementation.

Implementation science is centered around stakeholder engagement and, by virtue of its reliance on theoretical frameworks, is custom built for addressing research-to-practice gaps. However, little guidance exists for how best to leverage implementation science to promote cardiovascular health equity. This American Heart Association scientific statement was commissioned to define implementation science with a cardiovascular health equity lens and to evaluate implementation research that targets cardiovascular inequities. We provide a 4-step roadmap and checklist with critical equity considerations for selecting/adapting evidence-based practices, assessing barriers and facilitators to implementation, selecting/using/adapting implementation strategies, and evaluating implementation success. Informed by our roadmap, we examine several organizational, community, policy, and multisetting interventions and implementation strategies developed to reduce cardiovascular disparities. We highlight gaps in implementation science research to date aimed at achieving cardiovascular health equity, including lack of stakeholder engagement, rigorous mixed methods, and equity-informed theoretical frameworks. We provide several key suggestions, including the need for improved conceptualization and inclusion of social and structural determinants of health in implementation science, and the use of adaptive, hybrid effectiveness designs. In addition, we call for more rigorous examination of multilevel interventions and implementation strategies with the greatest potential for reducing both primary and secondary cardiovascular disparities.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "cardiovascular diseases", "health equity", "implementation science"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Health Equity", "Implementation Science", "American Heart Association", "Healthcare Disparities", "Social Class"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Moise", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Crystal W", "Last Name": "Cen\u00e9", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel G", "Last Name": "Tabak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah R", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine T", "Last Name": "Mills", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Utibe R", "Last Name": "Essien", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cheryl A M", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francisco", "Last Name": "Lopez-Jimenez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Heart Association Council on Epidemiology and Prevention; Council on Hypertension; and Stroke Council", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation", "PubDate": "2022Nov08"}, {"PMID": "35924775", "Title": "Effects of Objective and Perceived Social Isolation on Cardiovascular and Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "Background Social isolation, the relative absence of or infrequency of contact with different types of social relationships, and loneliness (perceived isolation) are associated with adverse health outcomes. Objective To review observational and intervention research that examines the impact of social isolation and loneliness on cardiovascular and brain health and discuss proposed mechanisms for observed associations. Methods We conducted a systematic scoping review of available research. We searched 4 databases, PubMed, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus. Findings Evidence is most consistent for a direct association between social isolation, loneliness, and coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. However, data on the association between social isolation and loneliness with heart failure, dementia, and cognitive impairment are sparse and less robust. Few studies have empirically tested mediating pathways between social isolation, loneliness, and cardiovascular and brain health outcomes using appropriate methods for explanatory analyses. Notably, the effect estimates are small, and there may be unmeasured confounders of the associations. Research in groups that may be at higher risk or more vulnerable to the effects of social isolation is limited. We did not find any intervention studies that sought to reduce the adverse impact of social isolation or loneliness on cardiovascular or brain health outcomes. Conclusions Social isolation and loneliness are common and appear to be independent risk factors for worse cardiovascular and brain health; however, consistency of the associations varies by outcome.

Statin prescription status was extracted from the electronic health record, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between statin prescription and age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other clinical and demographic covariables. In 7,550 patients eligible for primary prevention statin therapy, 3,994 (52.9%) were prescribed statins on at least 1 visit. Statin prescription was highest in patients with diabetes mellitus (73.6%) and with a 10-year ASCVD risk \u226520% (60.6%) and was lowest for those with a 10-year ASCVD risk between 5% and 7.5% (18.7%). Compared with those never prescribed statins, patients prescribed statins were less likely to be women, mainly driven by lower statin prescription rates for women with diabetes. In a fully adjusted model, women remained less likely to be prescribed statin therapy (adjusted odds ratios 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.88). In conclusion, primary prevention statin therapy remains underutilized.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Ambulatory Care", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Drug Prescriptions", "Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prescription Drugs", "Primary Prevention", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gil", "Last Name": "Metser", "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.

Meanwhile, primary care task forces in countries like the United Kingdom and Canada are recommending against depression screening in primary care altogether, citing lack of trials demonstrating improved outcomes in screened vs unscreened patients when the same treatment is available, high false-positive results, and small treatment effects. In this perspective, a primary care physician and two psychiatrists address the question of why we are not making headway in treating common mental health conditions in primary care.

Data regarding moderation of this effect by age and sex are inconsistent, however. We aimed to identify whether age and sex modify the association between depressive symptoms and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Methods and Results The REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White individuals recruited between 2003 and 2007. Associations between time-varying depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale score \u22654 versus <4) and all-cause and CVD mortality were measured using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for demographic and clinical risk factors. All results were stratified by age or sex and by self-reported health status. Of 29\u00a0491 participants, 3253 (11%) had baseline elevated depressive symptoms. Mean age was 65 (9.4) years, with 55.1% of participants female, 41.1% Black, and 46.4% had excellent/very good health. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline, on average 4.9 (SD, 1.5), then 2.1 (SD, 0.4) years later.

Shared decision making (SDM) is recommended prior to initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention but is underutilized. We designed an informatics decision-support tool to facilitate use of the Mayo Clinic Statin Choice decision aid at the point-of-care and evaluated its impact. Methods. Using an iterative approach, we designed and implemented a single-click decision-support tool embedded within the electronic health records (EHRs) to automate the calculation of 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and populate the Statin Choice decision aid. We surveyed primary care providers at two clinics regarding their attitudes about SDM before and after deployment of intervention, as well as their usage of and perceived competence regarding SDM for primary prevention statin therapy. Three-month web traffic to the Statin Choice website was calculated before and after deployment of the intervention. Results. Pre-post surveys were completed by 60 primary care providers (24 [40%] attending physicians and 36 [60%] housestaff physicians). After deployment of the EHR tool, respondents were more aware of the Statin Choice decision aid (P < 0.001), reported being more competent regarding SDM (P = 0.047), and reported using decision aids more often when considering statin initiation (P = 0.043). There was no significant change in attitudes about SDM as measured through the Patient Provider Orientation Scale (pre 4.23 \u00b1 0.40 v. post 4.16 \u00b1 0.38, P = 0.11) and the SDM belief scale (pre 21.4 \u00b1 2.1 v. post 21.1 \u00b1 2.0, P = 0.35). Web-based usage rates for the Statin Choice decision aid increased from 3.4 to 5.2 per 1,000 outpatient clinic visits (P = 0.002). Conclusions. Implementation of a point-of-care decision-support tool increased the usage of decision aids for primary prevention statin therapy.

Top-ranked barriers to ambulatory BP monitoring were challenges in accessing testing, costs of testing, concerns about the willingness or ability of patients to successfully complete tests, and concerns about the accuracy and benefits of testing. Top-ranked barriers to home BP monitoring were concerns about compliance with the correct test protocol, accuracy of tests results, out-of-pocket costs of home BP devices, and time needed to instruct patients on home BP monitoring protocol. Efforts to increase the use of ambulatory and home BP monitoring by primary care providers in the United States should prioritize increasing the financial and personnel resources available for testing and addressing provider concerns about patients' ability to conduct high-quality tests.", "Keywords": ["Implementation science", "guidelines", "prevention"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Female", "Health Expenditures", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Patient Education as Topic", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Primary Health Care", "Time Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Kronish", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Using the CVD Policy Model, CVD events, treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years, and drug and monitoring costs were simulated over 2016 to 2026 for hypertensive patients aged 35 to 74 years. We projected the effectiveness and costs of hypertension treatment according to the 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC)-7 or 2014 JNC8 guidelines, and then for adults aged \u226550 years, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding an intensive goal of systolic blood pressure <120 mm\u2009Hg for patients with CVD, chronic kidney disease, or 10-year CVD risk \u226515%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios <$50\u2009000 per quality-adjusted life years gained were considered cost-effective. JNC7 strategies treat more patients and are more costly to implement compared with JNC8 strategies. Adding intensive systolic blood pressure goals for high-risk patients prevents an estimated 43\u2009000 and 35\u2009000 annual CVD events incremental to JNC8 and JNC7, respectively. Intensive strategies save costs in men and are cost-effective in women compared with JNC8 alone. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50\u2009000 per quality-adjusted life years gained, JNC8+intensive had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in women (82%) and JNC7+intensive the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in men (100%). Assuming higher drug and monitoring costs, adding intensive goals for high-risk patients remained consistently cost-effective in men, but not always in women.
