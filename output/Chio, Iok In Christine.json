We introduce dynamic stable-isotope labeling of organoids (dSILO): a dynamic SILAC derivative that combines a pulse of isotopically labeled amino acids with isobaric tandem mass-tag (TMT) labeling to measure proteome-wide protein turnover rates in organoids. We applied it to a PDA model and discovered that metastatic organoids exhibit an accelerated global proteome turnover compared to primary tumor organoids. Globally, most turnover changes are not reflected at the level of protein abundance. Interestingly, the group of proteins that show the highest turnover increase in metastatic PDA compared to tumor is involved in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that metastatic PDA may adopt alternative respiratory chain functionality that is controlled by the rate at which proteins are turned over. Collectively, our analysis of proteome turnover in PDA organoids offers insights into the mechanisms underlying PDA metastasis.", "Keywords": ["CP: Biotechnology", "CP: Cancer biology", "PDA", "SILAC", "dSILO", "metastases", "protein half-life", "protein turnover", "respirasome"], "MeSH terms": ["Organoids", "Proteome", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Isotope Labeling", "Proteomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison B", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darvesh", "Last Name": "Gorhe", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenny Kim", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie", "Last Name": "Hodapp", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lela", "Last Name": "DeVine", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY 10027, USA; Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karina M", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iok In Christine", "Last Name": "Chio", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

In this study, we focused on Notch4, which had not been investigated in PDAC.

We performed caerulein treatment in both KC and N4 - / - KC mice, and the development of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions were significantly diminished in the N4 - / - KC than in the KC GEMM (P = 0.01). This in vivo result was validated by in vitro ADM induction of the explant cultures of pancreatic acinar cells from the N4 - / - KC and KC mice (P < 0.001), confirming that Notch4 is an important contributor to early pancreatic tumorigenesis. To evaluate the role of Notch4 in the later stage of pancreatic tumorigenesis, we compared the PKC and N4 - / - PKC mice. The N4 - / - PKC mice had better overall survival (P = 0.012) and significantly reduced tumor burden (PanIN: P = 0.018 at 2 months, PDAC: P = 0.039 at 5 months) compared with the PKC GEMM. RNA-sequencing analysis of pancreatic tumor cell lines derived from the PKC and N4 - / - PKC GEMMs revealed that 408 genes were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05) and Pcsk5 is a potential downstream effector of the Notch4 signaling pathway (P < 0.001). Low expression of Pcsk5 positively correlates with good survival in patients with PDAC (P = 0.028).

Here, we report that methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), which can reduce oxidized methionine residues, acts as a suppressor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) metastasis. MSRA expression is decreased in the metastatic tumors of PDA patients, whereas MSRA loss in primary PDA cells promotes migration and invasion. Chemoproteomic profiling of pancreatic organoids revealed that MSRA loss results in the selective oxidation of a methionine residue (M239) in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, M239 oxidation sustains PKM2 in an active tetrameric state to promote respiration, migration, and metastasis, whereas pharmacological activation of PKM2 increases cell migration and metastasis in\u00a0vivo. These results demonstrate that methionine residues can act as reversible redox switches governing distinct signaling outcomes and that the MSRA-PKM2 axis serves as a regulatory nexus between redox biology and cancer metabolism to control tumor metastasis.", "Keywords": ["PKM2", "cancer metabolism", "glucose oxidation", "metastasis", "methionine oxidation", "pancreatic cancer", "redox signaling"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Carrier Proteins", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Methionine", "Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pyruvate Kinase", "Thyroid Hormones", "Thyroid Hormone-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huijin", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Belen", "Last Name": "Sundberg", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiaxing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alec H", "Last Name": "Christian", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Wilkinson", "Affiliation": "University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cian", "Last Name": "Monnin", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Innovation Resource, Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A3, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Daina", "Last Name": "Avizonis", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Innovation Resource, Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A3, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Craig J", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Division of Preclinical Innovation, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20850, USA; Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Kluger", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastrointestinal & Endocrine Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Hollingsworth", "Affiliation": "Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Grandgenett", "Affiliation": "Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelsey A", "Last Name": "Klute", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA."}, {"First Name": "F Dean", "Last Name": "Toste", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.

We found that cultured human CRC cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed when exposed to high levels of vitamin C. This effect is due to increased uptake of the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Increased DHA uptake causes oxidative stress as intracellular DHA is reduced to vitamin C, depleting glutathione. Thus, reactive oxygen species accumulate and inactivate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Inhibition of GAPDH in highly glycolytic KRAS or BRAF mutant cells leads to an energetic crisis and cell death not seen in KRAS and BRAF wild-type cells. High-dose vitamin C impairs tumor growth in Apc/Kras(G12D) mutant mice.

Cooperation between signals of TLR and TNF receptor has been demonstrated through the participation of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR) adaptors in endotoxin tolerance. Here, we identify a TLR2-mediated synergy, through a MyD88-independent crosstalk, which enhances subsequent TNF-mediated nuclear factor-kappa B activation and interleukin-6 induction. Membrane-associated adaptor MAL conduces the link between TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TNFR-associated death domain, leading to a distinctive K63-ubiquitinylated TRAF6 recruitment into TNFR complex. In summary, our results reveal a novel route of TLR signal that synergistically amplifies TNF-mediated responses, indicating an innovative target for inflammation manipulation.", "Keywords": ["TRADD", "TRAF6", "Toll-like receptor", "signalling crosstalk", "tumour necrosis factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "NF-kappa B", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein", "Toll-Like Receptor 2", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu-Ling", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Tzu-Hui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yi-Hsiu", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guann-An", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tzu-Huei", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ping-Hui", "Last Name": "Tseng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shie-Liang", "Last Name": "Hsieh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shu-Ling", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chi-Hung", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chun-Jen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ching-Liang", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iok In Christine", "Last Name": "Chio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tak Wah", "Last Name": "Mak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nien-Jung", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "23699408", "Title": "Mule/Huwe1/Arf-BP1 suppresses Ras-driven tumorigenesis by preventing c-Myc/Miz1-mediated down-regulation of p21 and p15.", "Abstract": "Tumorigenesis results from dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors that influence cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and/or senescence. Many gene products involved in these processes are substrates of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule/Huwe1/Arf-BP1 (Mule), but whether Mule acts as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in vivo remains controversial. We generated K14Cre;Mule(flox/flox(y)) (Mule kKO) mice and subjected them to DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis, which depends on oncogenic Ras signaling. Mule deficiency resulted in increased penetrance, number, and severity of skin tumors, which could be reversed by concomitant genetic knockout of c-Myc but not by knockout of p53 or p19Arf. Notably, in the absence of Mule, c-Myc/Miz1 transcriptional complexes accumulated, and levels of p21CDKN1A (p21) and p15INK4B (p15) were down-regulated. In vitro, Mule-deficient primary keratinocytes exhibited increased proliferation that could be reversed by Miz1 knockdown. Transfer of Mule-deficient transformed cells to nude mice resulted in enhanced tumor growth that again could be abrogated by Miz1 knockdown. Our data demonstrate in vivo that Mule suppresses Ras-mediated tumorigenesis by preventing an accumulation of c-Myc/Miz1 complexes that mediates p21 and p15 down-regulation.", "Keywords": ["Huwe1", "Miz1", "Mule", "Ras", "c-Myc", "p21"], "MeSH terms": ["9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene", "Animals", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Cells, Cultured", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21", "Down-Regulation", "Female", "Genes, ras", "Keratinocytes", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nuclear Proteins", "Oncogene Protein p21(ras)", "Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc", "Signal Transduction", "Skin Neoplasms", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Inoue", "Affiliation": "The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C1, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Zhenyue", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Elia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Cescon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lily", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Silvester", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bryan", "Last Name": "Snow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Isaac S", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masato", "Last Name": "Sasaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wanda Y", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Momoe", "Last Name": "Itsumi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuo", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Ueda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Dominguez-Brauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Gorrini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iok In Christine", "Last Name": "Chio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jillian", "Last Name": "Haight", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Annick", "Last Name": "You-Ten", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "McCracken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Wakeham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Danny", "Last Name": "Ghazarian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Linda J Z", "Last Name": "Penn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerry", "Last Name": "Melino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tak W", "Last Name": "Mak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2013May15"}]
