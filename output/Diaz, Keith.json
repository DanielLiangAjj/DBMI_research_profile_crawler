This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using a single-item smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in lieu of accelerometers in long-term assessment of daily exercise. Data were collected from a randomized controlled trial of intermittently exercising, otherwise healthy adults (N = 79; 57% female, mean age: 31.9 \u00b1 9.5 years) over 365 days. Smartphone-based EMA self-reports of exercise entailed daily end-of-day responses about physical activity; the participants also wore a Fitbit device to measure physical activity. The Kappa statistic was used to quantify the agreement between accelerometer-determined (24 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] within 30 min) and self-reported exercise. Possible demographic predictors of agreement were assessed. Participants provided an average of 164 \u00b1 87 days of complete data. The average within-person Kappa was \u03ba = 0.30 \u00b1 0.22 (range: -0.15-0.73). Mean Kappa ranged from 0.16 to 0.30 when the accelerometer-based definition of an exercise bout varied in duration from 15 to 30 min of MVPA within any 30 min period. Among the correlates examined, sex was significantly associated with agreement; mean agreement was higher among women (\u03ba = 0.37) than men (\u03ba = 0.20).

This study investigated associations between sedentary bout variables and metabolic health markers in the Hispanic Community Health Study/SOL Youth (Study of Latino Youth). Methods and Results SOL Youth was a population-based cohort of 1466 youth (age range, 8-16\u2009years; 48.5% female); 957 youth were included in the analytic sample based on complete data. Accelerometers measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total sedentary time, and sedentary bout patterns (daily time spent in sedentary bouts \u226530\u2009minutes, median sedentary bout duration, and number of daily breaks from sedentary time). Clinical measures included body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. After adjusting for sociodemographics, total sedentary time, and MVPA, longer median bout durations and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a greater body mass index percentile (bbouts=0.09 and bbreaks=-0.18), waist circumference (bbouts=0.12 and bbreaks=-0.20), and fasting insulin (bbouts=0.09 and bbreaks=-0.21). Fewer breaks were also associated with a greater homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (b=-0.21). More time in bouts lasting \u226530\u2009minutes was associated with a greater fasting glucose (b=0.18) and glycated hemoglobin (b=0.19). Conclusions Greater accumulation of sedentary time in prolonged and uninterrupted bouts had adverse associations with adiposity and glycemic control over and above total sedentary time and MVPA.

Subsequently, the interdisciplinary team created recommendations for clinicians, public health agencies, medical organizations, federal agencies, and other stakeholders involved with administering prenatal screening and testing to create better patient experiences; conduct training for healthcare professionals; create, enforce, and fund policies and guidelines; and engage in more robust data collection and research efforts.", "Keywords": ["Developmental disability", "Genetic testing", "Intellectual disability", "Prenatal diagnosis", "Prenatal screening"], "MeSH terms": ["Pregnancy", "Female", "Humans", "Disabled Persons", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Health Personnel", "Public Health", "Patient Outcome Assessment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Meredith", "Affiliation": "Human Development Institute, University of Kentucky, USA.

We are motivated by a behavioral intervention trial where we introduce sedentary breaks to subjects with a goal to reduce their glucose level monitored over 8 hours. Each sedentary break regimen is defined by two elements: break frequency and break duration. The trial aims to identify minimum combinations of frequency and duration that shift mean glucose, that is, the minimum effective dose (MED) combinations. The means of glucose reduction associated with the dose combinations are only partially ordered. To circumvent constrained estimation due to partial ordering, we propose estimating the MED by maximizing a weighted product of combinationwise posterior gains. The estimation adopts an asymmetric gain function, indexed by a decision parameter \u03f5, which defines the relative gains of a true negative decision and a true positive decision. We also introduce an adaptive \u03f5-tapering algorithm to be used in conjunction with the estimation method. Simulation studies show that using asymmetric gain with a carefully chosen \u03f5 is critical to keeping false discoveries low, while \u03f5-tapering adds to the probability of identifying truly effective doses (i.e., true positives). Under an ensemble of scenarios for the sedentary break study, \u03f5-tapering yields consistently high true positive rates across scenarios and achieves about 90% true positive rate, compared to 68% by a nonadaptive design with comparable false discovery rate.", "Keywords": ["Adaptive dose-finding", "generalized PIPE", "glucose monitoring", "sedentary breaks", "weighted posterior gain"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying Kuen", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Thevaa", "Last Name": "Chandereng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Keith M", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "The annals of applied statistics", "PubDate": "2022Sep"}, {"PMID": "35797548", "Title": "Sedentary Behavior and Physical Functioning in Middle-Age and Older Adults Living in the United States: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study.", "Abstract": "Sedentary behavior is associated with poor physical function in older adults, which can lead to accelerated skeletal muscle aging (sarcopenia) and premature mortality.

Using ecological momentary assessment, we tested whether usual exercise level moderates the relationship of self-reported anxiety to concurrent ambulatory heart rate (HR) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP). Participants (N\u2009=\u2009832) completed 24-h ambulatory monitoring of HR/BP, using a brachial BP cuff that took readings at 28-min intervals. Anxiety levels were concurrently reported on a visual analog scale (VAS) using a Palm Pilot. Usual exercise behavior was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. Random coefficients linear regression models predicting momentary HR/BP readings from time-matched anxiety scores were estimated, yielding the average within-person effect (slope) of anxiety. The interaction of exercise level (i.e., no weekly exercise, 1-149, and \u2265\u2009150\u00a0min/week; a between-person factor) with anxiety was added to the model in order to estimate the average anxiety slope for participants in each exercise category. The relationship of HR/BP to anxiety did not differ significantly among exercise categories, hence not providing evidence for the cross-stressor hypothesis. In an exploratory analysis of the difference in HR/BP between occasions when anxiety was in the top versus bottom person-specific quintiles of responses, the difference in HR (but not SBP or DBP) varied significantly by exercise level (F(2,625)\u2009=\u20094.92, p\u2009=\u20090.008).

Compared with participants without iLVM, participants with iLVM had a higher rate of CVD events and all-cause mortality. After multivariable adjustment, including for the presence of LVH, iLVM was associated with an increased risk of CVD events (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.62). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.98-1.70). Among participants without and with LVH, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of iLVM for CVD events were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.68-3.81) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.74-2.00), respectively (Pinteraction=0.029); and for all-cause mortality, the hazard ratios were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.81-1.89) and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.86-1.85), respectively (Pinteraction=0.664).

Few data exist on the sedentary behavior patterns of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results We characterized patterns of sedentary time and their correlates in 149 patients with acute coronary syndrome over the first month postdischarge, a critical period when lifestyle behaviors are formed. Sedentary time was measured by accelerometry for 28 days postdischarge. Group-based modeling at the day level was used to characterize sedentary patterns. Participants spent a mean of 9.7\u00b12.0\u00a0hours per day sedentary during the 28 days postdischarge, with significant decreases in sedentary time observed in each consecutive week (P<0.01 for all). Three distinct sedentary patterns were identified: high (20.6% of participants), moderate (47.9%), and low (31.5%). The high and moderate sedentary groups spent a mean of 12.6\u00b10.8 and 10.0\u00b10.7\u00a0hours per day sedentary, respectively, and had only minimal decreases in their sedentary time (<3\u00a0minutes per day) over the 28 days. The low sedentary group spent a mean of 7.3\u00b10.8\u00a0hours per day sedentary, with a rapid decrease in sedentary time (14\u00a0minutes per day) observed during the first week postdischarge followed by a relatively smaller decrease (\u22485\u00a0minutes per day) that persisted until day 21 postdischarge. Non-Hispanic ethnicity, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, lower physical health-related quality of life, and not having a partner were associated with an increased likelihood of being in the high sedentary group. Conclusions Survivors of acute coronary syndrome accrued high volumes of sedentary time during the first month postdischarge, with most showing little change over time.

The purpose of this study was to compare the association of both television viewing and occupational sitting with CVD events and all-cause mortality in blacks. Methods and Results Participants included 3592 individuals enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based study of blacks residing in Jackson, Mississippi. Television viewing (<2, 2-4, and >4\u00a0h/day) and occupational sitting (never/seldom, sometimes, often/always) were self-reported. Over a median follow-up of 8.4\u00a0years, there were 129 CVD events and 205 deaths. The highest category of television viewing (>4\u00a0h/day) was associated with a greater risk for a composite CVD events/all-cause mortality end point compared with the lowest category (<2\u00a0h/day; hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI , 1.13-1.97). In contrast, the highest category of occupational sitting (often/always) was not associated with risk for a composite CVD events/all-cause mortality end point compared with the lowest category (never/seldom; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI , 0.69-1.18). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity moderated the association of television viewing with CVD events/all-cause mortality such that television viewing was not associated with greater risk among those with high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels.

We determined the association between cardiovascular health and incident hypertension in JHS (the Jackson Heart Study)-a cohort of blacks. We analyzed participants without hypertension or cardiovascular disease at baseline (2000-2004) who attended \u22651 follow-up visit in 2005 to 2008 or 2009 to 2012 (n=1878). Body mass index, physical activity, diet, cigarette smoking, blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol, and fasting glucose were assessed at baseline and categorized as ideal, intermediate, or poor using the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 definitions. Incident hypertension was defined at the first visit wherein a participant had systolic BP \u2265140 mm Hg, diastolic BP \u226590 mm Hg, or self-reported taking antihypertensive medication. The percentage of participants with \u22641, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 ideal Life's Simple 7 components was 6.5%, 22.4%, 34.4%, 25.2%, 10.0%, and 1.4%, respectively. No participants had 7 ideal components. During follow-up (median, 8.0 years), 944 (50.3%) participants developed hypertension, including 81.3% with \u22641 and 11.1% with 6 ideal components. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for incident hypertension comparing participants with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 versus \u22641 ideal component were 0.80 (0.61-1.03), 0.58 (0.45-0.74), 0.30 (0.23-0.40), 0.26 (0.18-0.37), and 0.10 (0.03-0.31), respectively (Ptrend <0.001). This association was present among participants with baseline systolic BP <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP <80 mm Hg and separately systolic BP 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg.

Overall physical activity, moderate-vigorous physical activity, and domain-specific physical activity (work, active living, household, and sport/exercise) were assessed by self-report during the baseline examination (2000-2004).

Risk factor management is complicated by polypharmacy-related adverse events. Aims To characterize the impact of physical inactivity for stroke by age in a multi-ethnic prospective cohort study (NOMAS, n\u2009=\u20093298). Methods Leisure time physical activity was assessed by a validated questionnaire and our primary exposure was physical inactivity (PI). Participants were followed annually for incident stroke. We fit Cox-proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (HR 95% CI) for the association of PI and other risk factors with risk of stroke including two-way interaction terms between the primary exposures and age (<80 vs.\u2009\u226580). Results The mean age was 69\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 years and 562 (17%) were\u2009\u226580 at enrolment. PI was common in the cohort (40.8%). Over a median of 14 years, we found 391 strokes. We found a significant interaction of age\u2009\u226580 on the risk of stroke with PI ( p\u2009=\u20090.03). In stratified models, PI versus any activity (adjusted HR 1.60, 95%CI 1.05-2.42) was associated with an increased risk of stroke among those\u2009\u226580.

We used the Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index (AASI), which reflects this ventricular-vascular interaction, in untreated individuals with prehypertension and Stage 1 hypertension to evaluate two different measures of BP variability using the brachial pulse pressure (PP) obtained over 24\u00a0hours. We enrolled 64 untreated adults with systolic BP between 130-159\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg and diastolic values of <100\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg who underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring with calculation of 24-hour AASIs. Variability in brachial PP was determined using the standard deviation of the measurements over 24\u00a0hours and the average real variability.

Physical activity is commonly recommended as an important lifestyle modification that may aid in the prevention of hypertension. Recent epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated a consistent, temporal, and dose-dependent relationship between physical activity and the development of hypertension. Experimental evidence from interventional studies has further confirmed a relationship between physical activity and hypertension as the favorable effects of exercise on blood pressure reduction have been well characterized in recent years. Despite the available evidence strongly supporting a role for physical activity in the prevention of hypertension, many unanswered questions regarding the protective benefits of physical activity in high-risk individuals, the factors that may moderate the relationship between physical activity and hypertension, and the optimal prescription for hypertension prevention remain.
