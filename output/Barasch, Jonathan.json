[{"PMID": "38632381", "Title": "Epithelial cell states associated with kidney and allograft injury.", "Abstract": "The kidney epithelium, with its intricate arrangement of highly specialized cell types, constitutes the functional core of the organ. Loss of kidney epithelium is linked to the loss of functional nephrons and a subsequent decline in kidney function. In kidney transplantation, epithelial injury signatures observed during post-transplantation surveillance are strong predictors of adverse kidney allograft outcomes. However, epithelial injury is currently neither monitored clinically nor addressed therapeutically after kidney transplantation. Several factors can contribute to allograft epithelial injury, including allograft rejection, drug toxicity, recurrent infections and postrenal obstruction. The injury mechanisms that underlie allograft injury overlap partially with those associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the native kidney. Studies using advanced transcriptomic analyses of single cells from kidney or urine have identified a role for kidney injury-induced epithelial cell states in exacerbating and sustaining damage in AKI and CKD. These epithelial cell states and their associated expression signatures are also observed in transplanted kidney allografts, suggesting that the identification and characterization of transcriptomic epithelial cell states in kidney allografts may have potential clinical implications for diagnosis and therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Kidney Transplantation", "Humans", "Epithelial Cells", "Acute Kidney Injury", "Allografts", "Graft Rejection", "Kidney", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Hinze", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Svjetlana", "Last Name": "Lovric", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philip F", "Last Name": "Halloran", "Affiliation": "Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kai M", "Last Name": "Schmidt-Ott", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

Conversely, Tfcp2l1 blunts the proliferative response to inflammatory signaling during the early acute injury phase. Tfcp2l1 temporally regulates AT2 self-renewal and differentiation in alveolar regions undergoing active regeneration. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing reveal that Tfcp2l1 regulates cell fate dynamics across the AT2-AT1 differentiation and restricts the inflammatory program in murine AT2 cells.

Yet serum creatinine (sCr) is a marker of both functional and pathological processes and does not adequately assay tubular injury. In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created mice expressing Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Uprt) and inoculated 4-thiouracil (4-TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven 4-TU-tagged RNA was isolated from intact kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs in collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Even lineage-related cell types expressed different genes in response to the 2 stressors. TU tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus, nascent RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, 4-TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Mice", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tian Huai", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Stauber", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Jacunski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neal", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miriam", "Last Name": "Callahan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Run", "Last Name": "Banlengchit", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Abraham D", "Last Name": "Levitman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Desanti De Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Madeleine S", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Edwin", "Last Name": "Mathieu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qingyin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Yuanji", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Tejashree", "Last Name": "Gopal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel", "Last Name": "Askanase", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Siddarth", "Last Name": "Arumugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob S", "Last Name": "Stevens", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Samuel K", "Last Name": "Sia", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2022Mar22"}, {"PMID": "34780258", "Title": "Innate Bacteriostatic Mechanisms Defend the Urinary Tract.", "Abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common type of urogenital disease.

While iron deficiency is known to suppress embryonic organogenesis, its effect on the adult organ in the context of clinically relevant damage has not been considered. Here we report that iron deficiency is a risk factor for nephrotoxic intrinsic acute kidney injury of the nephron (iAKI). Iron deficiency exacerbated cisplatin-induced iAKI by markedly increasing non-heme catalytic iron and Nox4 protein which together catalyze production of hydroxyl radicals followed by protein and DNA oxidation, apoptosis and ferroptosis. Crosstalk between non-heme catalytic iron/Nox4 and downstream oxidative damage generated a mutual amplification cycle that facilitated rapid progression of cisplatin-induced iAKI. Iron deficiency also exacerbated a second model of iAKI, rhabdomyolysis, via increasing catalytic heme-iron. Heme-iron induced lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation by interacting with Nox4-independent mechanisms, promoting p53/p21 activity and cellular senescence.

Mechanistic characterization of CKD and AKI in patients may facilitate a precision-medicine approach to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project aims to ethically and safely obtain kidney biopsies from participants with CKD or AKI, create a reference kidney atlas, and characterize disease subgroups to stratify patients based on molecular features of disease, clinical characteristics, and associated outcomes. An additional aim is to identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies and preventive strategies. This project is a multicenter prospective cohort study of adults with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy for research purposes. This investigation focuses on kidney diseases that are most prevalent and therefore substantially burden the public health, including CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension and AKI attributed to ischemic and toxic injuries. Reference kidney tissues (for example, living-donor kidney biopsies) will also be evaluated. Traditional and digital pathology will be combined with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis of the kidney tissue as well as deep clinical phenotyping for supervised and unsupervised subgroup analysis and systems biology analysis. Participants will be followed prospectively for 10 years to ascertain clinical outcomes. Cell types, locations, and functions will be characterized in health and disease in an open, searchable, online kidney tissue atlas. All data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project will be made readily available for broad use by scientists, clinicians, and patients.", "Keywords": ["acute kidney injury", "chronic kidney disease", "diabetes", "hypertension", "precision medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Adult", "Humans", "Kidney", "Precision Medicine", "Prospective Studies", "Proteomics", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian H", "Last Name": "de Boer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Prostatic inflammation is associated with prostatic collagen accumulation and both are linked to progressive lower urinary tract symptoms in men. We characterized a model of prostatic inflammation using transurethral instillations of Escherichia coli UTI89 in C57BL/6J male mice with the goal of determining the optimal instillation conditions, understanding the impact of instillation conditions on urinary physiology, and identifying ideal prostatic lobes and collagen 1a1 prostatic cell types for further analysis. The smallest instillation volume tested (50 \u00b5L) distributed exclusively to the bladder, 100- and 200-\u00b5L volumes distributed to the bladder and prostate, and a 500-\u00b5L volume distributed to the bladder, prostate, and ureter. A threshold optical density of 0.4 E. coli UTI89 in the instillation fluid was necessary for significant (P < 0.05) prostate colonization. E. coli UTI89 infection resulted in a low frequency, high volume spontaneous voiding pattern. This phenotype was due to exposure to E. coli UTI89, not catheterization alone, and was minimally altered by a 50-\u00b5L increase in instillation volume and doubling of E. coli concentration. Prostate inflammation was isolated to the dorsal prostate and was accompanied by increased collagen density. This was partnered with increased density of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C+, procollagen type I-\u03b11+ copositive cells and decreased density of \u03b12-smooth muscle actin+, procollagen type I-\u03b11+ copositive cells.

Two nuclear-encoded vertebrate mitochondrial high-affinity iron importers, mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1) and Mfrn2, have been identified in mammals. In mice, the gene encoding Mfrn1, solute carrier family 25 member 37 (Slc25a37), is highly expressed in sites of erythropoiesis, and whole-body Slc25a37 deletion leads to lethality. Here, we report that mice with a deletion of Slc25a28 (encoding Mfrn2) are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but show decreased male fertility due to reduced sperm numbers and sperm motility. Mfrn2-/- mice placed on a low-iron diet exhibited reduced mitochondrial manganese, cobalt, and zinc levels, but not reduced iron. Hepatocyte-specific loss of Slc25a37 (encoding Mfrn1) in Mfrn2-/- mice did not affect animal viability, but resulted in a 40% reduction in mitochondrial iron and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Placing animals on a low-iron diet exaggerated the reduction in mitochondrial iron observed in liver-specific Mfrn1/2-knockout animals. Mfrn1-/-/Mfrn2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages or skin fibroblasts in vitro were unable to proliferate, and overexpression of Mfrn1-GFP or Mfrn2-GFP prevented this proliferation defect. Loss of both mitoferrins in hepatocytes dramatically reduced regeneration in the adult mouse liver, further supporting the notion that both mitoferrins transport iron and that their absence limits proliferative capacity of mammalian cells. We conclude that Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 contribute to mitochondrial iron homeostasis and are required for high-affinity iron import during active proliferation of mammalian cells.", "Keywords": ["Slc25a28", "cell proliferation", "gene knockout", "iron metabolism", "liver", "membrane transport", "metal homeostasis", "mitochondria", "mitoferrin (Mfrn)", "solute carrier family 25 member 37 (Slc25a37)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cell Proliferation", "Homeostasis", "Iron", "Liver Regeneration", "Male", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitochondria, Liver"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Seguin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubree M", "Last Name": "Earl", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liangtao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared", "Last Name": "Wallace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andong", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rishna", "Last Name": "Shrestha", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marie-B\u00e9reng\u00e8re", "Last Name": "Troadec", "Affiliation": "University Brest, Inserm, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, F-29200, Brest, France."}, {"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "Hockin", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Titen", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dave E", "Last Name": "Warner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "P Tom", "Last Name": "Dowdle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin E", "Last Name": "Wohlfahrt", "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Hillas", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Firpo", "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Jerry", "Last Name": "Kaplan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry H", "Last Name": "Paw", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diane M", "Last Name": "Ward", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA diane.mcveyward@path.utah.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2020Aug07"}, {"PMID": "31793908", "Title": "Not all proteinuria is created equal.", "Abstract": "Albuminuria acts as a marker of progressive chronic kidney disease and as an indicator for initiation of hypertension treatment via modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Here, we combine renal cell-specific luciferase reporter mice using a chemoselective luciferin to guide the acquisition of cell-specific transcriptional changes in C57BL/6 background mice. Hydrogen peroxide generation, a common mechanism of tissue damage, was tracked using a peroxy-caged-luciferin to identify optimum time points for immunoprecipitation of labeled ribosomes for RNA-sequencing. Together, these tools revealed a profound impact of AKI on mitochondrial pathways in the collecting duct. In fact, targeting the mitochondria with an antioxidant, ameliorated not only hydrogen peroxide generation, but also significantly reduced oxidative stress and the expression of the AKI biomarker, LCN2. This integrative approach of coupling physiological imaging with transcriptomics and drug testing revealed how the collecting duct responds to AKI and opens new venues for cell-specific predictive monitoring and treatment.", "Keywords": ["Bioluminescence imaging", "Gene expression analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Antioxidants", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Ischemia", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nephrons", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Reperfusion Injury", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Miyazaki", "Affiliation": "1Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."}, {"First Name": "Sina A", "Last Name": "Gharib", "Affiliation": "3Computational Medicine Core, Center for Lung Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."}, {"First Name": "Yun-Wei A", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "1Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "4Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavlo", "Last Name": "Khodakivskyi", "Affiliation": "5Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Akio", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "1Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "Lawrence Livermore Labs, Livermore, CA 94550 USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander D", "Last Name": "Klose", "Affiliation": "7InVivo Analytics, Inc., New York, NY 10023 USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin P", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "8PerkinElmer, Inc., Hopkinton, MA 01748 USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Dubikovskaya", "Affiliation": "5Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Patrick S", "Last Name": "Page-McCaw", "Affiliation": "9Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232 USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "4Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Neal", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "1Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."}], "Journal": "Communications biology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31445577", "Title": "Urinary defense begins in the kidney.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Lcn2 (NGAL)", "RNase4", "RNase7", "UTI", "diabetes", "insulin", "intercalated cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Kidney", "Lipocalins", "Receptor, Insulin", "Urinary Tract"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abraham", "Last Name": "Levitman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuanji", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mendel", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.

Fortunately, myriad new tools have now been developed to better understand the relationship between acute tubular injury and elevation in serum creatinine (SCr). These tools include unbiased gene and protein expression analyses in kidney, urine and blood, the localization of specific gene transcripts in pathological biopsy samples by rapid in-situ RNA technology and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses. However, this molecular approach to AKI has produced a series of unexpected problems, because the expression of specific kidney-derived molecules that are indicative of injury often do not correlate with SCr levels. This discrepancy between kidney injury markers and SCr level can be reconciled by the recognition that many separate subtypes of AKI exist, each with distinct patterning of molecular markers of tubular injury and SCr data. In this Review, we describe the weaknesses of isolated SCr-based diagnoses, the clinical and molecular subtyping of acute tubular injury, and the role of non-invasive biomarkers in clinical phenotyping.

Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs.

However, it remains debated whether ferroportin (FPN), the only known iron exporter, is functionally involved in renal iron recycling and whether renal iron recycling is required for systemic iron homeostasis. We deleted FPN in whole nephrons by use of a Nestin-Cre and in the distal nephrons and collecting ducts, using a Ksp-Cre, and investigated its impacts on renal iron recycling and systemic iron homeostasis. FPN deletion by Nestin-Cre, but not by Ksp-Cre, caused excess iron retention and increased ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) specifically in the proximal tubules and resulted in the reduction of serum and hepatic iron. The systemic iron redistribution was aggravated, resulting in anemia and the marked downregulation of hepatic hepcidin in elderly FPN knockout (KO)/Nestin-Cre mice. Similarly, in iron-deficient FPN KO/Nestin-Cre mice, the renal iron retention worsened anemia with the activation of the erythropoietin-erythroferrone-hepcidin pathway and the downregulation of hepatic hepcidin. Hence, FPN likely located at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubules to export iron into the circulation and was required for renal iron recycling and systemic iron homeostasis particularly in elderly and iron-deficient mice. Moreover, FPN deletion in the proximal tubules alleviated ischemic acute kidney injury, possibly by upregulating FTH1 to limit catalytic iron and by priming antioxidant mechanisms, indicating that FPN could be deleterious in the pathophysiology of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and thus may be a potential target for the prevention and mitigation of ischemic AKI.", "Keywords": ["acute kidney injury", "ferroportin", "iron reabsorption", "ischemia/reperfusion"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Hepcidins", "Homeostasis", "Iron", "Ischemia", "Kidney", "Kidney Tubules, Proximal", "Liver", "Mice, Transgenic", "Spleen"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xueqiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Technology, Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Tongji University , Shanghai , China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqing", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Technology, Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Tongji University , Shanghai , China."}, {"First Name": "Juanlian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Technology, Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Tongji University , Shanghai , China."}, {"First Name": "Shifeng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Technology, Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Tongji University , Shanghai , China."}, {"First Name": "Zhigang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou , China."}, {"First Name": "Fudi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Nutrition Discovery Innovation Center, Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, School of Public Health, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China."}, {"First Name": "Wenjun", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Kidney Transplantation, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou , China."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andong", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Technology, Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Tongji University , Shanghai , China."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Tfcp2l1 induces the expression of IC specific genes, including specific H+-ATPase subunits and Jag1. Jag1 in turn, initiates Notch signaling in PCs but inhibits Notch signaling in ICs. Tfcp2l1 inactivation deletes ICs, whereas Jag1 inactivation results in the forfeiture of discrete IC and PC identities.

Rehospitalizations for recurrent congestion portend poor outcomes independently of age and renal function. Persistent congestion trumps serum creatinine increases in predicting adverse heart failure outcomes. No decongestive pharmacological therapy has reduced these harmful consequences. Simplified ultrafiltration devices permit fluid removal in lower-acuity hospital settings, but with conflicting results regarding safety and efficacy. Ultrafiltration performed at fixed rates after onset of therapy-induced increased serum creatinine was not superior to standard care and resulted in more complications. In contrast, compared with diuretic agents, some data suggest that adjustment of ultrafiltration rates to patients' vital signs and renal function may be associated with more effective decongestion and fewer heart failure events. Essential aspects of ultrafiltration remain poorly defined. Further research is urgently needed, given the burden of congestion and data suggesting sustained benefits of early and adjustable ultrafiltration.", "Keywords": ["biomarkers", "creatinine", "diuretics", "glomerular filtration rate", "venous congestion"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Volume", "Diuretics", "Heart Failure", "Hemofiltration", "Humans", "Pilot Projects", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria Rosa", "Last Name": "Costanzo", "Affiliation": "Advocate Heart Institute, Naperville, Illinois.

These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine function of bone.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Appetite Regulation", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Bone and Bones", "Cyclic AMP", "Eating", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factor-23",

In fact, whether decreased excretory function due to contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (vAKI) or due to intrinsic kidney injury (iAKI) actually share pathogenesis and should be aggregated in the same diagnostic group remains an open question. To examine this possibility, we created mouse models of iAKI and vAKI that induced a similar increase in serum creatinine concentration. Using laser microdissection to isolate specific domains of the kidney, followed by RNA sequencing, we found that thousands of genes responded specifically to iAKI or to vAKI, but very few responded to both stimuli. In fact, the activated gene sets comprised different, functionally unrelated signal transduction pathways and were expressed in different regions of the kidney. Moreover, we identified distinctive gene expression patterns in human urine as potential biomarkers of either iAKI or vAKI, but not both.

Unfortunately, therapeutic iron chelators also have undesired toxicity and may deliver iron to microbes. Here we show that a mutant form (K3Cys) of endogenous lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is filtered by the kidney but can bypass sites of megalin-dependent recapture, resulting in urinary excretion. Because K3Cys maintains recognition of its cognate ligand, the iron siderophore enterochelin, this protein can capture and transport iron even in the acidic conditions of urine. Mutant LCN2 strips iron from transferrin and citrate, and delivers it into the urine. In addition, it removes iron from iron overloaded mice, including models of acquired (iron-dextran or stored red blood cells) and primary (Hfe-/-) iron overload. In each case, the mutants reduce redox activity typical of non-transferrin-bound iron.

ligands that bind the protein Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL, Siderocalin, Lipocalin-2) have helped to elucidate its function. NGAL-Siderocalin binds and sequesters the iron loaded bacterial siderophore enterochelin (Ent), defining the protein as an innate immune effector. Simple metabolic catechols can also form tight complexes with NGAL-Siderocalin and ferric iron, suggesting that the protein may act as an iron scavenger even in the absence of Ent. While different catechols have been detected in human urine, they have not been directly purified from a biofluid and demonstrated to ligate iron with NGAL-Siderocalin. This paper describes a \"natural products\" approach to identify small molecules that mediate iron binding to NGAL-Siderocalin. A 10K filtrate of human urine was subjected to multiple steps of column chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, guided by NGAL-Siderocalin-iron binding assays and LC-MS detection. The co-factor forming a ternary structure with iron and NGAL-Siderocalin was identified as authentic simple catechol (dihydroxybenze) by ESI-HR-Mass, UV, and NMR spectrometric analysis. Comparison of the binding strengths of different catechols demonstrated that the vicinal-dihydroxyl groups were the key functional groups and that steric compatibilities of the catechol ring have the strongest effect on binding. Although catechol was a known NGAL-Siderocalin co-factor, our purification directly confirmed its presence in urine as well as its capacity to serve as an iron trap with NGAL-Siderocalin.", "Keywords": ["Binding", "Catechol", "Enterochelin", "Ferric Iron", "Lipocalin-2", "NGAL", "Purification", "Siderocalin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guan-Hu", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Anhui Agricultural University, 130 West Changjiang Road, Hefei, Anhui Province, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, 630 West 168 St, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Anhui Agricultural University, 130 West Changjiang Road, Hefei, Anhui Province, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Anhui Agricultural University, 130 West Changjiang Road, Hefei, Anhui Province, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng-Lin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Anhui Agricultural University, 130 West Changjiang Road, Hefei, Anhui Province, 230036, China."}, {"First Name": "Shi-Xian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, 630 West 168 St, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "RSC advances", "PubDate": "2015Jan01"}, {"PMID": "25806716", "Title": "Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin: potential biomarker for late-onset sepsis.", "Abstract": "To assess the ability of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (UNGAL) to discriminate between culture-positive vs. culture-negative late-onset sepsis evaluations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Acute-Phase Proteins", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care, Neonatal", "Lipocalin-2", "Lipocalins", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sepsis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Pynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook University School of Medicine, Stony Brook, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elvira", "Last Name": "Parravicini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Saiman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan M", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Lorenz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Pediatric research", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "25758223", "Title": "A Grhl2-dependent gene network controls trophoblast branching morphogenesis.", "Abstract": "Healthy placental development is essential for reproductive success; failure of the feto-maternal interface results in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. We found that grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), a CP2-type transcription factor, is highly expressed in chorionic trophoblast cells, including basal chorionic trophoblast (BCT) cells located at the chorioallantoic interface in murine placentas. Placentas from Grhl2-deficient mouse embryos displayed defects in BCT cell polarity and basement membrane integrity at the chorioallantoic interface, as well as a severe disruption of labyrinth branching morphogenesis. Selective Grhl2 inactivation only in epiblast-derived cells rescued all placental defects but phenocopied intraembryonic defects observed in global Grhl2 deficiency, implying the importance of Grhl2 activity in trophectoderm-derived cells. ChIP-seq identified 5282 GRHL2 binding sites in placental tissue. By integrating these data with placental gene expression profiles, we identified direct and indirect Grhl2 targets and found a marked enrichment of GRHL2 binding adjacent to genes downregulated in Grhl2(-/-) placentas, which encoded known regulators of placental development and epithelial morphogenesis. These genes included that encoding the serine protease inhibitor Kunitz type 1 (Spint1), which regulates BCT cell integrity and labyrinth formation. In human placenta, we found that human orthologs of murine GRHL2 and its targets displayed co-regulation and were expressed in trophoblast cells in a similar domain as in mouse placenta. Our data indicate that a conserved Grhl2-coordinated gene network controls trophoblast branching morphogenesis, thereby facilitating development of the site of feto-maternal exchange.

Lipocalin.", "Abstract": "Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), was originally identified in neutrophil granules as a heterodimer complex with gelatinase B (matrix metalloproteinase 9, MMP9), but more recently has been found to be secreted by damaged epithelial cells. Ngal is a member of the lipocalin family and subsequently named as lipocalin 2 on the basis of structural similarity with other members of the lipocalin family and its potential association with hydrophobic retinol and cholesterol oleate more strongly than their hydrophilic counterparts. In 2002, a landmark paper suggested that Ngal is a bacteriostatic agent which blocks iron acquisition by interacting with a number of bacterial siderophores, especially enterobactin. Since then, more siderophore-carrying functions have been reported than the possibility of hydrophobic ligand transport. In this setting, Ngal was renamed Siderocalin. Functions of siderocalin include not only bacteriostatic activity but potentially as a mediator of cell growth and differentiation; some of these functions appear to be referable to the holo siderocalin:siderophore:iron complex and recent work suggests that metabolic products may act as mammalian siderophores bound by Ngal. While still speculative, it may be that the mammalian siderophores can establish the missing link between Ngal and a number of its functions in vivo. This review provides an overview of the discoveries of the different ligands of Ngal and consequently related functions. Hydrophobic ligands, bacterial siderophores as well as their modified structures (synthetic siderophores), and mammalian siderophores are summarized.", "Keywords": ["Ngal", "bacteriostatic", "ligand", "lipocalin-2", "mammalian", "siderocalin", "siderophore"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guan-Hu", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilization, Biotechnology Building 214, Anhui Agricultural University, China."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Tang", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilization, Biotechnology Building 214, Anhui Agricultural University, China; Department of Food Science, Rutgers University, 65 Dudley Road, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901-8520, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "RSC advances", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "24937428", "Title": "\u03b1-Intercalated cells defend the urinary system from bacterial infection.", "Abstract": "\u03b1-Intercalated cells (A-ICs) within the collecting duct of the kidney are critical for acid-base homeostasis. Here, we have shown that A-ICs also serve as both sentinels and effectors in the defense against urinary infections. In a murine urinary tract infection model, A-ICs bound uropathogenic E. coli and responded by acidifying the urine and secreting the bacteriostatic protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2; also known as NGAL). A-IC-dependent LCN2 secretion required TLR4, as mice expressing an LPS-insensitive form of TLR4 expressed reduced levels of LCN2. The presence of LCN2 in urine was both necessary and sufficient to control the urinary tract infection through iron sequestration, even in the harsh condition of urine acidification. In mice lacking A-ICs, both urinary LCN2 and urinary acidification were reduced, and consequently bacterial clearance was limited. Together these results indicate that A-ICs, which are known to regulate acid-base metabolism, are also critical for urinary defense against pathogenic bacteria. They respond to both cystitis and pyelonephritis by delivering bacteriostatic chemical agents to the lower urinary system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acid-Base Equilibrium", "Acute-Phase Proteins", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Escherichia coli Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Iron", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting", "Lipocalin-2", "Lipocalins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Toll-Like Receptor 4", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neal", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ritwij", "Last Name": "Kulkarni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Max", "Last Name": "Werth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kai M", "Last Name": "Schmidt-Ott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Forster", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qingyin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eugenia", "Last Name": "Singer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander D", "Last Name": "Klose", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tian Huai", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin P", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sunetra", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Soundarapandian", "Last Name": "Vijayakumar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Seward", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "Bovino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yared", "Last Name": "Takabe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "F\u00e1bio E", "Last Name": "Amaral", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Wax", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kaitlyn", "Last Name": "Corbin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kiyoshi", "Last Name": "Mori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lynne", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Nickolas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vivette", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andong", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24599361", "Title": "An AKI biomarker lipocalin 2 in the blood derives from the kidney in renal injury but from neutrophils in normal and infected conditions.", "Abstract": "Lipocalin 2 (LCN2 or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) is a secretory protein discovered from neutrophils, which accumulates in the blood and urine during acute kidney injury (AKI) and in the blood by bacterial infection.

The imbalance of iron and ROS may eventually cause tissue damage such as renal proximal tubule injury and necrosis. Many approaches were exploited to ameliorate the oxidative stress caused by the imbalance. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the most active and most abundant catechin in tea, was found to be involved in the protection of a spectrum of renal injuries caused by oxidative stress. Most of studies suggested that EGCG works as an antioxidant. In this paper, Multivariate analysis of the LC-MS data of tea extracts and binding assays showed that the tea polyphenol EGCG can form stable complex with iron through the protein Ngal, a biomarker of acute kidney injury. UV-Vis and Luminescence spectrum methods showed that Ngal can inhibit the chemical reactivity of iron and EGCG through forming an Ngal-EGCG-iron complex.
