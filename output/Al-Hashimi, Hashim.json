However, comprehensively measuring how these dynamics vary with sequence is challenging. Using 1H CEST and 13C R1\u03c1 NMR, we measured Watson-Crick to Hoogsteen dynamics for an A-T base pair in thirteen trinucleotide sequence contexts. The Hoogsteen population and exchange rate varied 4-fold and 16-fold, respectively, and were dependent on both the 3'- and 5'-neighbors but only weakly dependent on monovalent ion concentration (25 versus 100 mM NaCl) and pH (6.8 versus 8.0). Flexible TA and CA dinucleotide steps exhibited the highest Hoogsteen populations, and their kinetics rates strongly depended on the 3'-neighbor. In contrast, the stiffer AA and GA steps had the lowest Hoogsteen population, and their kinetics were weakly dependent on the 3'-neighbor. The Hoogsteen lifetime was especially short when G-C neighbors flanked the A-T base pair. The Hoogsteen dynamics had a distinct sequence-dependence compared to duplex stability and minor groove width.

Hydrogen bonds are challenging to quantify by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM due to difficulty of visualizing hydrogen atom locations but can be probed with site specificity by NMR spectroscopy in solution and the solid state with the latter particularly suited to large, slowly tumbling DNA complexes. Recently, we showed that low-temperature dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid-state NMR is a valuable tool for distinguishing Hoogsteen base pairs (bps) from canonical Watson-Crick bps in various DNA systems under native-like conditions. Here, using a model 12-mer DNA duplex containing two central adenine-thymine (A-T) bps in either Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen confirmation, we demonstrate DNP solid-state NMR measurements of thymine N3-H3 bond lengths, which are sensitive to details of N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonding and permit hydrogen bonds for the two bp conformers to be systematically compared within the same DNA sequence context. For this DNA duplex, effectively identical TN3-H3 bond lengths of 1.055 \u00b1 0.011\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.060 \u00b1 0.011\u00a0\u00c5 were found for Watson-Crick A-T and Hoogsteen A (syn)-T base pairs, respectively, relative to a reference amide bond length of 1.015 \u00b1 0.010\u00a0\u00c5 determined for N-acetyl-valine under comparable experimental conditions. Considering that prior quantum chemical calculations which account for zero-point motions predict a somewhat longer effective peptide N-H bond length of 1.041\u00a0\u00c5, in agreement with solution and solid-state NMR studies of peptides and proteins at ambient temperature, to facilitate direct comparisons with these earlier studies TN3-H3 bond lengths for the DNA samples can be readily scaled appropriately to yield 1.083\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.087\u00a0\u00c5 for Watson-Crick A-T and Hoogsteen A (syn)-T bps, respectively, relative to the 1.041\u00a0\u00c5 reference peptide N-H bond length. Remarkably, in the context of the model DNA duplex, these results indicate that there are no significant differences in N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N A-T hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen bp conformers.

These interactions are mediated by intermolecular contacts, which if disrupted, lead to alterations in cell physiology. Nevertheless, the formation of intermolecular contacts nearly universally requires changes in the conformations of the interacting biomolecules. As a result, binding affinity and cellular activity crucially depend both on the strength of the contacts and on the inherent propensities to form binding-competent conformational states2,3. Thus, conformational penalties are ubiquitous in biology and must be known in order to quantitatively model binding energetics for protein and nucleic acid interactions4,5. However, conceptual and technological limitations have hindered our ability to dissect and quantitatively measure how conformational propensities affect cellular activity.

The key to this \"delta-melt\" approach is to use chemical modifications to render specific minor non-native conformations the major state. The validity and robustness of delta-melt is established for four different non-native conformations under various physiological conditions and sequence contexts through independent measurements of thermodynamic preferences using NMR. Delta-melt is faster relative to NMR, simple, and cost-effective and enables thermodynamic preferences to be measured for exceptionally low-populated conformations. Using delta-melt, we obtained rare insights into conformational cooperativity, obtaining evidence for significant cooperativity (1.0 to 2.5 kcal/mol) when simultaneously forming two adjacent Hoogsteen base pairs. We also measured the thermodynamic preferences to form G-C+ and A-T Hoogsteen and A-T base open states for nearly all 16 trinucleotide sequence contexts and found distinct sequence-specific variations on the order of 2 to 3 kcal/mol.

Although it is well-established that transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences using a combination of base readout and shape recognition, some fundamental aspects of protein-DNA binding remain poorly understood1,2. Many DNA-binding proteins induce changes in the structure of the DNA outside the intrinsic B-DNA envelope. However, how the energetic cost that is associated with distorting the DNA contributes to recognition has proven difficult to study, because the distorted DNA exists in low abundance in the unbound ensemble3-9. Here we use a high-throughput assay that we term SaMBA (saturation mismatch-binding assay) to investigate the role of DNA conformational penalties in transcription factor-DNA recognition. In SaMBA, mismatched base pairs are introduced to pre-induce structural distortions in the DNA that are much larger than those induced by changes in the Watson-Crick sequence. Notably, approximately 10% of mismatches increased transcription factor binding, and for each of the 22 transcription factors that were examined, at least one mismatch was found that increased the binding affinity. Mismatches also converted non-specific sites into high-affinity sites, and high-affinity sites into 'super sites' that exhibit stronger affinity than any known canonical binding site. Determination of high-resolution X-ray structures, combined with nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and structural analyses, showed that many of the DNA mismatches that increase binding induce distortions that are similar to those induced by protein binding-thus prepaying some of the energetic cost incurred from deforming the DNA.

Much effort has been directed toward identifying drug-like small molecules that minimize electrostatic and stacking interactions that lead to nonspecific binding of aminoglycosides and intercalators to many stem-loop RNAs. Many such compounds have been reported to bind RNAs and inhibit their cellular activities. However, target engagement and cellular selectivity assays are not routinely performed, and it is often unclear whether functional activity directly results from specific binding to the target RNA. Here, we examined the propensities of three drug-like compounds, previously shown to bind and inhibit the cellular activities of distinct stem-loop RNAs, to bind and inhibit the cellular activities of two unrelated HIV-1 stem-loop RNAs: the transactivation response element (TAR) and the rev response element stem IIB (RREIIB). All compounds bound TAR and RREIIB in vitro, and two inhibited TAR-dependent transactivation and RRE-dependent viral export in cell-based assays while also exhibiting off-target interactions consistent with nonspecific activity. A survey of X-ray and NMR structures of RNA-small molecule complexes revealed that aminoglycosides and drug-like molecules form hydrogen bonds with functional groups commonly accessible in canonical stem-loop RNA motifs, in contrast to ligands that specifically bind riboswitches. Our results demonstrate that drug-like molecules can nonspecifically bind stem-loop RNAs most likely through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions and reinforce the importance of assaying for off-target interactions and RNA selectivity in vitro and in cells when assessing novel RNA-binders.", "Keywords": ["HIV-1", "RNA-ligand binding", "RNA-targeted drug discovery", "RRE", "TAR", "specificity"], "MeSH terms": ["Aminoglycosides", "Base Pairing", "Base Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Biological Assay", "Drug Discovery", "Genes, env", "HIV Long Terminal Repeat", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Isoquinolines", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Pentamidine", "RNA, Viral", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Static Electricity", "Transcriptional Activation", "Yohimbine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan L", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Chieh", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Honglue", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura R", "Last Name": "Ganser", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hal P", "Last Name": "Bogerd", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Huynh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuze", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan R", "Last Name": "Cullen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hashim M", "Last Name": "Al-Hashimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Virology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}], "Journal": "RNA (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2021Jan"}, {"PMID": "32913127", "Title": "Hoogsteen base pairs increase the susceptibility of double-stranded DNA to cytotoxic damage.", "Abstract": "As the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases are protected in dsDNA, it is commonly assumed that deleterious alkylation damage to the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases predominantly occurs when DNA becomes single-stranded during replication and transcription. However, damage to the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases has been reported in dsDNA in vitro through mechanisms that are not understood. In addition, the extent of protection from methylation damage conferred by dsDNA relative to ssDNA has not been quantified. Watson-Crick base pairs in dsDNA exist in dynamic equilibrium with Hoogsteen base pairs that expose the Watson-Crick faces of purine nucleobases to solvent. Whether this can influence the damage susceptibility of dsDNA remains unknown. Using dot-blot and primer extension assays, we measured the susceptibility of adenine-N1 to methylation by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) when in an A-T Watson-Crick versus Hoogsteen conformation. Relative to unpaired adenines in a bulge, Watson-Crick A-T base pairs in dsDNA only conferred \u223c130-fold protection against adenine-N1 methylation, and this protection was reduced to \u223c40-fold for A(syn)-T Hoogsteen base pairs embedded in a DNA-drug complex.

Previous NMR and computational studies have indicated that the population of WC-like guanine-thymine (G-T) mispairs depends on the environment, such as the local nucleic acid sequence and solvation. To investigate these environmental effects, herein G-T mispair tautomerization processes are studied computationally in aqueous solution, in A-form and B-form DNA duplexes, and within the active site of a DNA polymerase \u03bb variant. The wobble G-T (wG-T), WC-like G-T*, and WC-like G*-T forms are considered, where * indicates the enol tautomer of the base. The minimum free energy paths for the tautomerization from the wG-T to the WC-like G-T* and from the WC-like G-T* to the WC-like G*-T are computed with mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations. The reaction free energies and free energy barriers are found to be significantly influenced by the environment. The wG-T\u2192G-T* tautomerization is predicted to be endoergic in aqueous solution and the DNA duplexes but slightly exoergic in the polymerase, with Arg517 and Asn513 providing electrostatic stabilization of G-T*. The G-T*\u2192G*-T tautomerization is also predicted to be slightly more thermodynamically favorable in the polymerase relative to these DNA duplexes. These simulations are consistent with an experimentally driven kinetic misincorporation model suggesting that G-T mispair tautomerization occurs in the ajar polymerase conformation or concertedly with the transition from the ajar to the closed polymerase conformation. Furthermore, the order of the associated two proton transfer reactions is predicted to be different in the polymerase than in aqueous solution and the DNA duplexes.

Regulatory RNAs have been shown to transiently form excited conformational states (ESs) that remodel local aspects of secondary structure. In some cases, the ES conformation has been shown to be inactive and to be poorly recognized by protein binding partners. In these cases, specifically targeting and stabilizing the RNA ES using a small molecule provides a rational structure-based strategy for inhibiting RNA activity. However, this requires that a small molecule discriminates between two conformations of the same RNA to preferentially bind and stabilize the short-lived low-abundance ES relative to the long-lived more abundant ground state (GS). Here, we tested the feasibility of this approach by designing a mutant that inverts the conformational equilibrium of the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA, such that the native GS conformation becomes a low-abundance ES. Using this mutant and NMR chemical shift mapping experiments, we show that argininamide, a ligand mimic of TAR's cognate protein binding partner Tat, is able to restore a native-like conformation by preferentially binding and stabilizing the transient and low-populated ES. A synthetic small molecule optimized to bind the TAR GS also partially stabilized the ES, whereas an aminoglycoside molecule that binds RNAs nonspecifically did not preferentially stabilize the ES to a similar extent.

Little is known about how m6A and other epitranscriptomic modifications might affect the kinetic rates of RNA folding and other conformational transitions that are also important for cellular activity. Here, we used NMR R1\u03c1 relaxation dispersion and chemical exchange saturation transfer to noninvasively and site-specifically measure nucleic acid hybridization kinetics. The methodology was validated on two DNA duplexes and then applied to examine how a single m6A alters the hybridization kinetics in two RNA duplexes.

A reduction in the annealing rate was observed robustly for two different sequence contexts at different temperatures, both in the presence and absence of Mg2+.

In this study we employ as a model system HIV-1 TAR RNA and its interaction with the ligand argininamide (ARG), a mimic of TAR's cognate protein binding partner, the transactivator Tat. We use NMR chemical shift perturbations and relaxation dispersion in combination with Bayesian inference to develop a detailed thermodynamic model of coupled conformational change and ligand binding. Starting from a comprehensive 12-state model of the equilibrium, we estimate the energies of six distinct detectable thermodynamic states that are not accessible by currently available methods. Our approach identifies a minimum of four RNA intermediates that differ in terms of the TAR conformation and ARG occupancy. The dominant bound TAR conformation features two bound ARG ligands and has an equilibrium population in the absence of ARG that is below detection limit.

The high-resolution crystal structure of TylM1 bound to the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) illustrates a network of carbon-oxygen (CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) hydrogen bonds between the substrate's sulfonium cation and residues within the active site. These interactions include hydrogen bonds between the methyl and methylene groups of the AdoMet sulfonium cation and the hydroxyl groups of Tyr14 and Ser120 in the enzyme. To examine the functions of these interactions, we generated Tyr14 to phenylalanine (Y14F) and Ser120 to alanine (S120A) mutations to selectively ablate the CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet. The TylM1 S120A mutant exhibited a modest decrease in its catalytic efficiency relative to that of the wild type (WT) enzyme, whereas the Y14F mutation resulted in an approximately 30-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency.

This reactivation occurs through reductive methylation of the cobalamin using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. Herein, we examine the molecular recognition of AdoMet by the MetH reactivation domain utilizing structural, biochemical, and computational approaches. Crystal structures of the Escherichia coli MetH reactivation domain in complex with AdoMet, the methyl transfer product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), and the AdoMet analogue inhibitor sinefungin illustrate that the ligands exhibit an analogous conformation within the solvent-exposed substrate binding cleft of the enzyme. AdoMet binding is stabilized by an intramolecular sulfur-oxygen chalcogen bond between the sulfonium and carboxylate groups of the substrate and by water-mediated carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonding between the sulfonium cation and the side chains of Glu1097 and Glu1128 that bracket the substrate binding cleft. AdoMet and sinefungin exhibited similar binding affinities for the MetH reactivation domain, whereas AdoHcy displayed an affinity for the enzyme that was an order of magnitude lower. Mutations of Glu1097 and Glu1128 diminished the AdoMet/AdoHcy binding selectivity ratio to approximately 2-fold, underscoring the role of these residues in enabling the enzyme to discriminate between the substrate and product. Together, these findings indicate that Glu1097 and Glu1128 in MetH promote high-affinity recognition of AdoMet and that sinefungin and potentially other AdoMet-based methyltransferase inhibitors can abrogate MetH reactivation, which would result in off-target effects associated with alterations in methionine homeostasis and one-carbon metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase", "Binding Sites", "Carbon", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Oxygen", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Domains", "S-Adenosylhomocysteine", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Fick", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Mary C", "Last Name": "Clay", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry , Duke University , Durham , North Carolina 27710 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Lucas", "Last Name": "Vander Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Scheiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Utah State University , Logan , Utah 84322 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Hashim", "Last Name": "Al-Hashimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry , Duke University , Durham , North Carolina 27710 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Raymond C", "Last Name": "Trievel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2018Jul03"}, {"PMID": "29728655", "Title": "High-performance virtual screening by targeting a high-resolution RNA dynamic ensemble.", "Abstract": "Dynamic ensembles hold great promise in advancing RNA-targeted drug discovery.

Our results indicate that the energetic penalty for tautomerization and/or ionization accounts for an approximately 10-2 to 10-3-fold discrimination against misincorporation, which proceeds primarily via tautomeric dGenol\u2022dT and dG\u2022dTenol, with contributions from anionic dG\u2022dT- dominant at pH 8.4 and above or for some mutagenic nucleotides.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anions", "Base Pair Mismatch", "DNA", "DNA Replication", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Guanine", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Kinetics", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mutagenesis", "Probability", "Rats", "Thymine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isaac J", "Last Name": "Kimsey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric S", "Last Name": "Szymanski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter J", "Last Name": "Zahurancik", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anisha", "Last Name": "Shakya", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Chieh", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bharathwaj", "Last Name": "Sathyamoorthy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zucai", "Last Name": "Suo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hashim M", "Last Name": "Al-Hashimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2018Feb08"}, {"PMID": "29138002", "Title": "The Mechanism of HdeA Unfolding and Chaperone Activation.", "Abstract": "HdeA is a periplasmic chaperone that is rapidly activated upon shifting the pH to acidic conditions.

We analyzed the acid-induced unfolding of HdeA using NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements, and obtained experimental evidence suggesting a complex mechanism in HdeA's acid-induced unfolding pathway, as previously postulated from molecular dynamics simulations. Counterintuitively, dissociation constant measurements show a stabilization of the HdeA dimer upon exposure to mildly acidic conditions. We provide experimental evidence that protonation of Glu37, a glutamate residue embedded in a hydrophobic pocket of HdeA, is important in controlling HdeA stabilization and thus the acid activation of this chaperone. Our data also reveal a sharp transition from folded dimer to unfolded monomer between pH3 and pH 2, and suggest the existence of a low-populated, partially folded intermediate that could assist in chaperone activation or function.

Here, we use a battery of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to examine how deleting a single bulge residue (C24) from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivation response element (TAR) trinucleotide bulge (U23-C24-U25) affects dynamics over a broad range of time scales. Shortening the bulge has an effect on picosecond-to-nanosecond interhelical and local bulge dynamics similar to that casued by increasing the Mg(2+) and Na(+) concentration, whereby a preexisting two-state equilibrium in TAR is shifted away from a bent flexible conformation toward a coaxial conformation, in which all three bulge residues are flipped out and flexible. Surprisingly, the point deletion minimally affects microsecond-to-millisecond conformational exchange directed toward two low-populated and short-lived excited conformational states that form through reshuffling of bases pairs throughout TAR. The mutant does, however, adopt a slightly different excited conformational state on the millisecond time scale, in which U23 is intrahelical, mimicking the expected conformation of residue C24 in the excited conformational state of wild-type TAR.

In this study, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to explore how secondary structure shapes the tertiary free-energy landscape of the Azoarcus ribozyme. We show that steric and connectivity constraints posed by secondary structure strongly limit the accessible conformational space of the ribozyme, and that these so-called topological constraints in turn pose strong free-energy penalties on forming different tertiary contacts. Notably, native A-minor and base-triple interactions form with low conformational free energy, while non-native tetraloop/tetraloop-receptor interactions are penalized by high conformational free energies. Topological constraints also give rise to strong cooperativity between distal tertiary interactions, quantitatively matching prior experimental measurements. The specificity of the folding landscape is further enhanced as tertiary contacts place additional constraints on the conformational space, progressively funneling the molecule to the native state.

While it is well-known that different ensembles can satisfy experimental data to within error, the extent and nature of these degeneracies, and their impact on the accuracy of the ensemble determination remains poorly understood. Here, we use simulations and a recently introduced metric for assessing ensemble similarity to explore degeneracies in determining ensembles using NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) with specific application to A-form helices in RNA. Various target ensembles were constructed representing different domain-domain orientational distributions that are confined to a topologically restricted (<10%) conformational space. Five independent sets of ensemble averaged RDCs were then computed for each target ensemble and a \"sample and select\" scheme used to identify degenerate ensembles that satisfy RDCs to within experimental uncertainty. We find that ensembles with different ensemble sizes and that can differ significantly from the target ensemble (by as much as \u2211\u03a9 \u223c 0.4 where \u2211\u03a9 varies between 0 and 1 for maximum and minimum ensemble similarity, respectively) can satisfy the ensemble averaged RDCs. These deviations increase with the number of unique conformers and breadth of the target distribution, and result in significant uncertainty in determining conformational entropy (as large as 5 kcal/mol at T = 298 K). Nevertheless, the RDC-degenerate ensembles are biased toward populated regions of the target ensemble, and capture other essential features of the distribution, including the shape. Our results identify ensemble size as a major source of uncertainty in determining ensembles and suggest that NMR interactions such as RDCs and spin relaxation, on their own, do not carry the necessary information needed to determine conformational entropy at a useful level of precision.

This glass transition arises from the freezing out of collective interhelical motional modes. The motions, resolved with site-specificity, are dynamically heterogeneous and exhibit non-Arrhenius relaxation. The microscopic origin of the glass transition is a low-dimensional, slow manifold consisting largely of the Euler angles describing interhelical reorientation. Principal component analysis over a range of temperatures covering the glass transition shows that the abrupt slowdown of motion finds its explanation in a localization transition that traps probability density into several disconnected conformational pools over the low-dimensional energy landscape. Upon temperature increase, the probability density pools then flood a larger basin, akin to a lakes-to-sea transition.

This chapter describes NMR-based approaches for characterizing microsecond-to-millisecond changes in RNA secondary structure that are directed toward short-lived and low-populated species often referred to as \"excited states.\" Compared to larger scale changes in RNA secondary structure, transitions toward excited states do not require assistance from chaperones, are often orders of magnitude faster, and are localized to a small number of nearby base pairs in and around noncanonical motifs. Here, we describe a procedure for characterizing RNA excited states using off-resonance R1\u03c1 NMR relaxation dispersion utilizing low-to-high spin-lock fields (25-3000 Hz). R1\u03c1 NMR relaxation dispersion experiments are used to measure carbon and nitrogen chemical shifts in base and sugar moieties of the excited state. The chemical shift data are then interpreted with the aid of secondary structure prediction to infer potential excited states that feature alternative secondary structures. Candidate structures are then tested by using mutations, single-atom substitutions, or by changing physiochemical conditions, such as pH and temperature, to either stabilize or destabilize the candidate excited state. The resulting chemical shifts of the mutants or under different physiochemical conditions are then compared to those of the ground and excited states.

Topological constraints also give rise to long-range correlations between the relative orientation of tRNA's helices, which in turn provides a mechanism for encoding thermodynamic cooperativity between distinct tertiary interactions. These aspects of topological constraints make it such that only several tertiary interactions are needed to confine tRNA to its native global structure and specify functionally important 3D dynamics.

R1\u03c1 data computed by solving the Bloch-McConnell equations reveals small but significant asymmetry with respect to offset (R1\u03c1 (\u0394\u03a9)\u2260R1\u03c1 (-\u0394\u03a9)), which is a hallmark of slow-to-intermediate exchange, even under conditions of fast exchange for free precession chemical exchange line broadening (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9>10). A grid search analysis combined with bootstrap and Monte-Carlo based statistical approaches for estimating uncertainty in exchange parameters reveals that both the sign and magnitude of \u0394\u03c9 can be determined at a useful level of uncertainty for systems in fast exchange (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9<10) but that this depends on the uncertainty in the R1\u03c1 data and requires a thorough examination of the multidimensional variation of \u03c7(2) as a function of exchange parameters.

Biochemical and biophysical studies led to a qualitative tRNA selection model in which ribosomal A-site residues A1492 and A1493 (A1492/3) flip out in response to cognate tRNA binding, promoting the subsequent reactions, but not in the case of near-cognate or non-cognate tRNA. However, this model was recently questioned by X-ray structures revealing conformations of extrahelical A1492/3 and domain closure of the decoding center in both cognate and near-cognate tRNA bound ribosome complexes, suggesting that the non-specific flipping of A1492/3 has no active role in tRNA selection. We explore this question by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations, aided with fluorescence and NMR experiments, to probe the free energy cost of extrahelical flipping of 1492/3 and the strain energy associated with domain conformational change. Our rigorous calculations demonstrate that the A1492/3 flipping is indeed a specific response to the binding of cognate tRNA, contributing 3kcal/mol to the specificity of tRNA selection. Furthermore, the different A-minor interactions in cognate and near-cognate complexes propagate into the conformational strain and contribute another 4kcal/mol in domain closure. The recent structure of ribosome with features of extrahelical A1492/3 and closed domain in near-cognate complex is reconciled by possible tautomerization of the wobble base pair in mRNA-tRNA.

This ensemble reveals local motions in and around the bulge involving changes in stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, which are undetectable by traditional spin relaxation and drive global changes in interhelical orientation. This new approach broadens the scope of using RDCs in characterizing the dynamics of nucleic acids.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["HIV Long Terminal Repeat", "HIV-1", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "RNA, Viral"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lo\u00efc", "Last Name": "Salmon", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gavin", "Last Name": "Bascom", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ioan", "Last Name": "Andricioaei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hashim M", "Last Name": "Al-Hashimi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2013Apr10"}, {"PMID": "23320790", "Title": "Utility of 1H NMR chemical shifts in determining RNA structure and dynamics.", "Abstract": "The development of methods for predicting NMR chemical shifts with high accuracy and speed is increasingly allowing use of these abundant, readily accessible measurements in determining the structure and dynamics of proteins. For nucleic acids, however, despite the availability of semiempirical methods for predicting (1)H chemical shifts, their use in determining the structure and dynamics has not yet been examined. Here, we show that (1)H chemical shifts offer powerful restraints for RNA structure determination, allowing discrimination of native structure from non-native states to within 2-4 \u00c5, and <3 \u00c5 when highly flexible residues are ignored. Theoretical simulations shows that although (1)H chemical shifts can provide valuable information for constructing RNA dynamic ensembles, large uncertainties in the chemical shift predictions and inherent degeneracies lead to higher uncertainties as compared to residual dipolar couplings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Hydrogen", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aaron T", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine 1102 Natural Sciences 2, Irvine, California 92697, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ioan", "Last Name": "Andricioaei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hashim M", "Last Name": "Al-Hashimi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.
