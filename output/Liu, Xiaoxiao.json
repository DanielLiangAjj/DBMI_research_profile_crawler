Catalyzed by lipase and lipoxygenase, unsaturated lipid hydroperoxides (HPOs) were synthesized. 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z, 11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE), one compound of HPOs, was subsequently reduced to 13(S)-hydroxy-9Z, 11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) by cysteine. Upon the optimized conditions, 75.28\u00a0mg of 13-HPODE and 4.01\u00a0mg of 13-HODE were produced from per milliliter of oil. The co-immobilized catalysts exhibited improved yield compared to the mixture of individually immobilized catalysts. Moreover, it demonstrated satisfactory durability and recyclability, maintaining a relative HPOs yield of 78.5% after 5\u00a0cycles.

Two wheat cultivars: the N deficiency-tolerant cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY) and the N deficiency-sensitive cultivar Aikang 58 (AK) were used to test if the high N-deficiency tolerance was related with lipid metabolism. The results showed that N deficiency inhibited the morpho-physiological parameters in both XY and AK cultivars, which showed a significant decrease in biomass, N content, photosynthetic efficiency, and lipid contents. However, these decreases were more pronounced in AK than XY. In addition, XY showed a notable increase in fatty acid unsaturation, relatively well-maintained chloroplast ultrastructure, and minimized damage of lipid peroxidation and enhanced PSII activity under N-deficient condition, as compared with AK. Transcription levels of many genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid desaturation were up-regulated in response to N deficiency in two wheat cultivars, while the expressions were much higher in XY than AK under N deficiency.

Our study revealed a biphasic activation of two MAPK cascade pathways, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK, as a notably activated host molecular event in response to ILTV infection. It exhibits antiviral functions at different stages of infection. Initially, the MEK/ERK pathway is activated upon viral invasion, leading to a broad suppression of metabolic pathways crucial for ILTV replication, thereby inhibiting viral replication from the early stage of ILTV infection. As the viral replication progresses, the p38 MAPK pathway activates its downstream transcription factor, STAT1, further hindering viral replication. Interestingly, ILTV overcomes this biphasic antiviral barrier by hijacking host p38-AKT axis, which protects infected cells from the apoptosis induced by infection and establishes an intracellular equilibrium conducive to extensive ILTV replication.

Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides led to Ni contamination in agricultural soils, thus reducing yield and quality of tomatoes. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of Ni toxicity responses in tomato plants have largely not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the Ni toxicity response in tomato plants by physio-biochemical, transcriptomic and molecular regulatory network analyses. Ni toxicity repressed photosynthesis, induced the formation of brush-like lateral roots and interfered with micronutrient accumulation in tomato seedlings. Ni toxicity also induced reactive oxygen species accumulation and oxidative stress responses in plants. Furthermore, Ni toxicity reduced the phytohormone concentrations, including auxin, cytokinin and gibberellic acid, thereby retarding plant growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Ni toxicity altered the expression of genes involved in carbon/nitrogen metabolism pathways.

Using a unique dataset of city-to-city tuples based on 813,684 online consultation records and combining it with region-level data from multiple external sources, we find that while regional medical resource disparity drives patients from medically disadvantaged regions to seek online consultations with physicians from medically advantaged regions, geographic distance and cultural differences tend to constrain these consultations. We also find that cultural differences can amplify the impact of regional medical resource disparity, whereas geographic distance may lessen this effect. Further, we discover that the constraining effect of geographic distance is partly due to the online-to-offline nature of online medical consultations.

RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining for markers NR4A3/NR4A2, DOG-1, S100, and mammaglobin were utilized on 41 AciCCs and 11 secretory carcinoma (SC) samples. NR4A3 was evident in 35 AciCCs, while the residual 6 were NR4A3-negative and NR4A2-positive; SC samples were consistently NR4A3-negative. A novel fusion, PON3 exon 1- LCN1 exon 5, was detected in 9/41 (21.9%) AciCCs, exhibiting a classical histologic pattern with serous cell components growing in solid sheets alongside the intercalated duct-like component. Clinical follow-up of 39 patients over a median of 59 months revealed diverse prognostic outcomes: 34 patients exhibited no disease evidence, whereas the remaining 5 experienced poorer prognosis, involving local recurrence, lymph node, and distant metastasis, and disease-associated death, 4 of which harbored the PON3::LCN1 fusion. In addition, the HTN3::MSANTD3 fusion was recurrently identified in 7/41 AciCC cases. SC patients lacked both fusions.

Higher PKMYT1 expression levels indicate poor prognosis in PDAC patients. PKMYT1 ablation inhibits tumor growth and proliferation in vitro and in vivo by regulating cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PKMYT1 shows efficacy in multiple PDAC cell models and effectively induces tumor regression without overt toxicity in PDAC cell line-derived xenograft and in more clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft models.

In ovo vaccination pushes the initial immunization time forward to the incubation period, thereby providing earlier immune protection for chicks. In ovo vaccination is currently a research hotspot of poultry disease prevention and control, which is in line with the intensification of poultry production. However, the vaccines currently available for in ovo vaccination are limited and cannot meet the needs of industrial development, so how to efficiently activate the adaptive immune response of chicken embryos becomes the key to restrict product development and technological progress of in ovo vaccination. Its breakthrough, to a large extent, depends on systematic illustration of the mechanism underlying the adaptive immune response post immunization.

However, the roles of specific TRPC proteins in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain poorly understood. We observed that TRPC1 and TRPC6 were highly expressed in the area at risk (AAR) in a coronary artery ligation induced I/R model. Trpc1-/- mice exhibited improved cardiac function, lower serum Troponin T and serum creatine kinase level, smaller infarct volume, less fibrotic scars, and fewer apoptotic cells after myocardial-I/R than wild-type or Trpc6-/- mice. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of Trpc1 using adeno-associated virus 9 mitigated myocardial I/R injury. Furthermore, Trpc1 deficiency protected adult mouse ventricular myocytes (AMVMs) and HL-1\u00a0cells from death during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in Trpc1-/- cardiomyocytes. Among these genes, oxoglutarate\u00a0dehydrogenase-like (Ogdhl) was markedly downregulated. Moreover, Trpc1 deficiency impaired the calcineurin (CaN)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway in AMVMs. Suppression of this pathway inhibited Ogdhl upregulation and ROS generation in HL-1\u00a0cells under H/R conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed NF-\u03baB binding to the Ogdhl promoter. The cardioprotective effect of Trpc1 deficiency was canceled out by overexpression of NF-\u03baB and Ogdhl in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our findings reveal that TRPC1 is upregulated in the AAR following myocardial I/R, leading to increased Ca2+ influx into associated cardiomyocytes. Subsequently, this upregulates Ogdhl expression through the CaN/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ultimately exacerbating ROS production and aggravating myocardial I/R injury.", "Keywords": ["Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion", "OGDHL", "Reactive oxygen species", "TRPC1"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hui-Nan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Management, Second Affiliated Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Quan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Shao-Yuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Xiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Mo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan-Yuan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying-Da", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Chang-Yang", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Department of Ultrasound Diagnostics, Second Affiliated Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing-Ru", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Qiang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical analysis", "PubDate": "2023Nov"}, {"PMID": "38142446", "Title": "Acetylation of xenogeneic silencer H-NS regulates biofilm development through the nitrogen homeostasis regulator in Shewanella.", "Abstract": "Adjusting intracellular metabolic pathways and adopting suitable live state such as biofilms, are crucial for bacteria to survive environmental changes. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding how the histone-like nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein modulates the expression of the genes involved in biofilm formation, the precise modification that the H-NS protein undergoes to alter its DNA binding activity is still largely uncharacterized. This study revealed that acetylation of H-NS at Lys19 inhibits biofilm development in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 by downregulating the expression of glutamine synthetase, a critical enzyme in glutamine synthesis. We further found that nitrogen starvation, a likely condition in biofilm development, induces deacetylation of H-NS and the trimerization of nitrogen assimilation regulator GlnB. The acetylated H-NS strain exhibits significantly lower cellular glutamine concentration, emphasizing the requirement of H-NS deacetylation in Shewanella biofilm development. Moreover, we discovered in vivo that the activation of glutamine biosynthesis pathway and the concurrent suppression of the arginine synthesis pathway during both pellicle and attached biofilms development, further suggesting the importance of fine tune nitrogen assimilation by H-NS acetylation in Shewanella.

"Abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) has been the most challenging subtype of BC, consisting of 20% of BC with an apparent correlation with poor prognosis. Despite that pyrotinib, a new HER2 inhibitor, has led to dramatic improvements in prognosis, the efficacy of pyrotinib monotherapy remains largely restricted due to its acquired resistance. Therefore, identifying a new potential antitumor drug in combination with pyrotinib to amplify therapeutic efficacy is a pressing necessity. Here, we reported a novel combination of pyrotinib with chrysin and explored its antitumor efficacy and the underlying mechanism in HER2-positive BC. We determined that pyrotinib combined with chrysin yielded a potent synergistic effect to induce more evident cell cycle arrest, inhibit the proliferation of BT-474 and SK-BR-3 BC cells, and repress in vivo tumor growth in xenograft mice models. This may be attributed to enhanced autophagy induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment of pyrotinib and chrysin induced ubiquitination and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) degradation by upregulating zinc finger and BTB/POZ domain-containing family protein 16 (ZBTB16) in tumorigenesis of BC. Mechanistically, we identified that miR-16-5p was a potential upstream regulator of ZBTB16, and it showed a significant inverse correlation with ZBTB16. Inhibition of miR-16-5p overexpression by restoring ZBTB16 significantly potentiated the overall antitumor efficacy of pyrotinib combined with chrysin against HER2-positive BC. Together, these findings demonstrate that the combined treatment of pyrotinib and chrysin enhances autophagy in HER2-positive BC through an unrecognized miR-16-5p/ZBTB16/G6PD axis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Female", "Breast Neoplasms", "MicroRNAs", "Autophagy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, 52074, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Zhiying", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 221000, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaorong", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Center, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University; Jiangsu Center for the Collaboration and Innovation of Cancer Biotherapy, Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 221000, Xuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology and Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Rotterdam Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, 3015 GD, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Department of General Surgery, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Kunrui", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Jing", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. jingjing@wchscu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Breast Health Medicine, Cancer Center, Breast Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. luoting@wchscu.cn."}], "Journal": "Signal transduction and targeted therapy", "PubDate": "2023Dec18"}, {"PMID": "38105791", "Title": "Clinical value of combined predictors of RET%, \u03b3-GT, LDH in the ABO neonatal hemolytic disease.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the prognostic significance of the amalgamated indicators, reticulocyte percentage (RET%), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and \u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (\u03b3-GT), in neonatal ABO hemolytic disease.", "Keywords": ["ABO hemolytic disease", "combined predictor", "lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)", "newborn", "\u03b3-glutamyltransferase (\u03b3-GT)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingchao", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunyan", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Lyu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "38056895", "Title": "Tumor cell-intrinsic SETD2 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade through the NR2F1-STAT1 pathway.", "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies can induce durable tumor regression, but most patients do not respond.

In this study, we use a combination of approaches to demonstrate that insulin signaling and FoxO mediate the diapause response in C. septempunctata. In diapausing beetles, application of exogenous insulin and knocking down expression of CsFoxo with RNA interference (RNAi) both rescued beetles from developmental arrest. In non-diapausing beetles, knocking down expression of the insulin receptor (CsInR) with RNA interference (RNAi) arrested ovarian development and decreased juvenile hormone (JH) content to levels comparable to the diapause state.

This work develops a task specific approach for efficient dissolve of galactomannan in ionic liquids (ILs) by destructing and reconstructing intermolecular/intramolecular hydrogen bonds of galactomannan. Combining density functional theory calculations and experimental results, a reasonable mechanism of polysaccharide dissolution is proposed that the hydrogen bond networks of polysaccharide are broken, thus the hydroxyl groups are fully exposed and activated to facilitate functionalization. In view of the enhanced solubilization, an excellent effect in selenylation of galactomannan is notably improved by employing ILs with dual roles as solvents and catalysts.

Furthermore, a surprising finding is observed that selenium content and average molecular mass of functionalized polysaccharide can be manipulated by the anions-cations synergistic effect which is highly dependent on SFILs acidity strength.

Exosomes were extracted from the serum of GC patients and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA). CD81, CD63, Bcl-2, Bax, and pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) protein levels were detected using western blot assay. circKIAA1797, microRNA-4429 (miR-4429), and PBX3 mRNA were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).

Glucose consumption and lactate production levels were examined using glycolysis detection kits.

Here, we investigated the regulatory role of macrophage CAPN4 in the phenotypic transformation of macrophages and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. We found that CAPN4 was the most upregulated subtype of the calpain family in CVB3-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw 264.7\u00a0cells after CVB3 infection and was upregulated in cardiac macrophages from CVB3-infected mice. Conditional knockout of CAPN4 (CAPN4flox/flox; LYZ2-Cre, CAPN4-cKO mice) ameliorated inflammation and myocardial injury and improved cardiac function and survival after CVB3 infection. Enrichment analysis revealed that macrophage differentiation and the interleukin signaling pathway were the most predominant biological processes in macrophages after CVB3 infection. We further found that CVB3 infection and the overexpression of CAPN4 promoted macrophage M1 polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while CAPN4 knockdown reversed these changes. Correspondingly, CAPN4-cKO alleviated CVB3-induced M1 macrophage transformation and NLRP3 expression and moderately increased M2 transformation in vivo. The culture supernatant of CAPN4-overexpressing or CVB3-infected macrophages impaired cardiac fibroblast function and viability.

Sensor NLRs are responsible for pathogen effector recognition. Helper NLRs function downstream of sensor NLRs to transduce signaling and induce cell death and immunity. Activation of sensor NLRs that contain TIR (Toll/interleukin-1receptor) domains generates small molecules that induce an association between a downstream heterodimer signalosome of EDS1 (EnhancedDisease Susceptibility 1)/SAG101 (Senescence-AssociatedGene 101) and the helper NLR of NRG1 (NRequired Gene 1). Autoactive NRG1s oligomerize and form calcium signaling channels largely localized at the plasma membrane (PM). The molecular mechanisms of helper NLR PM association and effector-induced NRG1 oligomerization are not well characterized. We demonstrate that helper NLRs require positively charged residues in their N-terminal domains for phospholipid binding and PM association before and after activation, despite oligomerization and conformational changes that accompany activation. We demonstrate that effector activation of a TIR-containing sensor NLR induces NRG1 oligomerization at the PM and that the cytoplasmic pool of EDS1/SAG101 is critical for cell death function. EDS1/SAG101 cannot be detected in the oligomerized NRG1 resistosome, suggesting that additional unknown triggers might be required to induce the dissociation of EDS1/SAG101 from the previously described NRG1/EDS1/SAG101 heterotrimer before subsequent NRG1 oligomerization.

During angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) exhibit inhomogeneous multicellular behaviors referred to as \"cell mixing,\" in which ECs repetitively exchange their relative positions, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we identified the coordinated linear and rotational movements potentiated by cell-cell contact as drivers of sprouting angiogenesis using in\u00a0vitro and in silico approaches. VE-cadherin confers the coordinated linear motility that facilitated forward sprout elongation, although it is dispensable for rotational movement, which was synchronous without VE-cadherin. Mathematical modeling recapitulated the EC motility in the two-cell state and angiogenic morphogenesis with the effects of VE-cadherin-knockout. Finally, we found that VE-cadherin-dependent EC compartmentalization potentiated branch elongations, and confirmed this by mathematical simulation.

In this study, we demonstrated that constitutive expression of AtRPS2 increased abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity during seedling stage, the shoot length of transgenic plants were shorter than wild type plants. Exogenous application of ABA markedly induced the expression of stress-related genes and promoted stomatal close in transgenic plants. Overexpression of AtRPS2 also enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice, transgenic plants exhibited higher survival rates under drought and salt conditions than wild type plants. The activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher in AtRPS2 transgenic rice than wild type plants. In addition, the expression of stress-related genes and ABA-responsive genes were significantly upregulated in AtRPS2 transgenic plants than wild type plants under drought and salt treatments. Besides, exogenous application of ABA could facilitate drought and salt tolerance in AtRPS2 transgenic plants.

Current IV-OCT catheters that employ proximal actuators and torque coils are susceptible to non-uniform rotational distortion (NURD) in tortuous vessels, while distal micromotor-driven catheters struggle with complete 360\u00b0 imaging due to wiring artifacts. In this study, we developed a miniature optical scanning probe with an integrated piezoelectric-driven fiber optic slip ring (FOSR) to facilitate smooth navigation and precise imaging within tortuous vessels. The FOSR features a coil spring-wrapped optical lens serving as a rotor, enabling efficient 360\u00b0 optical scanning. The structurally-and-functionally-integrated design significantly streamlines the probe (with a diameter of 0.85 mm and a length of 7 mm) while maintaining an excellent rotational speed of 10,000 rpm. High-precision 3D printing technology ensures accurate optical alignment of the fiber and lens inside the FOSR, with a maximum insertion loss variation of 2.67 dB during probe rotation. Finally, a vascular model demonstrated smooth probe insertion into the carotid artery, and imaging of oak leaf, metal rod phantoms, and ex vivo porcine vessels verified its capabilities for precise optical scanning, comprehensive 360\u00b0 imaging, and artifact elimination.

One challenge is the low kinetics involved in the conversion of Li2S4 to Li2S. Here, we reveal that highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles play a unique role in the reduction of Li2S4. Ni-porous carbon (Ni-PC) decorated in situ on a free-standing carbon nanotube sponge (CNTS/Ni-PC) enriches the current response of liquid phase Li2S4 and Li2S2 around the cathode more than 8.1 and 5.7 times higher than that of the CNTS blank sample, respectively, greatly boosting the kinetics and decreasing the reaction overpotential of Li2S4 reduction (lower Tafel slope and larger current response). Thus, with the same total overpotential, more space is provided for the concentration difference overpotential, allowing the more soluble polysulfide intermediates farther away from the surface of the conductive materials to be reduced based on the \"wane and wax\" strategy, and significantly improving the sulfur utilization.

The chemical-microbial pathway by which LMWOA affects arsenic (As) cycling in the rhizosphere of paddy soils is still unclear. In this study, three typical LMWOAs (acetic acid (AA), oxalic acid (OA), and citric acid (CA)) in rice root exudates were added to As-contaminated soil at a concentration of 10\u00a0mM, mimicking the rhizosphere environment. The results showed that the addition of AA and OA inhibited the mobilization of As in the rhizosphere soil. After 14 days of incubation, the content of As in the porewater of AA and OA decreased by 40% and 22%, respectively, compared with the control. AA hindered the mobilization of As in soil via promoting the formation of secondary minerals. The addition of OA inhibits the mobilization of As via increasing the proportion of As (V) in porewater and promoting the formation of secondary minerals in soil. In addition, OA addition not only significantly increased the aioA gene abundance but also notably enriched the microorganisms containing As (III) methylation functional genes (arsM).

Recently, we noticed that clinicians in some comparative studies used direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to prevent thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether DOACs are better than recommended heparin for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, a direct comparison of the prophylactic effects and safety between DOACs and heparin is needed. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 2019 to December 1, 2022. Randomized controlled trials or retrospective studies comparing the efficacy or safety of DOACs with that of heparin in preventing thromboembolism for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. We assessed endpoints and publication bias using Stata 14.0. Five studies comprising 1360 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate cases were identified in the databases. Comparing the embolism incidence, we found that DOACs had a better effect than heparin, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), in preventing thromboembolism (risk ratio [RR]\u2009=\u20090.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.43-0.91], P\u2009=\u20090.014). Considering safety, DOACs resulted in less bleeding than heparin during hospitalization (RR\u2009=\u20090.52, 95% CI [0.11-2.44], P\u2009=\u20090.411). Similar mortality was discovered in the 2 groups (RR\u2009=\u20090.94, 95% CI [0.59-1.51], P\u2009=\u20090.797). In noncritically hospitalized patients with COVID-19, DOACs are superior to heparin, even LMWH, in preventing thromboembolism. Compared with heparin, DOACs have a lower trend of bleeding and yield a similar mortality rate. Therefore, DOACs may be a better alternative for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "direct oral anticoagulants", "heparin", "meta-analysis", "thromboembolism"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Heparin", "Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight", "Anticoagulants", "Retrospective Studies", "Venous Thromboembolism", "COVID-19", "Hemorrhage", "Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xudong", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Guangyu", "Last Name": "Ao", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Yihan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Clinical Medical College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongmei", "Last Name": "Ran", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Chengdu First People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."}], "Journal": "Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis", "PubDate": "2023Jan-Dec"}, {"PMID": "37084855", "Title": "An ecdysteroid-regulated 16-kDa protein homolog participates in the immune response of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii.", "Abstract": "An ecdysteroid-regulated 16-kDa protein homolog (named Pc-E16), encoding 150 amino acid residues with a conserved MD-2-related lipid-recognition domain, was first identified in Procambarus clarkii.

Recombinant Pc-E16 protein was successfully expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells, and polyclonal antibodies against purified Pc-E16 proteins were prepared. In comparison with other tissues, Pc-E16 was highly expressed in the intestine; real-time PCR and Western blotting results indicated that Pc-E16 expression was significantly induced by lipopolysaccharides in hepatopancreas and hemocytes. Pc-E16-mediated signaling pathways were investigated by digital gene expression analysis following RNA interference targeting Pc-E16. A total of 6103 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 3318 were up- and 2785 were downregulated. Many DEGs were involved in binding and catalytic activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were clustered into 225 pathways, and 15 significantly enriched pathways were identified at the immune system level. In addition, the expression level of Pc-E16 in hemocytes and hepatopancreas was obviously downregulated at 48\u00a0h after dsRNA injection, and Pc-E16-RNAi treatment affected the expression levels of immune-related genes.

Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has rapidly become globally dominant in the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high infectivity and immune evasion.

The goal of generating such a hand-curated diverse dataset is to advance the development of tracing algorithms and enable generalizable benchmarking. Together with image quality features, we pooled the data in an interactive web application that enables users and developers to perform principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, correlation and clustering, visualization of imaging and tracing data, and benchmarking of automatic tracing algorithms in user-defined data subsets. The image quality metrics explain most of the variance in the data, followed by neuromorphological features related to neuron size. We observed that diverse algorithms can provide complementary information to obtain accurate results and developed a method to iteratively combine methods and generate consensus reconstructions. The consensus trees obtained provide estimates of the neuron structure ground truth that typically outperform single algorithms in noisy datasets.

Understanding the mechanisms of NO-involved stress alleviation is progressing; however, a quantitative description of the alleviative capacity of NO against heavy metal stress is still lacking. We combined the results of 86 studies using meta-analysis to statistically assess the responses of heavy metal-stressed plants to NO supply across several metal stresses and plant families. The results showed that plant biomass was consistently improved following NO supply to metal-stressed plants. NO played an important role in mitigating oxidative damage caused by heavy metal stress by significantly stimulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, NO supply consistently increased the Ca, Fe, and Mg contents in both leaves and roots. Plant tissues accumulated less heavy metals when exposed to heavy metal stress after NO addition. Additionally, the best concentration of SNP (an NO donor) for hydroponic culture is in the range of 75-150 \u03bcM. We further confirmed that NO application can generally alleviate plant heavy metal stress and its action pathway. The results presented here can help guide future applications of NO as a plant growth regulator in agriculture and breeding plants for heavy metal stress tolerance.", "Keywords": ["heavy metal stress", "nitric oxide", "oxidative stress", "stress alleviation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Academy of Eco Xi'an, Xi'an University, Xi'an 710065, China."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Natural Forest Protection Project Management Center, Xi'an 710082, China."}, {"First Name": "Qingbo", "Last Name": "Ke", "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Yangling 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Yangling 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Shiwen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Yangling 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianpeng", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "School of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Academy of Eco Xi'an, Xi'an University, Xi'an 710065, China."}], "Journal": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023Mar29"}, {"PMID": "37014466", "Title": "FAM3A Deficiency\u2009-\u2009Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction Underlies Post-Infarct Mortality and Heart Failure.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial protein sequence similarity 3 gene family member A (FAM3A) plays important roles in the electron transfer chain, while its functions in the heart are still unknown.

Litsea cubeba essential oil (LC-EO), one of the natural essential oils, exhibited promising biological activities. In this study, the antibacterial effects and possible mechanisms of LC-EO on S. sonnei and its application in lettuce medium were investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of LC-EO against S. sonnei ATCC 25931 and CMCC 51592 was 4 and 6\u2009\u03bcL/mL, respectively. The LC-EO could inhibit the growth of S. sonnei, and decreased S. sonnei to undetectable levels with 4\u2009\u03bcL/mL for 1\u2009h in Luria-Bertani broth. The antibacterial mechanism indicated that after the treatment of LC-EO, the production of reactive oxygen species and the activity of superoxide dismutase were significantly elevated in S. sonnei cells, and eventually led to the lipid oxidation product, the malondialdehyde content that significantly increased. Moreover, LC-EO at 2 MIC could destroy 96.51% of bacterial cell membrane integrity, and made S. sonnei cells to appear wrinkled with a rough surface, so that the intracellular adenosine triphosphate leakage was about 0.352-0.030\u2009\u03bcmol/L. Finally, the results of application evaluation indicated that the addition of LC-EO at 4\u2009\u03bcL/mL in lettuce leaves and 6\u2009\u03bcL/mL in lettuce juice could decrease the number of S. sonnei to undetectable levels without remarkable influence on the lettuce leaf sensory quality.

It is believed that NA may play a crucial role in the recovery of human cognitive disorders. Although many literatures have shown that NA has some neuroprotective effect in experimental animal models, the detailed neuroprotective mechanism of NA is still poorly understood. In this study, we applied behavioral, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to analyze the neuroprotective effect of NA and its molecular mechanism in AD (Alzheimer's disease) model mice. We demonstrated that NA improved motor skills and learning and memory abilities of mice at the behavioral level. To further understand the specific pathways involved in this protective effect, we applied the metabolomics and transcriptomics profilings and focused on the expression patterns of genes that NA might alter, particularly those related to the accumulation of metabolites in the brain. According to the results, pathways related to neuroinflammation were significantly increased in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced AD mice compared with the normal control, and pathways related to neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity were significantly downregulated. When NA was used for protection, these signaling pathways induced by LPS were partially reversed. At the same time, compared with the AD model group, upregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis and downregulation of amino acid metabolic pathways were particularly pronounced in the NA treatment group. We also verified the enzymes of some metabolic pathways were consistent with transcriptome result. In summary, our results show that NA can significantly ameliorate LPS-induced neuroinflammation and deterioration of learning and memory, and exerts a neuroprotective function through regulation of multiple gene transcription and metabolism pathways. In particular, the arachidonic acid metabolism which related to inflammation and the amino acids metabolism which related to the synthesis of neurotransmitters were most significant response to NA treatment.

Immunotherapy shows promise in cancer therapy due to its capacity to manipulate the immune system to attack tumor cells with less toxic and durable immune responses. However, the low immunogenicity and limited immune cell infiltration in a glioblastoma lead to a weakened antitumor immune response, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic efficacy. A compelling solution is provided by oncolytic adenovirus (OAs), which can selectively replicate within tumor cells while simultaneously promoting antitumor immunity. Herein, we constructed an oncolytic adenovirus reservoir (OAR) by shocking OA-loaded tumor cells in liquid nitrogen to eliminate proliferation and pathogenicity.

In a mouse intracranial glioblastoma model, OARs could efficiently induce dendritic cells' maturation, facilitate the tumor recruitment, and promote the infiltration of cytotoxic effector T lymphocytes via a single treatment, resulting in specific antitumor immune responses and long-term animal survival.

However, the detailed neuroprotective effects and mode of action of nervonic acid have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we used an MPTP-stimulated mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) model as a target to investigate the neuroprotective effects by behavioral tests and integrative analysis of trancriptomes and metabolomes of PD mouse brain with nervonic acid injections. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptomes showed that the genes involved in neuroinflammation were significantly increased after MPTP induction and have been greatly inhibited by nervonic acid injection, while nervonic acid also greatly improved nerve growth and synaptic plasticity pathways which were significantly downregulated by MPTP. At the same time, the upregulation of oleic acid and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways and the downregulation of amino acid metabolism pathways in metabolomes were particularly highlighted in the nervonic acid protection groups compared with the PD model. Meanwhile, it was found that arachidonic acid, oleic acid and taurine play an important regulatory role in the neuroprotective mechanism of nervonic acid through fatty acid metabolism by integrative analysis.

Various researchers have tried to explain the underlying mechanism of LA's effects on chronic pain. This article uses metabolomics technology to investigate the metabolite alterations in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) when lappaconitine hydrobromide (LAH) was injected in an inflammatory pain model, to explain the molecular mechanism of its analgesia from a metabolomics perspective. The pain model used in this study was a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain model in rats. There were two treatment groups receiving different dosages of LAH (4 mg/kg LAH and 8 mg/kg LAH). The analgesic mechanism of LAH was investigated with an analgesic behavioral test, tissue sections, and metabolomics. The results of the analgesic behavioral experiment showed that both 4 mg/kg LAH and 8 mg/kg LAH could significantly improve the paw withdrawal latency (PWL) of rats. The tissue section results showed that LAH could reduce the inflammatory response and enlargement of the paw and ankle of rats and that there was no significant difference in the tissue sections of the DRG. The metabolomics results showed that retinol metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the CFA-induced inflammatory pain model were significantly affected and may exacerbate the inflammatory reactions and initiate persistent pain; in addition, the linoleic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism were also slightly affected. Among them, the alpha-linolenic acid metabolism was up-regulated after LAH treatment, while the retinol metabolism was down-regulated. These results suggest that LAH could effectively reduce inflammatory pain and might achieve this by regulating the lipid metabolism in the rat DRG.", "Keywords": ["complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA)", "dorsal root ganglion (DRG)", "inflammatory pain", "lappaconitine hydrobromide (LAH)", "metabolomics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueqi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengdou", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Orthopaedic Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinliang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "Journal": "Metabolites", "PubDate": "2022Sep29"}, {"PMID": "36278719", "Title": "Fast UV-Curable Zwitter-Wettable Coatings with Reliable Antifogging/Frost-Resisting Performances.", "Abstract": "Antifogging surfaces with unique properties to migrate severe fog formation have gained extensive interest, which is of particular interest for transparent substrates to obtain high visibility and transparency. To date, a large number of strategies including superhydrophilic or superhydrophobic surfaces and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based composite coatings have been developed based on different mechanisms. Although these surfaces exhibit effective antifogging properties, the rigid nanostructures, cumbersome preparation, and the need for UV light excitation largely limit their widespread applications. Herein, we report a zwitter-wettable antifogging and frost-resisting coating through a fast UV-curable cross-linking of copolymer with benzophenone groups. A series of random copolymers consisting of hydrophilic hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEA), hydrophobic methyl methacrylate (MMA), and benzophenone-based acrylate units are developed by thermally triggered free-radical polymerization. Upon UV light irradiation, a highly efficient antifogging/frost-resisting coating is covalently bonded on a polycarbonate plate surface, maintaining a light transmission higher than 85%, which was confirmed in both high and low temperature anti-fog tests. Moreover, the wetting behaviors reveal that the antifogging performance exhibited by the zwitter-wettable surface mainly relies on its surface water-adsorbing capability to imbibe condensed water vapor on the surface outmost layer. Notably, the antifogging/frost-resisting behaviors can be well regulated by adjusting the hydrophilic/hydrophobic units, due to the proper balance between the water-adsorption and coating stability. Owing to its simplicity, low-cost preparation and high efficiency, this UV-curable acrylate antifogging coating may find a wide range of applications in various display devices in analytical and detection instruments.", "Keywords": ["UV illumination", "acrylate coating", "antifogging", "frost-resisting", "zwitter-wettable"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Agriculture College, Yanbian University, Yanbian 133002, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun 130119, China."}, {"First Name": "Boxin", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Practice, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China."}, {"First Name": "Shengzhu", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130061, China."}], "Journal": "Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2022Oct13"}, {"PMID": "36266651", "Title": "Global burden and trends of rotavirus infection-associated deaths from 1990 to 2019: an observational trend study.", "Abstract": "Rotavirus is the leading global pathogen of diarrhea-associated mortality and poses a great threat to public health in all age groups.

Tetrapods have a single-copy IRF4 gene, while teleosts harbor duplicated IRF4 genes. This work describes three IRF4 paralogs from yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco), designated PfIRF4A, PfIRF4B and PfIRF4B-like. These genes all contain a typical IRF structural architecture. Phylogenic and synteny analyses indicate that they should arise from the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. PfIRF4 genes are abundantly expressed in the immune-related tissues and upregulated by PolyI:C, LPS, and Edwardsiella ictaluri. Ectopic expression of these genes inhibits the activation of fish type \u2160 IFN promoters and downregulates the transcription levels of IFN-responsive genes, thus allowing the efficient replication of a fish rhabdovirus, spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). PfIRF4s possess a repressive effect on MyD88-mediated activation of IFN and NF-\u03baB. Some differences are observed between each individual paralog. PfIRF4B is the main form expressed across the tissues and the most up-regulated one after pathogen induction. It exerts a stronger inhibitory effect on IFN antiviral response than the other two paralogs. PfIRF4A and PfIRF4B-like are primarily present in the nucleus, while PfIRF4B displays colocalization and direct associations with MyD88 in the cytoplasm. Overall, the data demonstrate that three PfIRF4 paralogs show shared and individual functional properties in the negative regulation of type \u2160 IFN response.", "Keywords": ["IRF4", "Negative regulator", "Pelteobagrus fulvidraco", "Type \u2160 IFN"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Catfishes", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Fish Proteins", "Fish Diseases", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections", "Interferon Regulatory Factors", "Interferon Type I"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuhan", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingjing", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Yeqing", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China."}, {"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430062, China.

However, few studies have explored whether the impact of the same meteorological factors on the incidence rate of infectious diarrhea in different climate regions has changed and quantified these changes. In this study, the time series fixed-effect Poisson regression model guided by climate was used to quantify the relationships between the incidence rate of various types of infectious diarrhea and meteorological factors in different climate regions of China from 2004 to 2018, with a lag of 0-2 months. In addition, six social factors, including per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population density, number of doctors per 1000 people, proportion of urbanized population, proportion of children aged 0-14 years old, and proportion of elderly over 65 years old, were included in the model for confounding control. Additionally, the intercept of each province in each model was analyzed by a meta-analysis. Four climate regions were considered in this study: tropical monsoon areas, subtropical monsoon areas, temperate areas and alpine plateau areas. The results indicate that the influence of meteorological factors and extreme weather in different climate regions on diverse infectious diarrhea types is distinct. In general, temperature was positively correlated with all infectious diarrhea cases (0.2 \u2264 r \u2264 0.6, p < 0.05). After extreme rainfall, the incidence rate of dysentery in alpine plateau area in one month would be reduced by 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): -27.8--9.6%). Two months after the period of extreme sunshine duration happened, the incidence of dysentery in the alpine plateau area would increase by 21.9% (95% CI: 15.4-28.4%) in that month, and the incidence rate of typhoid and paratyphoid in the temperate region would increase by 17.2% (95% CI: 15.5-18.9%) in that month. The meta-analysis showed that there is no consistency between different provinces in the same climate region.

However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity-based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT.

Inhibition of calpains has been shown to prevent Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced cardiac injuries, but the underlying mechanism of action of calpains has not been elucidated. We investigated whether NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome participated in CVB3-induced myocarditis, and investigated the effects of calpain-1 on CVB3-induced cardiac injury. NLRP3 inflammasome was activated in CVB3-infected hearts, evidenced by elevated protein levels of NLRP3, N-terminal domain of Gasdermin D, and cleaved caspase-1, and the increased co-localization of NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein. The intraperitoneal administration of MCC950, a selective inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, led to decreased levels of serum creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-18, interleukin-1\u03b2, prevention of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and improvement of cardiac function under CVB3 infection. Transgenic mice overexpressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin (Tg-CAST mice) exhibited not only decreased apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and enhanced cardiac function but also inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis. The selective inhibition of calpain-1 using PD151746 protected cardiomyocytes in vitro from CVB3 infection by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and, thus, preserved cell viability. Mechanistically, we showed that mitochondrial dysfunction preceded inflammatory response after CVB3 treatment and elimination of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) using mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (mito-TEMPO) recapitalized the phenotype observed in Tg-CAST mice. Furthermore, the promotion or inhibition of calpain-1 activation in vitro regulated the mitochondrial respiration chain. Mito-TEMPO reversed calpain-1-mediated NLRP3 inflammation activation and cell death. We also found that mitochondrial calpain-1, which was increased after CVB3 stimulation, activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and resulted in cell death. Furthermore, ATP synthase-\u03b1 (ATP5A1) was revealed to be the cleaving target of calpain-1 after CVB3 treatment. Downregulating ATP5A1 using ATP5A1-small interfering RNA impaired mitochondrial function, decreased cell viability, and induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, CVB3 infection induced calpain-1 accumulation in mitochondria, and led to subsequent ATP5A1 cleavage, mitochondrial ROS overproduction, and impaired mitochondrial function, eventually causing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inducing pyroptosis. Therefore, our findings established the role of calpain in viral myocarditis and unveiled its underlying mechanism of its action.

significantly reduces the ApoE \u03b54 risk for Alzheimer's Disease in African Ancestry.", "Abstract": "African descent populations have a lower Alzheimer disease risk from ApoE \u03b54 compared to other populations. Ancestry analysis showed that the difference in risk between African and European populations lies in the ancestral genomic background surrounding the ApoE locus (local ancestry). Identifying the mechanism(s) of this protection could lead to greater insight into the etiology of Alzheimer disease and more personalized therapeutic intervention. Our objective is to follow up the local ancestry finding and identify the genetic variants that drive this risk difference and result in a lower risk for developing Alzheimer disease in African ancestry populations. We performed association analyses using a logistic regression model with the ApoE \u03b54 allele as an interaction term and adjusted for genome-wide ancestry, age, and sex. Discovery analysis included imputed SNP data of 1,850 Alzheimer disease and 4,331 cognitively intact African American individuals. We performed replication analyses on 63 whole genome sequenced Alzheimer disease and 648 cognitively intact Ibadan individuals. Additionally, we reproduced results using whole-genome sequencing of 273 Alzheimer disease and 275 cognitively intact admixed Puerto Rican individuals. A further comparison was done with SNP imputation from an additional 8,463 Alzheimer disease and 11,365 cognitively intact non-Hispanic White individuals. We identified a significant interaction between the ApoE \u03b54 allele and the SNP rs10423769_A allele, (\u03b2 = -0.54,SE = 0.12,p-value = 7.50x10-6) in the discovery data set, and replicated this finding in Ibadan (\u03b2 = -1.32,SE = 0.52,p-value = 1.15x10-2) and Puerto Rican (\u03b2 = -1.27,SE = 0.64,p-value = 4.91x10-2) individuals. The non-Hispanic Whites analyses showed an interaction trending in the \"protective\" direction but failing to pass a 0.05 significance threshold (\u03b2 = -1.51,SE = 0.84,p-value = 7.26x10-2). The presence of the rs10423769_A allele reduces the odds ratio for Alzheimer disease risk from 7.2 for ApoE \u03b54/\u03b54 carriers lacking the A allele to 2.1 for ApoE \u03b54/\u03b54 carriers with at least one A allele. This locus is located approximately 2 mB upstream of the ApoE locus, in a large cluster of pregnancy specific beta-1 glycoproteins on chromosome 19 and lies within a long noncoding RNA, ENSG00000282943. This study identified a new African-ancestry specific locus that reduces the risk effect of ApoE \u03b54 for developing Alzheimer disease. The mechanism of the interaction with ApoE\u03b54 is not known but suggests a novel mechanism for reducing the risk for \u03b54 carriers opening the possibility for potential ancestry-specific therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Apolipoproteins E", "Genotype", "Humans", "Nigeria", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Farid", "Last Name": "Rajabli", "Affiliation": "John P.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high throughput genotyping based on sequencing techniques can increase prediction accuracy. An association mapping panel of 227 Texas elite (TXE) wheat breeding lines was used for GWAS and a training population to develop prediction models for grain yield selection. An imbalanced set of yield data collected from 102 environments (year-by-location) over 10\u00a0years, through testing yield in 40-66 lines each year at 6-14 locations with 38-41 lines repeated in the test in any two consecutive years, was used. Based on correlations among data from different environments within two adjacent years and heritability estimated in each environment, yield data from 87 environments were selected and assigned to two correlation-based groups. The yield best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) from each group, along with reaction to greenbug and Hessian fly in each line, was used for GWAS to reveal genomic regions associated with yield and insect resistance. A total of 74 genomic regions were associated with grain yield and two of them were commonly detected in both correlation-based groups.

The yielded metabolic substrate of d-Ala-TPAPy can be metabolically incorporated into bacterial peptidoglycan to form engineered C. Butyricum. Once the engineered C. butyricum is injected into melanoma, the bacteria can only proliferate in an anaerobic zone, stimulate the tumor immune microenvironment, and ablate the tumor hypoxia region. Following that, the relatively rich oxygen content in the peripheral area can induce the death of C. butyricum.

However, whether blood cells with CHIP mutations play a causal role in promoting the development of solid tumors remained unclear. Using conditional knock-in mice that express CHIP-associated mutant Asxl1 (Asxl1-MT), we showed that expression of Asxl1-MT in T cells, but not in myeloid cells, promoted solid-tumor progression in syngeneic transplantation models. We also demonstrated that Asxl1-MT-expressing blood cells accelerated the development of spontaneous mammary tumors induced by MMTV-PyMT. Intratumor analysis of the mammary tumors revealed the reduced T-cell infiltration at tumor sites and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) upregulation in CD8+ T cells in MMTV-PyMT/Asxl1-MT mice. In addition, we found that Asxl1-MT induced T-cell dysregulation, including aberrant intrathymic T-cell development, decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, and na\u00efve-memory imbalance in peripheral T cells.

We obtained the expression profiles of ESCC from public data (GSE53625) and extracted the portion of ARGs. Differential expression analysis and enrichment analysis were performed to confirm abnormal autophagy-related biological functions. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed on RNA microarray data (GSE53625) to construct a prognostic risk signature associated with autophagy. The performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, survival analysis and Brier score. The model was subjected to bootstrap internal validation. The potential molecular mechanism of gene signature was explored by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Spearman correlation coefficient examined the correlation between risk score and immune status and ferroptosis. The expression levels of genes and proteins were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in ESCC cell lines and ESCC tissues. We constructed and validated an autophagy-related prognostic risk signature in 179 patients with ESCC. The long-term survival of patients in high-risk group was lower than that in low-risk group (log-rank, P value\u2009<\u20090.001). ROC analysis and Brier score confirmed the reliability of the signature. GSEA results showed significant enrichment of cancer- and autophagy-related signaling pathways in the high-risk ESCC patients and immunoregulatory signaling pathways in the low-risk ESCC patients. Correlation analysis showed that the risk signature can effectively predict the effect of immunotherapy. About 33.97% (71/209) ferroptosis-related genes were significantly correlated with risk scores. Finally, the results of qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry experiments were consistent with bioinformatics analysis.

It has often been a challenge to analyze these types of glycans, including those that are differentiated by the incorporation of N-acetyl (NANA) and N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NGNA) residues. In this study, a strategy for rapid N-glycan profiling by mixed mode chromatography is proposed as a complement to established HILIC methodologies. Hybrid silica chromatographic surfaces are used to improve recoveries during a column's initial use and to eliminate the need for column conditioning. In addition, the loss of labeled acidic glycans, especially phosphorylated glycan species, during SPE purification is addressed through the use of a citrate containing eluent. Yields for both singly and doubly phosphorylated glycan species are markedly improved. Combined with a mixed mode anion exchange reversed phase separation, these advances afford a class separation of glycans derivatized with labels designed to enhance positive ion mode MS detection. These labeled glycan species are separated according to their charge and with an added level of resolution imparted by the reversed phase retention mechanism. The separation technique itself can be accomplished with a low ionic strength gradient running from 0 to 22\u00a0mM ammonium formate such that high sensitivity detection can be achieved by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry. Using analytical scale chromatography, features in an N-glycan profile were easily interrogated to well below a 0.1% relative abundance.

However, studies on rural-urban differences in associations between hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases and air pollution are limited. The generalized linear model (GLM) was applied to investigate the associations between cardiovascular hospitalizations and air pollution (SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and O3) in Guangxi, southwest China, in 2015 (January 1-December 31). The relative risk of pollutants (SO2, NO2) on cardiovascular hospital admissions was significantly different between urban and rural areas. The effect of SO2 on cardiovascular hospitalizations was higher in urban areas than in rural areas at lag0 to lag3 and cumulative lag01 to lag03. In urban areas, there were positive associations between NO2 and cardiovascular hospitalizations at lag0, lag1 and cumulative lag01, lag02. In contrast, the effect of NO2 on cardiovascular hospitalizations was not significant in rural areas. Urban residents were more sensitive than rural residents to SO2 and NO2. Subgroup analyses showed statistically significant differences between rural and urban areas in the association between SO2 and NO2 and cardiovascular hospitalizations for males. For age groups, people aged \u2265 65 years appeared to be more vulnerable to SO2 and NO2 in urban areas. The effects of PM2.5 PM10, CO, and O3 on cardiovascular hospitalizations were consistently negative for all groups. Our findings indicated that there were rural-urban differences in associations between cardiovascular hospitalizations and air pollutants. In rural areas, the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations was mainly influenced by SO2. Therefore, we expect to pay attention to protecting people from air pollution, particularly for those aged \u2265 65 years in urban areas.", "Keywords": ["Air pollution factor", "Cardiovascular hospitalizations", "GLM", "Relative risk", "Rural-urban differences", "Southwest China"], "MeSH terms": ["Air Pollutants", "Air Pollution", "China", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Male", "Nitrogen Dioxide", "Particulate Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guangli", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary AQ2, Calgary, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Shiyan", "Last Name": "Zhai", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China. zsycenu@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Genxin", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongquan", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Lizhong", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, 524001, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunfeng", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinxin", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, Henan, China."}], "Journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "35071412", "Title": "Concurrence and impact of hepatic steatosis on chronic hepatitis B patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "The association between hepatic steatosis (HS) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains controversial.

Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced liver injury was investigated in the study. Different from the caspase-dependent cell apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide/D-aminogalactose (LPS/D-GalN) induced liver injury, ConA-induced hepatocyte death was independent on caspase. Increased hepatocytic expressions of mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL) and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and higher serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were noticed in mice with ConA-induced liver injury. Inhibition of RIPK1 protein or deletion of MLKL gene could significantly attenuate the acute liver injury and improve mice survival. Besides, the ConA treatment induced severe hepatic inflammation in wide type (WT) mice in comparison with Mlkl-/- mice, suggesting the RIPK1-MLKL-mediated hepatocellular necroptosis might participate in the process of liver injury. Moreover, mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) were subsequently released after the hepatocyte death, and further activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which could be reduced by deletion or inhibition of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Taken together, our research revealed that ConA-induced acute liver injury was closely related to TNF-\u03b1-mediated cell necroptosis, and inhibiting RIPK1 or deleting MLKL gene could alleviate liver injury in mice.

The active component compound of Epimedii Folium, Astragali Radix, and Puerariae Lobatae Radix(YHG) can regulate the expression of iron metabolism-related proteins to inhibit brain iron overload and relieve hypofunction of central nervous system in AD patients. Hepcidin is an important target regulating iron metabolism. This study investigated the effect of YHG on the expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17(ADAM17), a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of \u03b2 amyloid precursor protein(APP) in HT22 cells, by mediating hepcidin. To be specific, HT22 cells were cultured in vitro, followed by liposome-mediated siRNA transfection to silence the expression of hepcidin. Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to examine the silencing result and the effect of YHG on hepcidin in AD cell model. HT22 cells were randomized into 7 groups: control group, A\u03b225-35 induction(A\u03b2) group, hepcidin-siRNA(siRNA) group, A\u03b225-35 + hepcidin-siRNA(A\u03b2 + siRNA) group, A\u03b225-35+YHG(A\u03b2+YHG) group, hepcidin-siRNA+YHG(siRNA+YHG) group, A\u03b225-35+hepcidin-siRNA+YHG(A\u03b2+siRNA+YHG) group. The expression of ADAM17 mRNA in cells was detected by real-time PCR, and the expression of ADAM17 protein by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Immunofluorescence showed that the ADAM17 protein expression was lower in the A\u03b2 group, siRNA group, and A\u03b2+siRNA group than in the control group(P&lt;0.05) and the expression was lower in the A\u03b2+siRNA group(P&lt;0.05) and higher in the A\u03b2+YHG group(P&lt;0.05) than in the A\u03b2 group.

Interestingly, myeloma cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and folate receptor expression levels are higher in chemotherapy-resistant patients than in pretreatment patients. In this study, a multifunctional folic acid (FA)-targeting core-shell structure is presented for simultaneous delivery of shMCL-1 and paclitaxel (PTX). The transfection efficiency of shMCL-1 with the FA-targeting delivery system is higher than with a nontargeting delivery system in Skov3 and A2780T cells. The FA-targeting system significantly inhibits cell growth, blocks cell cycles, and promotes apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro. The mechanisms involved in inhibiting growth are related to Bcl-2/Bax and cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathways. An analysis of RNA sequencing suggests that shMCL-1 reverses chemoresistance through regulating genes such as regulator of chromosome condensation 2 (RCC2). The synergetic effect of shMCL-1 and PTX effectively inhibits tumor growth in both PTX-resistant and normal cancer models by inducing tumor apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, and limiting tumor angiogenesis. The study results indicate that a FA-targeting delivery system combining shMCL-1 with PTX can simultaneously target tumor sites and restore the sensitivity of chemotherapy-resistant cancer to PTX.

Neuronal activity in the tumor microenvironment can promote the growth and expansion of glioma. There is increasing evidence that in addition to their use in the treatment of mental disorders, antipsychotic, antidepressant, and mood-stabilizing drugs have clinical potential for cancer therapy. These drugs have been shown to inhibit the malignant progression of glioma by targeting signaling pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, or invasion/migration or by increasing the sensitivity of glioma cells to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this review, we summarize findings from preclinical and clinical studies investigating the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers in the treatment of various types of cancer, with a focus on glioma; and discuss their presumed antitumor mechanisms.

The risk of influenza cases reached a peak at -5.35 \u00b0C with RRs of 2.14 (95%CI: 1.38-3.33) and the monthly AT in the range of -5.35 \u00b0C to 18.31 \u00b0C had significant effects on the incidence of influenza. Every degree that the weekly AT rose, the positive rate of A/H1N1 decreased by 5.28% (95%CI: 0.35%-9.96%). The risk of A/H1N1 reached a peak at -3.14 \u00b0C with RRs of 4.88 (95%CI: 1.01-23.75) and the weekly AT in the range of -3.14 \u00b0C to 17.25 \u00b0C had significant effects on the incidence of influenza. Our study found that AT is negatively associated with influenza activity, especially for A/H1N1. These findings indicate that temperature could be integrated into the current influenza surveillance system to develop early warning systems to better predict and prepare for the risks of influenza.",

However, serious pharmacological and technical obstacles, some of which are unique to defensins and others are common to peptide drugs in general, have hindered the development and clinical translation of defensins as anti-infective therapeutics. To overcome them, several technologies have been developed, aiming for improved functionality, prolonged circulation time, enhanced proteolytic stability and bioavailability, and efficient and controlled delivery and release of defensins to the site of infection. Additional challenges include the alleviation of potential toxicity of defensins and their cost-effective manufacturing.

Resveratrol (REV) exerts beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. Our aim is to clarify the involvement of liver metabolic reprogramming and the atheroprotective effects of REV. Methods: ApoE-deficient mice were administered with normal diet (N), high-fat diet (H), or HFD with REV (HR). Twenty-four weeks after treatment, Oil Red O staining was used to assess the severity of AS. Non-targeted metabolomics was employed to obtain metabolic signatures of the liver from different groups. Results: High-fat diet-induced AS was alleviated by REV, with less lipid accumulation in the lesions. The metabolic profiles of liver tissues from N, H, and HR groups were analyzed. A total of 1,146 and 765 differentially expressed features were identified between N and H groups, and H and HR groups, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis uncovered several metabolism-related pathways, which are potential pathogenesis mechanisms and therapeutic targets including \"primary bile acid biosynthesis,\" \"phenylalanine metabolism,\" and \"glycerophospholipid metabolism.\" We further conducted trend analysis using 555 metabolites with one-way ANOVA, where p < 0.05 and PLS-DA VIP >1. We found that REV could reverse the detrimental effect of high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. These metabolites were enriched in pathways including \"biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids\" and \"intestinal immune network for IgA production.\" The metabolites involved in these pathways could be the potential biomarkers for AS-related liver metabolic reprogramming and the mechanism of REV treatment.

A panel threshold model is constructed to explore the non-linear relationship between FDI and carbon emissions performance from the perspective of marketization level.

Second, as the marketization level increases, the technology spillover effect of FDI increases, and the stimulation effect of foreign participation on carbon intensity decreases significantly, but it does not inhibit carbon intensity, indicating that the overall benefits brought by FDI technology spillovers are still insufficient to offset pollution caused by foreign investment. Third, the eastern region of the Yangtze River Economic Belt has crossed the second threshold. In the central and western regions, the marketization process is relatively slow except for Chongqing, and the regions are still firmly stuck between the first and second thresholds.

Circ-SNRK can sponge the miR-33 and in turn improved the ATP synthesis via SNRK, proving the existence of circ-SNRK - miR-33 - SNRK axis.

The aforementioned negative feedback of SNRK to circ-SNRK limited the SNRK at a proper level, and inhibited the protective role of circ-SNRK in ischemic heart. In addition, our in vivo experiment indicated that the overexpression of exogenic circ-SNRK could break this loop and improves the cardiac function post-MI in rats.

However, it may require a certain time before surgery for various reasons. There are concerns that the delay in surgery may affect postoperative outcomes. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of surgical wait time on survival in patients with T3 RCC. Methods: We retrospectively selected 138 patients with T3 RCC who underwent radical surgery between July 2009 and December 2019. Surgical wait time was defined as the period from initial imaging diagnosis to surgery. Patients were divided into the following 2 groups according to wait time: short-wait group(\u226460 days), and long-wait group (>60 days). The clinical and pathological characteristics were evaluated. The overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of each group were calculated and compared. Age, gender, interval, tumor size, pathological grade, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), surgical approach, year of surgery, and pathological type were included in the multivariable model. Results: This study included 91 male (65.9%) and 47 female (34.1%) patients. The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 52-68 years). The median body mass index is 22.2\u2005kg/m2 (IQR 18.9-24.7\u2005 kg/m2). There were 128 patients (92.8%) with pT3a disease and 10 patients (7.3%) with pT3b disease. The median surgical wait time for all patients was 16 days (IQR 10-77 days). The median surgical wait time of the short- and long-wait groups was 12 days (IQR 8-16 days) and 92 days (IQR 79-115 days), respectively. Until the last follow-up, 54 patients died. Among them, 49 patients (90.7%) died of tumor-related causes, and 5 patients (9.3%) died of other causes. There are 1 and 4 cases in the short-wait and long-wait groups, respectively.

However, little evidence exists regarding the synergy between gaseous pollutants and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of individual gaseous pollutants on hospital admissions for CVD and to explore the possible synergistic effects between gaseous pollutants. Daily hospitalization counts for CVD were collected from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. We also collected daily time series on gaseous pollutants from the Environment of the People's Republic of China, including NO2, SO2, and O3. We used distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) to assess the association of individual gaseous pollutants on CVD hospitalization, after controlling for seasonality, day of the week, public holidays, and weather variables. Then, we explored the variability across age and sex groups. In addition, we analyzed the synergistic effects between gaseous pollutants on CVD. Extremely low NO2 and SO2 increase the risk of CVD in all subgroup at lag 7 days. The greatest effect of high concentration of SO2 was observed in male and the elderly (\u2265 65 years) at lag 3 days. Greater effects of high concentration of O3 were more pronounced in the young (< 65 years) and female at lag 3 days, while the effect of low concentration of O3 was greater in male and the young (< 65 years) at lag 0 day. We found a synergistic effect between NO2 and SO2 for CVD, as well as between SO2 and O3. The synergistic effects of NO2 and SO2 on CVD were stronger in the elderly (\u2265 65) and female. The female was sensitive to synergistic effects of SO2-O3 and NO2-O3.

In this study, we applied genomic prediction in the breeding of cucumber plants. Eighty-one cucumber inbred lines were genotyped and 16,662 markers were identified to represent the genetic background of cucumber. Two populations, namely, diallel cross population and North Carolina II population, having 268 combinations in total were constructed from 81 inbred lines. Twelve cucumber commercial traits of these two populations in autumn 2018, spring 2019, and spring 2020 were collected for model training. General combining ability (GCA) models under five-fold cross-validation and cross-population validation were applied to model validation. Finally, the GCA performance of 81 inbred lines was estimated. Our results showed that the predictive ability for 12 traits ranged from 0.38 to 0.95 under the cross-validation strategy and ranged from -0.38 to 0.88 under the cross-population strategy. Besides, GCA models containing non-additive effects had significantly better performance than the pure additive GCA model for most of the investigated traits. Furthermore, there were a relatively higher proportion of additive-by-additive genetic variance components estimated by the full GCA model, especially for lower heritability traits, but the proportion of dominant genetic variance components was relatively small and stable. Our findings concluded that a genomic prediction protocol based on the GCA model theoretical framework can be applied to cucumber breeding, and it can also provide a reference for the single-cross breeding system of other crops.", "Keywords": ["GBLUP", "bayesian ridge regression", "cucumber breeding", "genomic prediction", "model validation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ce", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Yike", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetable Germplasm Innovation, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Vegetable Breeding Enterprise, Cucumber Research Institute, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi'ao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Huanwen", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhihui", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in plant science", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34458145", "Title": "Fatty Acid Metabolism-Related lncRNAs Are Potential Biomarkers for Predicting the Overall Survival of Patients With Colorectal Cancer.", "Abstract": "Abnormal metabolism, including abnormal fatty acid metabolism, is an emerging hallmark of cancer. The current study sought to investigate the potential prognostic value of fatty acid metabolism-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC). To this end, we obtained the gene expression data and clinical data of patients with CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Through gene set variation analysis (GSVA), we found that the fatty acid metabolism pathway was related to the clinical stage and prognosis of patients with CRC. After screening differentially expressed RNAs, we constructed a fatty acid metabolism-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on the miRTarBase, miRDB, TargetScan, and StarBase databases. Next, eight fatty acid metabolism-related lncRNAs included in the ceRNA network were identified to build a prognostic signature with Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses, and a nomogram was established based on the lncRNA signature and clinical variables. The signature and nomogram were further validated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression analysis, calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA). Besides, the TCGA internal and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) external cohorts were applied to successfully validate the robustness of the signature and nomogram. Finally, in vitro assays showed that knockdown of prognostic lncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 decreased the triglyceride (TG) content and the expressions of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) in CRC cells, which indicated the important role of lncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 in modulating fatty acid metabolism of CRC. The result of Oil Red O staining showed that the lipid content in lncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 high expression group was higher than that in lncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 low expression group.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the impact of hepatic encephalopathy on clinical characteristics and adverse outcomes in prospective and multicenter cohorts of patients with acute-on-chronic liver diseases. Design: We conducted a cohort study of two multicenter prospective cohorts. Setting: China. Participants: Acute-on-chronic liver disease patients with various etiologies. Exposure: The diagnosis and severity of hepatic encephalopathy were assessed using the West Haven scale. Main Outcome Measure: The correlation between clinical adverse outcomes and varying hepatic encephalopathy grades was analyzed in the target patients. Results: A total of 3,949 patients were included, and 340 of them had hepatic encephalopathy. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was higher in patients with alcohol consumption (9.90%) than in those with hepatitis B virus infection (6.17%). The incidence of 28- and 90-day adverse outcomes increased progressively from hepatic encephalopathy grades 1-4. Logistic regression analysis revealed that hepatic encephalopathy grades 3 and 4 were independent risk factors for the 28- and 90-day adverse outcome in the fully adjusted model IV. Stratified analyses showed similar results in the different subgroups. Compared to grades 1-2 and patients without hepatic encephalopathy, those with grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy had a significant increase in clinical adverse outcomes, independent of other organ failures. Conclusions and Relevance: Hepatic encephalopathy grades 3-4 were independent risk factors for 28- and 90-day adverse outcomes.

It has posed a great threat to public health of all age groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological trends and hotspots of OID in mainland China. Materials and Methods: Incidence and mortality data for OID stratified by date, age and region from 2004 to 2017 was extracted from the data-center of China public health science. Joinpoint regression and space-time analyses were performed to explore the epidemiological trends and hotspots of OID. Results: The average annual incidence of OID was 60.64/100,000 and it showed an increased trend in the mainland China especially after 2006 (APC = 4.12, 95 CI%: 2.06-6.21). Children of 0-4 year age group accounts for 60.00% (5,820,897/11,414,247) of all cases and its incidence continuously increased though 2004-2017 (APC = 6.65, 95 CI%: 4.39-8.96).

suppressing mitochondrial fission in acute viral myocarditis.", "Abstract": "Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is critical for the development of viral myocarditis (VMC), which is one of the leading causes of cardiac sudden death in young adults. Our previous studies have demonstrated that elevated calpain activity is involved in the pathogenesis of VMC. This study aimed to further explore the underlying mechanisms. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and transgenic mice overexpressing calpastatin were infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to establish a VMC model. Apoptosis was detected with flow cytometry, TUNEL staining, and western blotting. Cardiac function was measured using echocardiography. Mitochondrial function was measured using ATP assays, JC-1, and MitoSOX. Mitochondrial morphology was observed using MitoTracker staining and transmission electron microscopy. Colocalization of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) in mitochondria was examined using immunofluorescence. Phosphorylation levels of Drp-1 at Ser637 site\u00a0were determined using western blotting analysis. We found that CVB3 infection impaired mitochondrial function as evidenced by increased mitochondrial ROS production, decreased ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, induced myocardial apoptosis and damage, and decreased myocardial function. These effects of CVB3 infection were attenuated by inhibition of calpain both by PD150606 treatment and calpastatin overexpression. Furthermore, CVB3-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with the accumulation of Drp-1 in the outer membrane of mitochondria and subsequent increase in mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, calpain cleaved and activated calcineurin A, which dephosphorylated Drp-1 at Ser637 site\u00a0and promoted its accumulation in the mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. In summary, calpain inhibition attenuated CVB3-induced myocarditis by reducing mitochondrial fission, thereby inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Calpain is activated by CVB3 infection. Activated calpain cleaves calcineurin A and converts it to active form which could dephosphorylate Drp-1 at Ser637\u00a0site. Then, the active Drp-1 translocates from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and triggers excessive mitochondrial fission. Eventually, the balance of mitochondrial dynamics is broken, and apoptosis occurs.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "Calpain", "Dynamin-related protein 1", "Mitochondria", "Viral myocarditis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Calcineurin", "Calpain", "Coxsackievirus Infections", "Mice", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Myocarditis", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of General Practice, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Minghui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Yucheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunzeng", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Ruizhen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China. chen.ruizhen@zs-hospital.sh.cn."}, {"First Name": "Junbo", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, 200030, China."}], "Journal": "Cell biology and toxicology", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "34336751", "Title": "Study on Environmental and Lifestyle Factors for the North-South Differential of Cardiovascular Disease in China.", "Abstract": "Human death and life span are closely related to the geographical environment and regional lifestyle.

Low MKRN3 expression levels correlate with poor patient survival. Reconstitution of MKRN3 in MKRN3-inactivated NSCLC cells directly abrogates in vitro and in vivo tumor growth and proliferation. MKRN3 knockout mice are susceptible to urethane-induced lung cancer, and lung cell-specific knockout of endogenous MKRN3 accelerates NSCLC tumorigenesis in vivo. A mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen identified PABPC1 as a major substrate for MKRN3. The tumor suppressor function of MKRN3 is dependent on its E3 ligase activity, and MKRN3 missense mutations identified in patients substantially compromise MKRN3-mediated PABPC1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, MKRN3 modulates cell proliferation through PABPC1 nonproteolytic ubiquitination and subsequently, PABPC1-mediated global protein synthesis.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the role and mechanism of PARP1 in the development of MIRI. Firstly, we demonstrated that PARP1 was activated during MIRI-induced myocardial autophagy in vitro. Moreover, PARP1 inhibition protected cardiomyocytes from MIRI through the inhibition of autophagy. Next, we discovered that specificity protein1 (Sp1), as a transcription factor of PARP1, regulates its target gene PARP1 through binding to its target gene promoter during transcription. Furthermore, silencing Sp1 protected cardiomyocytes from MIRI via the inhibition of PARP1. Finally, the functions and mechanisms of PARP1 in the development of MIRI were also verified in vivo with SD rats model. Based on these findings, we concluded that PARP1 inhibition protects cardiomyocytes from MIRI through the inhibition of autophagy, which is targeted by Sp1 suppression.

To address these issues, we developed a chromatographic device with an optimized form factor and stationary phase to improve protein recovery, while reducing run times. We have observed that by using this device, it is possible to achieve attomole quantitation of mAbs without the addition of carrier proteins and with over three-fold higher throughput than columns employed in previous studies. Moreover, we have devised a novel affinity capture method, based on repurposing a unique aptamer ligand that can give 93% recovery of mAb using only a 2\u00a0h incubation.

However, the mechanism of its action remains elusive and the direct target proteins of ISO have not been identified so far. Through cell-based screening, we identified ISO as a potent lipid-lowering compound. ISO treatment successfully ameliorated fatty acid-induced cellular lipid accumulation and improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by increasing PPAR\u03b1-dependent lipid oxidation and decreasing SREBPs-dependent lipid synthesis. Both these signaling required the activation of SIRT1. Knockdown of SIRT1 resulted in the reversal of ISO beneficiary effects suggesting that the lipid-lowering activity of ISO was regulated by SIRT1 expression. To identify the direct target of ISO, limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry (LiP-SMap) strategy was applied and IQGAP2 was identified as the direct target for ISO in regulating lipid homeostasis. In the presence of ISO, both mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 were increased; however, this effect was abolished by blocking IQGAP2 expression using siRNA. To explore how IQGAP2 regulated the expression level of SIRT1, proteome profiler human phospho-kinase array kit was used to reveal possible phosphorylated kinases and signaling nodes that ISO affected. We found that through phosphorylation of CREB, ISO transduced signals from IQGAP2 to upregulate SIRT1 expression. Thus, we not only demonstrated the molecular basis of ISO in regulating lipid metabolism but also exhibited for the first time a novel IQGAP2-CREB-SIRT1 axis in treating NAFLD/NASH.", "Keywords": ["CREB", "IQGAP2", "SIRT1", "isoliquiritigenin", "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chalcones", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Lipid Metabolism", "Liver", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Sirtuin 1", "ras GTPase-Activating Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Sheng-Ye", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng-Rong", "Last Name": "Qi-Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Xiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Tao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Pingping", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}], "Journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "PubDate": "2021Jul"}, {"PMID": "33859936", "Title": "Safety of Prolonged Wait Time for Nephrectomy for Clinically Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma.", "Abstract": "There is usually a surgical wait time before nephrectomy for patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma, and many factors can influence this preoperative wait time.

Polyclonal emergence of KIT/PDGFRA secondary mutations is the main mechanism of imatinib progression, making it challenging to overcome KIT/PDGFRA-inhibitor resistance. It is unclear whether there are other therapeutic targets in advanced GIST. Using genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of advanced versus early-stage GIST and CRISPR knockout functional screens, we demonstrate that CDK1 is frequently highly expressed in advanced GIST but not in early-stage GIST across three patient cohorts. High expression of CDK1 was associated with malignancy in GIST. CDK1 was critically required for advanced GIST, including imatinib-resistant GIST. CDK1 ablation led to robust proliferation inhibition. A mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen further revealed that AKT is a novel substrate of CDK1 kinase in GIST. CDK1 bound AKT and regulated its phosphorylation, thereby promoting GIST proliferation and progression. Importantly, a pharmacologic inhibitor of CDK1, RO-3306, disrupted GIST cell proliferation in CDK1 highly expressed GIST but not in CDK1-negative GIST cells and nontransformed fibroblast cells. Treatment with RO-3306 reduced tumor growth in both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive GIST xenograft mouse models. Our findings suggest that CDK1 represents a druggable therapeutic target in GIST and warrants further testing in clinical trials.

Xenogeneic silencing is crucial to ensure the safe acquisition of LGT genes into host pre-existing regulatory networks. We previously found that the host nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) silences prophage CP4So at warm temperatures yet enables this prophage to excise at cold temperatures in Shewanella oneidensis. However, whether H-NS silences other genes and how bacteria modulate H-NS to regulate the expression of genes have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we discovered that the H-NS silences many LGT genes and the xenogeneic silencing of H-NS relies on a temperature-dependent phosphorylation at warm temperatures in S. oneidensis. Specifically, phosphorylation of H-NS at Ser42 is critical for silencing the cold-inducible genes including the excisionase of CP4So prophage, a cold shock protein, and a stress-related chemosensory system. By contrast, nonphosphorylated H-NS derepresses the promoter activity of these genes/operons to enable their expression at cold temperatures. Taken together, our results reveal that the posttranslational modification of H-NS can function as a regulatory switch to control LGT gene expression in host genomes to enable the host bacterium to react and thrive when environmental temperature changes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Cold Shock Proteins and Peptides", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Gene Silencing", "Gene

The aim of the study was to assess a new ARMS-PCR test for detection of H. pylori clarithromycin resistance (CR) and quinolone resistance (QR) mutations and evaluate the spectrum of antibiotic resistance in patients from three Chinese provinces. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ARMS-PCR were used to detect H. pylori CR and QR bacteria in gastric biopsy samples. Among the 1,182 patients enrolled with gastritis, 643 (54.4%) were positive for H. pylori. Of these, 371 (57.7%) had antibiotic-resistant strains, comprising 236 (63.6%) with a single drug antibiotic-resistant strain and 135 (36.4%) with multiple drug-resistant strains. Following Sanger sequencing analysis of 23S rRNA and gyrA gene for mutations (antibiotic resistance markers), rates of CR, QR, and multidrug resistance (CR and QR) were 19.9, 12.0, and 25.8%, respectively. The 23S rRNA CR mutation A2143G (286, 96.9%) and the gyrA QR mutations C261A (85, 31.5%) and G271A (71, 26.3%) were common.

Worryingly, the consumption of MAD-contaminated crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) may induce symptoms of Haff disease. In this study, to monitor this potential contamination and to understand the residue and elimination characteristics of MAD in edible tissues of crayfish, a sensitive and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed, validated, and applied. After extraction with acetonitrile and purification by solid-phase extraction column, multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry with positive ionization mode was used to determine MAD's residues. The limits of detection and of quantification were 6 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1 and 20 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1, respectively. The fortified recoveries ranged from 74.2% to 110.4%, with relative standard deviation of 1.2% to 10.1%. Furthermore, MAD was completely eliminated after 3 and 5 days from abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas tissues of crayfish, respectively. The maximum residue limits (MRLs) of MAD respectively was 200 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1 in muscle and 600 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1 in the hepatopancreas, and its withdrawal time in both edible tissues was 25.8 \u00b0C\u00b7d.

To understand the potential ecological toxicity of maduramicin on aquatic organisms, acute and subacute toxicity, hemolymph biochemistry, histopathology and the expressions of drug metabolism and stress response genes of crayfish (Procambius clarkii) were investigated in this study. For the first time, the 96\u00a0h median lethal concentration (LC50) of maduramicin on crayfish was 67.03\u00a0mgL-1 with a 95% confidence interval (54.06-81.32\u00a0mgL-1). Then, the crayfish were exposed to 0.7\u00a0mgL-1 (1/100 LC50), 3.5\u00a0mgL-1 (1/20 LC50) and 7.0\u00a0mgL-1 (1/10 LC50) maduramicin for 28 days. Maduramicin significantly altered biochemical parameters including AST, ALT, CK, LDH and ALP of hemolymph in crayfish at several time points. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) of crayfish gills, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle were significantly decreased or elevated by different concentrations of maduramicin treatment at varying time points. Furthermore, histopathological damage of crayfish gills, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle were observed in a concentration-dependent manner. The expressions of metabolic and stress response genes (CYP450, GST, COX1, COX2, HSP70 and MT) in hepatopancreas of crayfish were significantly up-regulated by maduramicin (7.0\u00a0mgL-1) treatment for 8\u00a0h to 7 d, and returned to normal levels after the removal of maduramicin for 3-7 days.

However, a TMUV-caused neurological disease has also been found in ducklings below 7 weeks of age, highlighting the need to develop a safe vaccine for young ducklings. In this study, a plaque-purified PS TMUV strain was attenuated by serial passage in BHK-21 cells. Using 1-day-old Pekin ducklings as a model, the virus was confirmed to be attenuated sufficiently after 180 passages, whereas the neutralizing antibody response elicited by the 180th passage virus (PS180) was substantially impaired compared with PS. The findings suggest that sufficient attenuation results in loss of immunogenicity in the development of the live-attenuated TMUV vaccine. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that PS180 acquired one mutation (V41M) in prM and four mutations (T70A, Y176H, K313R, and F408L) in the envelope (E) protein. To identify the amino acid substitution(s) associated with loss of immunogenicity of PS180, we rescued parental viruses, rPS and rPS180, and produced mutant viruses, rPS180-M41V, rPS180-A70T, rPS180-H176Y, rPS180-R313K, rPS180-L408F, and rPS180-M5, which contained residue 41V in prM, residues 70T, 176Y, 313K, and 408F in E, and combination of the five residues, respectively, of PS in the backbone of the rPS180 genome. The neutralizing antibody response elicited by rPS180-L408F and rPS180-M5 was significantly higher than those by other mutant viruses and comparable to that by rPS. Furthermore, we produced mutant virus rPS-F408L, which contained residue 408L of PS180 in the backbone of the rPS genome. The F408L mutation conferred significantly decreased neutralizing antibody response to rPS-F408L, which was comparable to that elicited by rPS180. Based on homologous modeling, residue 408 was predicted to be located within the first helical domain of the stem region of the E protein (EH1). Together, these data demonstrate that a single mutation within the EH1 domain exerts a dramatical impact on the TMUV neutralizing antibody response. The present work may enhance our understanding of molecular basis of the TMUV neutralizing antibody response, and provides an important step for the development of a safe and efficient live-attenuated TMUV vaccine.", "Keywords": ["Tembusu virus", "attenuation", "duck", "envelope protein", "neutralizing antibody", "stem region"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junfeng", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shulin", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Lixin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shenghua", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Runze", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Baolin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Chonglun", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Dabing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33165811", "Title": "Sodium cantharidinate, a novel anti-pancreatic cancer agent that activates functional p53.", "Abstract": "Despite the use of many types of chemotherapies for pancreatic cancer, optimal efficacy has not been obtained so far. Pancreatic cancer shows a high incidence of TP53 mutations, inactivating its tumor suppressor activity. In this study, we identified sodium cantharidinate as a novel, potential anti-pancreatic cancer agent that activates p53 function. Sodium cantharidinate reduced the viability of pancreatic cancer cells, including the human primary pancreatic cancer cells, PANC-1, AsPC-1, SW1990 and BXPC-3, in a dose-dependent manner. Sodium cantharidinate induced apoptosis and DNA damage of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, proteome-wide sequencing analysis detected a marked perturbation in p53 signaling pathway on PANC-1 cells upon sodium cantharidinate. Consistent with the previous results, sodium cantharidinate treatment decreased Bcl-2 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c protein expression, as well as phosphorylation of MDM2; meanwhile, it increased the levels of cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-PARP, Bax, and phosphorylated p53, thus inducing the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. The p53-activating effect of sodium cantharidinate was strongly abrogated by treatment with TP53-targeting shRNA. Moreover, sodium cantharidinate inhibited neoplasm growth via the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, which was inhibited by shRNA-TP53 and triggered by combination with gemcitabine. Combination therapy indicated that sodium cantharidinate and gemcitabine synergistically reduced ex vivo and in vivo growth of pancreatic neoplasm. Further docking studies revealed the different binding fates of sodium cantharidinate to activate wild-type p53 function. Thus, sodium cantharidinate could be a potential agent with promising anti-pancreatic cancer efficacy.", "Keywords": ["JAK2-STAT3", "apoptosis", "p53", "pancreatic cancers"], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Cantharidin", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Synergism", "Humans", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Proteomics", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Pyone Myat", "Last Name": "Thu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenjian", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China."}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China. liping@cpu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China. xiaojunxu@cpu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Science China.

The model and its individual lncRNAs differentiated survival probability between the higher scores (expression) and the lower scores (expression).

In the model, the governing equations of beam motion and output voltage are derived in the theoretical way, such that the voltage across the PVDF layer and the cantilever deflection can be predicted. The motion of the beam is described by the multi-mode vibration model through which more accurate results can be obtained. The predicted results of the model are validated by the experiment. Combined with the experiment and the model, the effect of surface wettability on droplet-substrate interaction mechanisms is investigated, which provides an insight into the improvement of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency in raindrop energy harvesting (REH) applications. Results show: (1) the droplet splash on a super-hydrophobic beam surface has a positive effect on voltage generation. The splash limit that affects the reaction force of the impacting droplet is experimentally determined and greatly dominant by the Weber number. (2) Small-scaled droplets in splash regime allow generating higher voltage output from a super-hydrophobic beam surface than from an untreated hydrophilic beam surface. (3) Tests of successive droplet impacts also show that a super-hydrophobic surface performs better over a hydrophilic surface by producing constant peak voltage and higher electrical energy harvested. In this case, the voltage measured from the hydrophilic surface decreases gradually as the water layer is accumulated. Overall, the electromechanical behaviors of a super-hydrophobic PVDF cantilever sensor can be well predicted by the model which shows a great potential in energy harvesting by maximizing the inelastic collision upon droplet-substrate interactions.", "Keywords": ["PVDF cantilever sensor", "droplet splash", "droplet-substrate interactions", "electromechanical model", "multi-mode vibration model", "surface wettability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guannan", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), 66 Changjiang Rd, Huangdao District, Qingdao 266580, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiangwei", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), 66 Changjiang Rd, Huangdao District, Qingdao 266580, China."}, {"First Name": "Zengliang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), 66 Changjiang Rd, Huangdao District, Qingdao 266580, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), 66 Changjiang Rd, Huangdao District, Qingdao 266580, China."}], "Journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2020Oct12"}, {"PMID": "33045733", "Title": "Novel polyadenylylation-dependent neutralization mechanism of the HEPN/MNT toxin/antitoxin system.", "Abstract": "The two-gene module HEPN/MNT is predicted to be the most abundant toxin/antitoxin (TA) system in prokaryotes. However, its physiological function and neutralization mechanism remains obscure. Here, we discovered that the MntA antitoxin (MNT-domain protein) acts as an adenylyltransferase and chemically modifies the HepT toxin (HEPN-domain protein) to block its toxicity as an RNase. Biochemical and structural studies revealed that MntA mediates the transfer of three AMPs to a tyrosine residue next to the RNase domain of HepT in Shewanella oneidensis. Furthermore, in vitro enzymatic assays showed that the three AMPs are transferred to HepT by MntA consecutively with ATP serving as the substrate, and this polyadenylylation is crucial for reducing HepT toxicity. Additionally, the GSX10DXD motif, which is conserved among MntA proteins, is the key active motif for polyadenylylating and neutralizing HepT. Thus, HepT/MntA represents a new type of TA system, and the polyadenylylation-dependent TA neutralization mechanism is prevalent in bacteria and archaea.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Bacterial Toxins", "Shewanella", "Toxin-Antitoxin Systems"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianyun", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiangkai", "Last Name": "Zhen", "Affiliation": "Provincial University Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation, The Key Laboratory of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Biomedical Research Center of South China, Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Kaihao", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianlang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaolong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Provincial University Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation, The Key Laboratory of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Biomedical Research Center of South China, Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunxue", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Thomas K", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802-4400, USA."}, {"First Name": "Songying", "Last Name": "Ouyang", "Affiliation": "Provincial University Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation, The Key Laboratory of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Biomedical Research Center of South China, Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China."}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2020Nov04"}, {"PMID": "33037069", "Title": "Temporal and spatial effect of air pollution on hospital admissions for myocardial infarction: a case-crossover study.", "Abstract": "In studies showing associations between ambient air pollution and myocardial infarction (MI), data have been lacking on the inherent spatial variability of air pollution.

Its antiviral activity has recently attracted much attention because selenium improves the antiviral capacity of animal cells against a few viruses relevant to human diseases. In this study, the red elemental selenium was purified from the fermentative culture of Herbaspirillum camelliae WT00C and then used to culture epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells or feed crucian carp and zebrafish. Finally, its antiviral effects were investigated at the cell level and living fishes after spring viraemia of carp virus infection. At the cell level, 5, 10 and 20\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml-1 red elemental selenium significantly induced the expression of interferon (IFN) and ISG15 genes in EPC cells. The viral TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) values in the EPC cells incubated with 5, 10 and 20\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml-1 red elemental selenium were significantly less than those of the control. More expression of IFN and ISG15 genes and less TCID50 values indicate that red elemental selenium indeed improves the antiviral capability of EPC cells. In the crucian carp fed with the food containing 5 and 10 \u03bcg\u2009g-1 red elemental selenium, IFN expressions showed 13- and 39-fold increases at the 16th day of post-injection, and its expression was dependent on selenium concentrations. Meanwhile, no fish death occurred in all the experimental groups. In the zebrafish fed with the red worm containing 5\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g-1 red elemental selenium, IFN and Mx expressions and survival rate were significantly higher than those of the control. The results of this study show that red elemental selenium indeed improves the antiviral activity of fish. The antiviral effects of selenium mainly come from its immune regulation through its incorporation into selenoproteins. The optimum level of selenium contributes to improving fish immunity, whereas excess selenium causes excessive immune and inflammatory responses.", "Keywords": ["antiviral activity, crucian carp, red

Here, by analyzing RNA-sequencing databases and comparing the transcript and protein levels of fibrillar collagen in WT and global-knockout mice, we found that slit guidance ligand 3 (SLIT3) was present predominantly in fibrillar collagen-producing cells and that SLIT3 deficiency attenuated collagen production in the heart and other nonneuronal tissues. We then performed transverse aortic constriction or pulmonary artery banding to induce left and right ventricular pressure overload, respectively, in WT and knockout mice. We discovered that SLIT3 deficiency abrogated fibrotic and hypertrophic changes and promoted long-term ventricular function and overall survival in both left and right ventricular pressure overload. Furthermore, we found that SLIT3 stimulated fibroblast activity and fibrillar collagen production, which coincided with the transcription and nuclear localization of the mechanotransducer yes-associated protein 1.

In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes of fruit size and shape from the aspects of morphology, cellular levels and endogenous hormones for nine typical cucumber inbred lines. The results show that fruit length had a strong positive correlation to the cell number in the longitudinal section of fruit throughout the four stages of 0, 6, 12, and 30 DAA (days after anthesis).

The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content showed significant positive correlations to the fruit length at all fruit growth stages of -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 DAA, but IAA content and fruit diameter showed significant negative correlations for all the stages except for at -6 DAA.

The hardness of diamond can be increased through nanostructuring strategies1,2, among which the formation of high-density nanoscale twins - crystalline regions related by symmetry - also toughens diamond2. In materials other than diamond, there are several other promising approaches to enhancing toughness in addition to nanotwinning3, such as bio-inspired laminated composite toughening4-7, transformation toughening8 and dual-phase toughening9, but there has been little research into such approaches in diamond. Here we report the structural characterization of a diamond composite hierarchically assembled with coherently interfaced diamond polytypes (different stacking sequences), interwoven nanotwins and interlocked nanograins. The architecture of the composite enhances toughness more than nanotwinning alone, without sacrificing hardness. Single-edge notched beam tests yield a toughness up to five times that of synthetic diamond10, even greater than that of magnesium alloys. When fracture occurs, a crack propagates through diamond nanotwins of the 3C (cubic) polytype along {111} planes, via a zigzag path. As the crack encounters regions of non-3C polytypes, its propagation is diffused into sinuous fractures, with local transformation into 3C diamond near the fracture surfaces. Both processes dissipate strain energy, thereby enhancing toughness. This work could prove useful in making superhard materials and engineering ceramics. By using structural architecture with synergetic effects of hardening and toughening, the trade-off between hardness and toughness may eventually be surmounted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [],

underlying mechanisms. Transgenic mice overexpressing calpastatin, the endogenous calpain inhibitor, were introduced in the present study. The murine model of viral myocarditis (VMC) was established by intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 into transgenic and wild-type mice. Myocardial injury was measured by H&E staining and ELISA for cTnI. CVB3 replication was assessed via capsid protein VP1 detection and virus titration. The fibrotic factors collagen and TGF-\u03b21 were evaluated by Masson staining and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. Moreover, the levels of NLRP3, AIM2, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, cleaved caspase-11 and the pyroptosis indicators GSDMD p30, IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1 were determined by real-time PCR, western blot or immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, peripheral IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1 were evaluated by ELISA. We observed that CVB3-infected transgenic mice had lower pathological scores, peripheral cTnI levels, viral loads and expression levels of collagen and TGF-\u03b21 in the heart than CVB3-infected wild-type mice. Furthermore, we found decreased levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1 and cleaved caspase-11 in the hearts of CVB3-infected transgenic mice.

Additionally, calpastatin overexpression significantly reduced the levels of GSDMD p30, IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1 in the myocardium as well as peripheral IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1.

In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge on the role and involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis and treatment of CVDs. NLRP3 inflammasome functions as a molecular platform, and triggers the activation of caspase-1 and cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2, pro-IL-18, and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cleaved NT-GSDMD forms pores in the cell membrane and initiates pyroptosis, inducing cell death and release of many intracellular pro-inflammatory molecules. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is triggered via inter-related pathways downstream of K+ efflux, lysosomal disruption, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, the Golgi apparatus and noncoding RNAs are gradually being recognized to play important roles in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Many investigations have revealed the association between NLRP3 inflammasome and CVDs, including atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and heart failure induced by pressure overload or cardiomyopathy. Some existing medications, including orthodox and natural medicines, used for CVD treatment have been newly discovered to act via NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome pathway components such as NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 may be considered as novel therapeutic targets for CVDs.

The genomes of Pf prophages contain not only core genes encoding functions involved in phage replication, structure and assembly but also accessory genes. By studying the accessory genes in the Pf4 prophage in P. aeruginosa PAO1, we provided experimental evidence to demonstrate that PA0729 and the upstream ORF Rorf0727 near the right attachment site of Pf4 form a type II toxin/antitoxin (TA) pair. Importantly, we found that the deletion of the toxin gene PA0729 greatly increased Pf4 phage production. We thus suggest the toxin PA0729 be named PfiT for Pf4 inhibition toxin and Rorf0727 be named PfiA for PfiT antitoxin. The PfiT toxin directly binds to PfiA and functions as a corepressor of PfiA for the TA operon. The PfiAT complex exhibited autoregulation by binding to a palindrome (5'-AATTCN5 GTTAA-3') overlapping the -35 region of the TA operon. The deletion of pfiT disrupted TA autoregulation and activated pfiA expression. Additionally, the deletion of pfiT also activated the expression of the replication initiation factor gene PA0727. Moreover, the Pf4 phage released from the pfiT deletion mutant overcame the immunity provided by the phage repressor Pf4r.

Here we demonstrate that the intratracheal instillation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), a standard fine particle, exacerbate doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice through altering gut microbiota and pulmonary and colonic macrophage phenotype. MWCNTs (25 \u03bcg/kg per day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks) promoted cardiotoxicity and apoptosis in the DOX (2 mg/kg, twice a week for 5 weeks)-treated C57BL/6 mice. MWCNTs exaggerated DOX-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis characterized by the increased abundances of Helicobacteraceae and Coriobacteriaceae. In addition, MWCNTs promoted DOX-induced M1-like polarization of colonic macrophages with an increase in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and CC chemokine ligand 2 in peripheral blood. Importantly, treatment with the antibiotics attenuated MWCNTs plus DOX-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and M1-like polarization of colonic macrophages. The fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrated that MWCNTs exaggerated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity with M1-like polarization of colonic macrophages. The conditioned medium from MWCNTs-treated pulmonary macrophages promoted DOX-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and colonic macrophage polarization. Furthermore, the co-culture of macrophages and fecal bacteria promoted M1-like macrophage polarization and their production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and thereby exacerbated the effects of MWCNTs. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 blockade, either alone or in combination attenuated MWCNTs-exacerbated cardiotoxicity. In summary, MWCNTs exacerbate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in mice through gut microbiota and pulmonary and colonic macrophage interaction.

However, lithium loss in the formation cycle at the anode side reduces the energy density of state-of-the-art LIBs with carbon anode materials. This situation will be even more severe for future LIBs using high-capacity Si-based anode materials. In this study, a transition metal-based nanocomposite with built-in lithium source was synthesized, featuring Fe nanodomains with a size of \u223c5 nm uniformly dispersed in a hybrid Li2O and LiF matrix with intimate contact between them. The Fe/LiF/Li2O nanocomposite released a high Li-ion capacity of 550 mA h/g based on a multielectron inverse conversion reaction during the first-cycle charge process and exhibited better ambient stability than the counterpart with a pure Li2O matrix and also a lower lithium-extraction voltage and faster reaction kinetics than the counterpart with a pure LiF matrix. Serving as an additive to various cathodes (e.g., LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2), the Fe/LiF/Li2O nanocomposite showed excellent lithium compensation effect. Using 4.8 wt % Fe/LiF/Li2O additive based on the total mass of the electrodes, a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|SiO-graphite full cell with a high cathode mass loading of 20 mg/cm2 exhibited a high reversible capacity of 2.9 mA h/cm2 at 0.5 C after 100 cycles which is a 15% increase in comparison to the counterpart without the prelithiation additive. After the Fe/LiF/Li2O nanocomposite was immersed into the electrolyte and rested for 72 h, the content of iron metal in the electrolyte was negligible, indicating that this prelithiation additive was stable in the electrolyte and would not cause any side reactions, such as the shuttle of iron ions during cycling. The high \"donor\" Li-ion capacity, good ambient stability, and its compatibility with existing cathode materials and battery fabrication processes make the Fe/LiF/Li2O nanocomposite a promising cathode prelithiation additive to offset the initial lithium loss and improve the energy density of LIBs.", "Keywords": ["Fe/LiF/Li2O nanocomposite", "cathode prelithiation", "initial lithium loss", "lithium-ion batteries", "stability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junmou", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China."}, {"First Name": "Wenyu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China."}, {"First Name": "Alex Yong", "Last Name": "Sheng Eng", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering , Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) , 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis , Singapore 138634 , Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China."}, {"First Name": "Mintao", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi Wei", "Last Name": "Seh", "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering , Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) , 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis , Singapore 138634 , Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Yongming", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China."}], "Journal": "Nano letters", "PubDate": "2020Jan08"}, {"PMID": "31753902", "Title": "Existing comorbidities in people with osteoarthritis: a retrospective analysis of a population-based cohort in Alberta, Canada.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of comorbidities among people with osteoarthritis (OA) using administrative health data.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "administrative health data", "comorbidity", "depression", "hypertension", "osteoarthritis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alberta", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Comorbidity", "Databases, Factual", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoarthritis", "Prevalence", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Retrospective Studies", "Sex Distribution", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Marshall", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada damarsha@ucalgary.ca."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl", "Last Name": "Barnabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Yee", "Affiliation": "Research Facilitation, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Faris", "Affiliation": "Research Facilitation, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Claire", "Last Name": "Barber", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Dianne", "Last Name": "Mosher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Noseworthy", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Werle", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Lix", "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."}], "Journal": "BMJ open", "PubDate": "2019Nov21"}, {"PMID": "31747350", "Title": "Aqueous Extracts of Se-Enriched Auricularia auricular Exhibits Antioxidant Capacity and Attenuate Liver Damage in High-Fat Diet/Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice.", "Abstract": "Oxidative stress triggered by hyperglycemia is thought to be a major factor in the development of liver disease during diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant capacity of aqueous extracts of selenium-enriched Auricularia auricular (AESA) and further investigate the hepatic protection and potential mechanism of AESA in a mouse model of diabetes. An in vitro antioxidant assay confirmed that AESA exhibited better antioxidant capacity characterized by increased reducing power and scavenging capacity of free radicals, such as diphenyl picrylhydrazyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide radical. The diabetic model was induced by high-fat diet combined with a single injection of streptozotocin in C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that AESA treatment improved diabetes-induced disorders of lipid metabolisms and alleviated liver damage in diabetic mice. Furthermore, the antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase in liver were increased and malondialdehyde level was decreased with AESA treatment compared with those in the DM group. In parallel, AESA significantly reduced the contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in liver in comparison with the DM group. In addition, western blot results showed that the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and phospho-p38 kinase were remarkably decreased in AESA treatment group compared with DM group.

The present study delineates the structural and functional characterization of NK-lysin from yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidrac) (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco). PfNK-lysin encodes a 153-residue peptide, which displays the hallmark features of other known NK-lysins with the ordered array of six well-conserved cysteine residues and five-exon/four-intron structure. It was found to be ubiquitous in tissues, being detected most abundantly in gill and head kidney. In vivo exposure to stimuli (LPS, PolyI:C, and Edwardsiella ictaluri) induced PfNK-lysin expression in head kidney and spleen. Synthetic PfNK-lysin-derived peptide exhibited in vitro bactericidal potency against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the highest inhibitory effect on pathogen Edwardsiella ictaluri. Fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy further confirmed its capacity to cause damage to the bacterial plasma membrane.

Chromosome 22q deletions are well-recognized frequent abnormalities in GISTs, occurring in \u223c50% of GISTs. These deletions are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease via currently unidentified tumor suppressor mechanisms. Using whole exome sequencing, we report recurrent genomic inactivated DEPDC5 gene mutations in GISTs (16.4%, 9 of 55 patients). The demonstration of clonal DEPDC5 inactivation mutations in longitudinal specimens and in multiple metastases from individual patients suggests that these mutations have tumorigenic roles in GIST progression. DEPDC5 inactivation promotes GIST tumor growth in vitro and in nude mice. DEPDC5 reduces cell proliferation through the mTORC1-signaling pathway and subsequently induces cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, DEPDC5 modulates the sensitivity of GIST to KIT inhibitors, and the combination therapy with mTOR inhibitor and KIT inhibitor may work better in GIST patients with DEPDC5 inactivation. These findings of recurrent genomic alterations, together with functional data, validate the DEPDC5 as a bona fide tumor suppressor contributing to GIST progression and a biologically relevant target

cardiotoxicity. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) such as microRNA-140-5p and miR-23a aggravate Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of miRNA let-7f-2-3p by long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 inhibits exportin-1 (XPO1)-mediated nuclear export of hematopoietic-substrate-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Treatment of the H9c2 cells with the Dox (1\u00a0\u03bcM) for 6\u00a0h inhibited HAX-1 nuclear export and decreased XPO1 expression. Overexpression of XPO1 significantly attenuated the Dox-induced leakage of myocardial enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis with the increased HAX-1 nuclear export. Differentially expressed miRNAs including let-7f-2-3p were selected from the Dox or vehicle-treated cardiomyocytes. TargetScan and luciferase assay showed that let-7f-2-3p targeted XPO1 3' UTR. Inhibition of let-7f-2-3p reduced Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibiting XPO1-mediated HAX-1 nuclear export, whereas let-7f-2-3p overexpression aggravated these effects. In addition, lncRNA NEAT1 was identified as an endogenous sponge RNA to repress let-7f-2-3p expression. Overexpression of lncRNA NEAT1 abolished the increased let-7f-2-3p expression by Dox, and thereby attenuated cardiotoxicity. The loss function of let-7f-2-3p increased XPO1-mediated HAX-1 nuclear export and reduced myocardial injury in Dox (20\u00a0mg/kg)-treated rats. Importantly, let-7f-2-3p inhibition in mice alleviated Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and preserved the antitumor efficacy. Together, let-7f-2-3p regulated by lncRNA NEAT1 aggravates Dox-induced cardiotoxicity through inhibiting XPO1-mediated HAX-1 nuclear export, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.", "Keywords": ["Cardiotoxicity", "Doxorubicin", "HAX-1", "Let-7f-2-3p", "LncRNA NEAT1", "XPO1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Apoptosis", "Carcinoma, Lewis Lung", "Cardiotoxicity", "Cell Line", "Doxorubicin", "Heart", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Karyopherins", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "MicroRNAs", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Up-Regulation", "Exportin 1 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanzhuo", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenfan", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuewei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Yue", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China. xiaoyangzh@whu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Archives of toxicology", "PubDate": "2019Nov"}, {"PMID": "31568784", "Title": "Cardioprotective effects of galectin-3 inhibition against ischemia/reperfusion injury.", "Abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is caused by the restoration of the coronary blood flow following an ischemic episode.

However, the specific function of HSP90 paralogs, as well as the underlying molecular cascades remains largely unknown. This study aims to unravel the paralog-specific role of HSP90 in lipid metabolism and try to discover paralog-specific HSP90 inhibitors. Methods: In non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, as well as in diet induced obese (DIO) mice, expression of HSP90 paralogs were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot. In hepatocytes and in DIO mice, HSP90 proteins were knockdown by siRNAs/shRNAs, metabolic parameters, as well as downstream signaling were then investigated. By virtue screening, corylin was found to bind specifically to HSP90\u03b2. Using photo-affinity labeling and mass spectrum, corylin binding proteins were identified. After oral administration of corylin, its lipid lowering effects in different metabolic disease mice models were evaluated. Results: We showed that hepatic HSP90\u03b2, rather than HSP90\u03b1, was overexpressed in NAFLD patients and obese mice. Hepatic HSP90\u03b2 was also clinical relevant to serum lipid level. Depletion of HSP90\u03b2 promoted mature sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (mSREBPs) degradation through Akt-GSK3\u03b2-FBW7 pathway, thereby dramatically decreased the content of neutral lipids and cholesterol. We discovered an HSP90\u03b2-selective inhibitor (corylin) that only bound to its middle domain. We found that corylin treatment partially suppressed Akt activity only at Thr308 site and specifically promoted mSREBPs ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Corylin treatment significantly reduced lipid content in both liver cell lines and human primary hepatocytes. In animal studies, we showed that corylin ameliorated obesity-induced fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Principle conclusions: HSP90\u03b2 plays a parolog-specific role in regulating lipid homeostasis.

In the process of haze pollution governance, environmental regulation not only has a direct impact on haze pollution but may also affects haze pollution indirectly through four transmission channels, which are coal consumption, foreign direct investment (FDI), industrial structure and technological innovation. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how environmental regulation affects haze pollution governance through both direct and indirect impacts. Based on the difference Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), this paper explores the direct and indirect impact of environmental regulation on haze pollution governance over the period 2006-2016. The results show that China's current environmental regulation had effectively inhibited the haze pollution and achieved the expected effects. For coal consumption, it significantly aggravated haze pollution, but the ER implemented or not. However, environmental regulation provided a force mechanism to promote transformation and upgrading of industrial structure, thus to reverse the impact direction of industrial structure on haze pollution and mitigated the haze pollution. Moreover, the results indicate that FDI in China turned out to have a \"pollution halo\" effect and reduced the degree of haze pollution, while technological innovation had the \"compliance cost\" effect and increased the degree of haze pollution. Additionally, we find that automobile exhaust emissions and economic development were also important reasons for the increase of haze.

We found that ~0.1% of host cells are lysed to release P2 constitutively during host growth. P2 phage production is induced by a prophage-encoded Rep protein and its excision is induced by the Cox protein. We also found that P2 genome excision leads to the disruption of wobble base pairing of SsrA due to site-specific recombination, thus disrupting the trans-translation function of SsrA. We further demonstrated that P2 excision greatly hinders growth in seawater medium and inhibits biofilm formation. Complementation with a functional SsrA in the P2-excised strain completely restores the growth defects in seawater medium and partially restores biofilm formation.

To systematically profile morpho-electric properties of mammalian neurons, we established a single-cell characterization pipeline using standardized patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions. We built a publicly accessible online database, the Allen Cell Types Database, to display these datasets. Intrinsic physiological properties were measured from 1,938 neurons from the adult laboratory mouse visual cortex, morphological properties were measured from 461 reconstructed neurons, and 452 neurons had both measurements available. Quantitative features were used to classify neurons into distinct types using unsupervised methods. We established a taxonomy of morphologically and electrophysiologically defined cell types for this region of the cortex, with 17 electrophysiological types, 38 morphological types and 46 morpho-electric types. There was good correspondence with previously defined transcriptomic cell types and subclasses using the same transgenic mouse lines.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals",

In this study, we assessed the role of p53 in MDS and AML cells treated with decitabine using mouse models for MLL-AF9-driven AML and mutant ASXL1-driven MDS/AML. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of p53 in MDS/AML cells did not increase, but rather decreased their sensitivity to decitabine. Forced expression of a dominant-negative p53 fragment (p53DD) in these cells also decreased their responses to decitabine, confirming that acute inhibition of p53 conferred resistance to decitabine in AML and MDS/AML cells. In contrast, MLL-AF9-expressing AML cells generated from bone marrow progenitors of Trp53-deficient mice were more sensitive to decitabine in vivo than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that long-term chronic p53 deficiency increases decitabine sensitivity in AML cells.

Cells were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped. Strain ZY74T produced round, yellow-pigmented, smooth and opaque colonies. Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain ZY74T was found to be affiliated with members of the genus Chitinophaga. Its closest members were Chitinophagabarathri YLT18T (97.72\u200a%) and Chitinophaganiabensis JS13-10T (97.17\u200a%). The genome size of strain ZY74T was 6.61\u2009Mb, containing 5351 predicted protein-coding genes, with a DNA G+C\u2009content of 55.0\u2009mol%. The average nucleotide identity values of strain ZY74T with C. barathri YLT18T and C. niabensis DSM 24787T were 76.12 and 73.32\u200a%, respectively. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain ZY74T with C. barathri YLT18T and C. niabensis JS13-10T were 20.60 and 19.40\u200a%, respectively.

Activating KRAS mutation, occurring in >90% PDACs, is present in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, the precursor ductal lesions of PDAC, indicating additional genetic alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of PDAC. PDAC sequencing projects identify recurrent genomic ERBB2 alterations, mutations and amplifications, in 8.5% of PDAC patients, ranking as the top hit among the 100 receptor tyrosine kinases-encoding genes. Introduction of the ERBB2 mutations encoding protein variants S310F, S423R, R678Q, Q679L, E717D, L755S, V777L and V842I into human pancreatic epithelial cells causes oncogenic transformation, increasing ERBB2 signaling, anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor xenograft growth in nude mice, demonstrating that they are activating mutations. Interestingly, in many PDACs, mutations in ERBB2 and KRAS occur together. ERBB2 activating mutants facilitate KRAS-driven oncogenic properties. Introduction of ERBB2 mutations into KRAS-mutant PDAC cells activates ERBB2 signaling, promotes tumor growth and attenuates KRAS dependency. In contrast, a CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of ERBB2 in ERBB2-amplified PDAC cells inhibits ERBB2 signaling, colony formation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor xenograft formation. Finally, oncogenic ERBB2 aberrations can be abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors. ERBB2 and KRAS inhibition cooperate to suppress PDAC cell growth in vitro and to promote tumor regression in nude mice, providing a rationale for testing an anti-ERBB2 drug in combination with a KRAS

Selenium (Se), an essential trace element, exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory abilities. Here, our study aimed to investigate the protective effects of aqueous extracts of Se-enriched Auricularia auricular (AESAA) on aging mice induced by d-galactose (D-gal) and explore its potential mechanism. d-gal was administered (100\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously for 12 weeks to establish an aging mouse model. Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted to assess the cognitive deficits of mice. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in hippocampus were measured to evaluate oxidative stress. The contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in hippocampus were determined by ELISA method. Further, hippocampal levels of RAGE, p-Erk, p-JNK, p-P38 and p-NF-\u03baB were detected by western blot and the RAGE expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. We found that AESAA supplementation significantly decreased d-gal-induced cognitive deficits, as evidenced by better performance in the MWM test. Furthermore, AESAA treatment attenuated oxidative stress and decreased the contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus. Importantly, AESAA inhibited the up-regulation of RAGE, p-Erk, p-JNK, p-P38 in the hippocampus of d-gal treated mice. Moreover, the results also indicated that AESAA inhibited p-NF-\u03baB and p-I\u03baB\u03b1 expression.

However, the specific anti-tumor activity of XAG in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the relevant mechanisms are not known. Herein, we evaluated the effect of XAG against HCC in vitro and in vivo. Although XAG treatment did not significantly reduce the viability of the Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines, it suppressed cell migration, invasion, and EMT. This anti-metastatic effect of XAG was due to induction of autophagy, because treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyadenine (3-MA) or knockdown of the pro-autophagy Beclin-1 effectively abrogated the XAG-induced suppression of metastasis. Mechanistically, XAG induced autophagy via activation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, and XAG treatment dramatically increased the expression of p-AMPK while decreasing p-mTOR expression. In addition, blocking AMPK/mTOR axis with compound C abrogated the autophagy-mediated inhibition of metastasis. The murine model of HCC metastasis also showed that XAG effectively reduced the number of metastatic pulmonary nodules. Taken together, our results revealed that autophagy via the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway is essential for the anti-metastatic effect of XAG against HCC. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the anti-tumor activity of XAG but also provide a basis for its clinical application in HCC. Before this study, evidence of XAG on HCC was purely anecdotal; present study provides the first comprehensive assessments of XAG on HCC metastasis and investigates its underlying mechanism. Results suggest that XAG exerts anti-metastatic properties against HCC through inducing autophagy which is mediated by the activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

potential clinical benefits in cancer treatment. Recently, the immunologic therapies application in cancer therapy also showed a continuously increase. CCL19 has shown its great potential as a candidate immunomodulator for colon cancer therapy by increasing the possibility of interaction among dendritic cells, T and B cells in secondary lymphatic tissue, thus regulating the primary (or secondary) adaptive immune responses. In this work, a folic acid modified targeted gene-delivery system consisting of DOTAP, MPEG-PLA, and Fa-PEG-PLA (F-DMA) was developed successfully through a self-assembly approach. We proved that CCL19 expression was much higher in cancer cells after transfection with F-DMA/CCL19 than after transfection with DMA/CCL19. The supernatant from cancer cells transfected with both F-DMA/CCL19 and DMA/CCL19 stimulated the activation and cytotoxicity of T lymphocytes, the maturation of DCs, and the polarization of macrophages in vitro. Moreover, the administration of F-DMA/CCL19 complex to treat tumor-bearing mice has shown significant cancer growth repression in both subcutaneous and peritoneal models. The underling antitumor mechanism is established through repressing neovascularization, promoting apoptosis, as well as reducing proliferation by activating the immune system.

We hypothesized that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway also can regulate HPV vascular function via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, signaling through the functional transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels. In this study, male BALB/c mice were exposed to normoxic or 10% oxygen (hypoxic) conditions for six weeks, after which systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed. Transient intracellular calcium was monitored using a fluorescence imaging system. Muscle tension was measured with a contractile force recording system, and protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting. We found that the expressions of RhoA and ROCK were increased in mouse pulmonary arteries (PAs) under conditions of chronic hypoxia. Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway prevented the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH), as evidenced by significantly reduced PA remodeling and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Immunoblotting results revealed that inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway significantly decreased the expression of HIF-1\u03b1. Knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 down-regulated the expression and function of the TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels in PASMCs under conditions of hypoxia. Contraction of the PAs and a Ca2+ influx into PASMCs through either receptor- or store-operated Ca2+ channels were also increased after hypoxia. However, RhoA/ROCK inhibitors markedly attenuated these changes.

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrate that glycyrrhizic acid (GA) prevents HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis through gut microbiota. GA reduced HFD-enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment, pro-metastatic protein S100A8/A9 expression and metastasis burden of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma, accompanied by gut microbiota alteration and colonic macrophage polarization far away the M1-like phenotype. These parameters were greatly decreased by treatment with antibiotics, recolonization of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Clostridium sordellii, and administration of lipopolysaccharide or deoxycholic acid. Macrophage depletion attenuated HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, but failed to further affect the effects of GA. Mechanistically, counteraction of HFD-enhanced gut microbiota dysbiosis by GA inhibited Gr-1+ myeloid cell migration and S100A8/A9 expression through decreasing the proportion of M1-like macrophages and their production of CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the colons via LPS/HMGB1/NF-\u03baB signaling inactivation.

However, the structural changes in microcirculation during acupoint sensitization have yet to be elucidated because the high-resolution microcirculation imaging of acupoints has been difficult to obtain. In this study, the structural changes in microcirculation at the Zusanli (ST36), Yanglingquan (GB34) and nonacupoint sites on days 0, 7 and 21 were dynamically observed during acupoint sensitization in an experimental knee osteoarthritis mouse model by using optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy.

Here, we investigated whether carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) prevent tumor metastasis through regulating macrophage polarization. In Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice, intratracheal instillation of MWCNTs-COOH significantly reduced metastatic burden in the lungs. MWCNTs-COOH promoted the expression of M1 markers (iNOS and CXCR10) and inhibited the expression of M2 markers (CD206 and Arg-1) along with an increased expression of Th1 cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12) and decreased expression of Th2 cytokines (TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10). Such changes were accompanied with TLR4 mRNA and protein elevation. Importantly, macrophage depletion in mice lungs reversed the anti-metastatic effects of MWCNTs-COOH. In vitro, MWCNTs-COOH switched IL-4/13-treated macrophages to the M1 phenotype and thus prevented the migration and invasion of LLC cells, accompanied by the upregulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4/NF-\u03baB p65 signaling. Moreover, TAK-242 (resatorvid), a specific TLR4 inhibitor, reversed the effects of MWCNTs-COOH on macrophage polarization. In summary, MWCNTs-COOH effectively prevent tumor metastasis through skewing M2-polarized macrophages to M1 via activating TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling.

Feature selection (FS) is an essential process for building accurate and interpretable prediction models, but to our best knowledge no study has investigated the robustness and applicability of such selection process for AKI. In this study, we compared eight widely-applied FS methods for AKI prediction using nine-years of electronic medical records (EMR) and examined heterogeneity in feature rankings produced by the methods. FS methods were compared in terms of stability with respect to data sampling variation, similarity between selection results, and AKI prediction performance. Prediction accuracy did not intrinsically guarantee the feature ranking stability. Across different FS methods, the prediction performance did not change significantly, while the importance rankings of features were quite different. A positive correlation was observed between the complexity of suitable FS method and sample size.

For the first time, a subgenotype C2 of EV71 named SY30-2 was isolated from a HFMD case in Beijing, China. Since it is uncertain whether antibodies raised against subgenotype C4 of EV71 can protect C2 EV71, it is important to monitor and check the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against new EV71 subgenotypes. To find out the causes for the different NtAb, this study is to investigate the relationships between amino acid residue variations and cross-reactive antibodies against EV71 subgenotypes C2 and C4. Methods: Nucleotide and amino acid sequences from full-length genome sequence of SY30-2 were compared to EV71 reference strains. A microneutralization test was used to detect neutralizing antibody (NTAb) in the sera of subgenotype C4 of EV71 infected cases against SY30-2 and FY17 (a C4 isolate). The 3D structure of the viral capsid protein of SY30-2 was constructed. Results: Genome sequence and similarity plot analyses showed that SY30-2 shared the highest identity with subgenotype C2 of EV71 strains in every fragment of the genome. While the microneutralization test result showed that children infected with subgenotype C4 of EV71 had higher NTAb titers against FY17 than SY30-2 (p < 0.001). The amino acid sequence comparison revealed that four amino acid residues VP1-22, VP1-31, VP1-249 and VP3-93 were highly conserved in subgenotype C4 of EV71 compared with the corresponding amino acid residues on subgenotype C2 of EV71 (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the 3D-structure of viral capsid protein showed that VP1-22, VP1-31 and VP3-93 were located on the surface of virion. Conclusion: This is the first report of an EV71 subgenotype C2 isolated from HFMD in Beijing, China. Only a few antigenic variations on subgenotype C2 of EV71 could have led to a great decrease in NTAb titer. Thus, imported new genotypes and subgenotypes of EV71 should be closely monitored.

Compared with COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, Sal (80\u00a0mg/kg) presented a superior anti-arthritic profile in MSU crystal-treated rats, accompanied with the decreased expression of COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), leukotriene B4 (LTB4 ), and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) in the synovial fluid macrophages. Sal decreased representative M1 marker (iNOS and CD86, etc.) expression and M1 cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) production, whereas it increased M2 marker (CD206 and Arg-1) expression and M2 cytokine (TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10) production. The injection of conditioned medium from MSU crystal-treated macrophages into the ankle joint of rats reproduced the gouty inflammation, which was attenuated by Sal. Mechanistically, down-regulation of COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A in the RAW264.7 and NR8383 macrophages by Sal skewed macrophage polarization away from the M1 phenotype, and thereby prevented neutrophil migration and chondrocyte degradation with STAT1 and NF-\u03baB inactivation. Conversely, overexpression of COX-2, 5-LOX, CYP4A or STAT1, or exogenous addition of IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 partially abolished these effects. Together, inhibition of COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A in macrophages by Sal ameliorates MSU crystal-induced inflammation through decreasing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production, and may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy.", "Keywords": ["arachidonic acid", "gouty inflammation", "macrophage", "metabolism", "salidroside"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase", "Arachidonic Acid", "Arthritis, Gouty", "Cell Movement", "Cell Polarity", "Chondrocytes", "Crystallization", "Cyclooxygenase 2", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP4A", "Disease Models, Animal", "Down-Regulation", "Glucosides", "Interleukin-1beta", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "NF-kappa B", "Neutrophils", "Phenols", "Phenotype", "RAW 264.7 Cells", "Rabbits", "Rats, Wistar", "STAT1 Transcription Factor", "Signal Transduction", "Synovial Fluid", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Uric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanzhuo", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Honglin", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Honglei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Animal Experimental Center of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Miao", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of leukocyte biology", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "30214589", "Title": "miRNA-199a-5p suppresses proliferation and invasion by directly targeting NF-\u03baB1 in human ovarian cancer cells.", "Abstract": "The aberrant expression of microRNA (miRNA)-199a-5p has been frequently reported in a number of cancer types, but to the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported in ovarian cancer (OC).

Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of miR-199a-5p overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of OC cells. The level of miR-199a-5p in OC cell lines was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The miR-199a-5p mimic was transiently transfected into OC cells using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the BrdU-ELISA results indicated that the exogenous expression of miR-199a-5p inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, miR-199a-5p overexpression was able to inhibit the invasion of HO-8910 and ES-2 cells. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 in OC cells. NF-\u03baB1 expression was reduced by upregulation of miR-199a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that NF-\u03baB1 was a potential target of miR-199a-5p. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-199a-5p was able to directly target the 3'UTR of NF-\u03baB1.

Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal control group (N), sham osteoarthritis group (S), light osteoarthritis group (A), mild osteoarthritis group (B), and heavy osteoarthritis group (C). The obtained results showed that the blood perfusion levels at the acupoints Yanglingquan (GB34), Zusanli (ST36), and Heding (EX-LE2) in groups A, B, and C were higher than those in groups N and S on days 14, 21, and 28 (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05).

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious pathogen of cats and a surrogate for Norwalk virus. Interferon efficiently inhibits the replication of FCV, but the mechanism of the antiviral activity is poorly understood.

The results showed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) can significantly inhibit the replication of FCV, whereas the other ISGs tested in this study failed. Further, we found that IRF1 was localized in the nucleus and efficiently activated IFN-\u03b2 and the ISRE promoter. IRF1 can trigger the production of endogenous interferon and the expression of ISGs, suggesting that IRF1 can positively regulate IFN signalling. Importantly, the mRNA and protein levels of IRF1 were reduced upon FCV infection, which may be a new strategy for FCV to evade the innate immune system.

OsCTZFP8 encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein, which contains a typical zinc finger motif, as well as a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine-rich region (L-box). Expression of OsCTZFP8 was differentially induced by several abiotic stresses and was strongly induced by cold stress. Subcellular localization assay and yeast one-hybrid analysis revealed that OsCTZFP8 was a nuclear protein and has transactivation activity. To characterize the function of OsCTZFP8 in rice, the full-length cDNA of OsCTZFP8 was isolated and transgenic rice with overexpression of OsCTZFP8 driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter was generated using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Among 46 independent transgenic lines, 6 single-copy homozygous overexpressing lines were selected by Southern blot analysis and Basta resistance segregation assay in both T1 and T2 generations. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsCTZFP8 exhibited cold tolerant phenotypes with significantly higher pollen fertilities and seed setting rates than nontransgenic control plants. In addition, yield per plant of OsCTZFP8-expressing lines was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that of nontransgenic control plants under cold treatments.

However, the underlining mechanism remains elusive. Here, we examined whether SF blocks microglia switching to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effects in cuprizone-induced demyelination. The microglia reprogramming effects of SF in the mice model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was measured by histological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological methods. We also measured the effects of the condition media from SF-treated microglia on the differentiation of OLN-93 cells. Insights of the mechanism of ceRNAs of miR-136-5p and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR were gained from bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assays and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation. Microglia switched to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in cuprizone induced-demyelination. Conversely, SF inhibited the M1-like polarization with the increased remyelination which was attenuated by microglia depletion. SF inhibited production of M1-like factors TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3 in microglia, and thereby promoted the differentiation of OLN-93 oligodendrocytes. SF down-regulated lncRNA HOTAIR but up-regulated miR-136-5p, and thus inactivated AKT2-NF-\u03baB in cuprizone-treated microglia. Importantly, lncRNA HOTAIR overexpression reversed the increased miR-136-5p expression by SF and thereby attenuated the inhibition of AKT2-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.

Here, we investigated whether inhibition of COX-2/mPGES-1 and 5-LOX in macrophages by leonurine ameliorates monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced inflammation. Virtual screening assay and in vitro enzyme inhibition assay showed that leonurine was a potential inhibitor of COX-2, mPGES-1 and 5-LOX. Compared with COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, leonurine (30\u202fmg/kg) significantly decreased ankle perimeter, gait score and neutrophil number in synovial fluid in MSU crystal-treated rats, accompanied with the decreased expression of COX-2, mPGES-1 and 5-LOX and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in the synovial fluid macrophages. In addition, leonurine decreased representative M1 marker (iNOS and CD86) expression, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and M1 cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) production. In the in vitro cultured RAW264.7 and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), blockade of COX-2/mPGES-1 and 5-LOX by leonurine inhibited macrophage M1 polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to MSU crystals, and thus down-regulated IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 with STAT1 and NF-\u03baB inactivation. Conversely, these effects were partially abolished by overexpression of COX-2, mPGES-1, 5-LOX or STAT1. Furthermore, leonurine prevented a positive feedback loop between COX-2/mPGES-1/5-LOX and IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1 in MSU crystal-induced inflammation. Together, simultaneous down-regulation of COX-2/mPGES-1 and 5-LOX by leonurine ameliorates MSU crystal-induced inflammation through decreasing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production.

The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology.

FHV-1 can successfully evade the host innate immune response and persist for the lifetime of the cat. Several mechanisms of immune evasion by human herpesviruses have been elucidated, but the mechanism of immune evasion by FHV-1 remains unknown. In this study, we screened for FHV-1 open reading frames (ORFs) responsible for inhibiting the type I interferon (IFN) pathway with an IFN-\u03b2 promoter reporter and analysis of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels in HEK 293T cells and the Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cell line, and we identified the Ser/Thr kinase US3 as the most powerful inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that the anti-IFN activity of US3 depended on its N terminus (amino acids 1 to 75) and was independent of its kinase activity. Mechanistically, the ectopic expression of US3 selectively inhibited IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) promoter activation. Furthermore, US3 bound to the IRF association domain (IAD) of IRF3 and prevented IRF3 dimerization. Finally, US3-deleted recombinant FHV-1 and US3-repaired recombinant FHV-1 (rFHV-dUS3 and rFHV-rUS3, respectively) were constructed. Compared with wild-type FHV-1 and rFHV-rUS3, infection with rFHV-dUS3 induced large amounts of IFN-\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo More importantly, US3 deletion significantly attenuated virulence, reduced virus shedding, and blocked the invasion of trigeminal ganglia. These results indicate that FHV-1 US3 efficiently inhibits IFN induction by using a novel immune evasion mechanism and that FHV-1 US3 is a potential regulator of neurovirulence.IMPORTANCE Despite widespread vaccination, the prevalence of FHV-1 remains high, suggesting that it can successfully evade the host innate immune response and infect cats. In this study, we screened viral proteins for inhibiting the IFN pathway and identified the Ser/Thr kinase US3 as the most powerful inhibitor. In contrast to other members of the alphaherpesviruses, FHV-1 US3 blocked the host type I IFN pathway in a kinase-independent manner and via binding to the IRF3 IAD and preventing IRF3 dimerization. More importantly, the depletion of US3 attenuated the anti-IFN activity of FHV-1 and prevented efficient viral replication in vitro and in vivo Also, US3 deletion significantly attenuated virulence and blocked the invasion of trigeminal ganglia. We believe that these findings not only will help us to better understand the mechanism of how FHV-1 manipulates the host IFN response but also highlight the potential role of US3 in the establishment of latent infection in vivo.", "Keywords": ["FHV-1", "IRF3", "US3", "inhibitors", "type I IFN"], "MeSH terms": ["Alphaherpesvirinae", "Animals", "Cat Diseases", "Cats", "Dimerization", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Interferon Regulatory Factor-3", "Interferon-beta", "Membrane Proteins", "Nucleotidyltransferases", "Protein Binding", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction", "Viral Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China tj6049345@126.com qld@hvri.ac.cn."}, {"First Name": "Yongxiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jikai", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Liandong", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Division of Zoonosis of Natural Foci, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, People's Republic of China tj6049345@126.com qld@hvri.ac.cn."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2018Jun15"}, {"PMID": "29608885", "Title": "MicroRNA-223 protects neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and excessive autophagy via the Akt/mTOR pathway by targeting PARP-1.", "Abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), characterized by interruption of blood and oxygen to myocardium, is a common yet fatal cardiovascular event that causes progressive damage to myocardial tissue and eventually leads to heart failure. Previous studies have shown increased expression of microRNA-223 (miR-223) in infarcted myocardial tissues of humans and in rat models of MI. However, the role of miR-223 in cell survival during MI has not been elucidated. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether miR-223 participates in the regulation of cardiac ischemia-induced injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this process. qRT-PCR revealed that miR-223 expression levels are significantly upregulated in the myocardial tissues of rats with post-MI heart failure and in hypoxia-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and H9c2 cells, which indicates that miR-223 may be associated with chronic ischemia. We also transfected NRCMs and H9c2 cells with miR-223 mimics or inhibitors in vitro, and the results revealed that increasing miR-223 expression protected cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and excessive autophagy, whereas decreasing miR-223 expression had contrasting effects. Further exploration of the mechanism showed that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is a target gene of miR-223 and that silencing PARP-1 prevented hypoxia-induced cell injury; additionally, silencing PARP-1 blocked the aggravated impact of miR-223 inhibitors. Thus, PARP-1 mediates the protective effects of miR-223 in hypoxia-treated cardiomyocytes. We also investigated the involvement of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the above phenomena. We found that miR-223 overexpression and PARP-1 silencing positively regulated the Akt/mTOR pathway and that treating cells with NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235), a novel dual Akt/mTOR inhibitor, could reverse the inhibitory effects of both the miR-223 mimics and PARP-1 siRNA on hypoxia-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our findings showed that miR-223 protects NRCMs and H9c2 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and excessive autophagy via the Akt/mTOR pathway by targeting PARP-1; thus, miR-223 may be a potential target in the treatment of MI in the future.", "Keywords": ["Akt/mTOR signaling pathway", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "MicroRNA-223", "Myocardial infarction", "PARP-1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Base Sequence", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line", "Cytoprotection", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Models, Biological", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunfei", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yifeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

However, overdosage, misuse and drug interactions have resulted in the development of ionophore toxic syndrome. Heart and skeletal muscles have been identified as the main target organs of toxicity. In the present study, primary chicken myocardial cells were isolated to investigate the toxicity and underlying mechanisms of maduramicin. Our results showed that maduramicin causes morphological changes and a decrease in the viability of chicken myocardial cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining showed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, caspases-3/8/9 were activated at the gene and protein levels and this was accompanied by the upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, including bcl-2, bax, and cytochrome C. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (O-Me) fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk) ameliorated the apoptosis and cytotoxicity.

Here, we tested whether CYP4X1 inhibition in TAMs by flavonoid CH625 prolongs survival and normalizes glioma vasculature. CH625 was selected against the CYP4X1 3D model by virtual screening and showed inhibitory activity on the CYP4X1 catalytic production of 14,15-EET-EA in the M2-polarized human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (IC50 = 16.5 \u03bcM). CH625 improved survival and reduced tumor burden in the C6 and GL261 glioma intracranial and subcutaneous model. In addition, CH625 normalized vasculature (evidenced by a decrease in microvessel density and HIF-1\u03b1 expression and an increase in tumor perfusion, pericyte coverage, and efficacy of temozolomide therapy) accompanied with the decreased secretion of 14,15-EET-EA, VEGF, and TGF-\u03b2 in the TAMs. Furthermore, CH625 attenuated vascular abnormalization and immunosuppression induced by coimplantation of GL261 cells with CYP4X1high macrophages. In vitro TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype by CH625 inhibited proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, enhanced pericyte migration and T cell proliferation, and decreased VEGF and TGF-\u03b2 production accompanied with the downregulation of CB2 and EGFR-dependent downstream STAT3 expression. These effects were reversed by overexpression of CYP4X1 and STAT3 or exogenous addition of 14,15-EET-EA, VEGF, TGF-\u03b2, EGF, and CB2 inhibitor AM630.

In this study, we formulated curcumin-loaded MPEG-PLA (Curcumin/MPEG-PLA) micelles aiming to improve its solubility in aqueous solution and investigated anti-tumor effect on melanoma in vitro and in vivo. The spherical curcumin/MPEG-PLA micelles were completely dispersed in normal saline and could release curcumin in a sustained manner in vitro.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of resveratrol associated regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in TBI. The results demonstrated that the activation of NLRP3, caspase\u20111 and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), enhanced the production of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) following TBI. Administration of resveratrol alleviated the degree of TBI, as evidenced by the reduced neuron\u2011specific enolase\u00a0(NSE) and brain water content (WBC). Resveratrol pretreatment also inhibited the activation of NLRP3 and caspase\u20111, and reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. In addition, resveratrol further promoted SIRT1 activation. Furthermore, the suppressing effect of resveratrol on the NLRP3 inflammasome and ROS was blocked by the SIRT1 inhibitor, sirtinol. The results revealed that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent inflammatory responses in the cerebral cortex were involved in the process of TBI. Resveratrol may attenuate the inflammatory response and relieve TBI by reducing ROS production and inhibiting NLRP3 activation.

Photoacoustic imaging is one of the main techniques used in microcirculation imaging, and has the characteristics of high contrast, high detection depth and high sensitivity for tissue function. In the present paper the authors briefly introduce photoacoustic imaging and review research advances in photoacoustic imaging of microcirculation from the aspects of structure and function. The photoacoustic technique can three-dimensionally image and quantitatively examine microcirculation structure to the depth of interest tissues with high spatial resolution, and can dynamically measure total hemoglobin concentration and its oxygenation level, blood flow velocity, oxygen metabolism level, vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and hemodynamics of a target vessel in real time. Based on these factors, the prospects of the application of photoacoustic imaging are debated. The authors propose that photoacoustic imaging is appropriate for research on the sensitization of microcirculation in acupoints and can be applied to sensitized acupoints locally or in the brain, which is expected to further determine characteristic changes in the microcirculation of sensitized acupoints and enrich the specific connotation of the central sensitization of acupoints.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acupuncture Points", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Microcirculation", "Photoacoustic Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Ping-Ping", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Jia-Tong", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiao-Xia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Yi-Yuan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Xiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Gang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China. lizhigang620@126.com."}], "Journal": "Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research", "PubDate": "2017Oct25"}, {"PMID": "28992850", "Title": "Association of single-nucleotide polymorphism in the FKBP5 gene with response to steroids in pediatric patients with primary nephrotic syndrome\u2029.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FKBP5 with response to steroids in children with primary nephrotic syndrome (NS).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Genotype", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Nephrotic Syndrome", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Tacrolimus Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ni", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liangzhi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liangzhong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xianhong", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuewu", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jihong", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chunqiu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xianxiang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical nephrology", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "28983293", "Title": "Biofilm Formation and Heat Stress Induce Pyomelanin Production in Deep-Sea Pseudoalteromonas sp.

Many strains of this genus are found to be surface colonizers on marine eukaryotes and produce a wide range of pigments. However, the exact physiological role and mechanism of pigmentation were less studied. Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 (SM9913), an non-pigmented strain isolated from the deep-sea sediment, formed attached biofilm at the solid-liquid interface and pellicles at the liquid-air interface at a wide range of temperatures. Lower temperatures and lower nutrient levels promoted the formation of attached biofilm, while higher nutrient levels promoted pellicle formation of SM9913. Notably, after prolonged incubation at higher temperatures growing planktonically or at the later stage of the biofilm formation, we found that SM9913 released a brownish pigment. By comparing the protein profile at different temperatures followed by qRT-PCR, we found that the production of pigment at higher temperatures was due to the induction of melA gene which is responsible for the synthesis of homogentisic acid (HGA). The auto-oxidation of HGA can lead to the formation of pyomelanin, which has been shown in other bacteria. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer analysis confirmed that the pigment produced in SM9913 was pyomelanin-like compound. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, during heat stress and during biofilm formation, the induction level of melA gene was significantly higher than that of the hmgA gene which is responsible for the degradation of HGA in the L-tyrosine catabolism pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that the production of pyomelanin of SM9913 at elevated temperatures or during biofilm formation might be one of the adaptive responses of marine bacteria to environmental cues.", "Keywords": ["Pseudoalteromonas", "biofilm", "pellicle formation", "pyomelanin", "temperature"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhenshun", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xingsheng", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengxia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunxue", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Baiyuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, The South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of SciencesGuangzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28980322", "Title": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 attenuates calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro.", "Abstract": "Vascular calcification is a dysfunction of the vasculature.

We report the design of a unique Si-based nanocomposite of three-dimensional (3D) honeycombed graphene aerogel and the reduced graphene oxide sheets preprotected silicon secondary particles (SiNPs@rGO1). Through simple electrostatic self-assembly and hydrothermal processes, SiNPs are able to be wrapped with rGO1 to form reunited SiNPs@rGO1, and embedded into the backbone of 3D graphene honeycomb (rGO2). Such an intriguing design (namely, SiNPs@rGO1/rGO2) not only provides a conductive skeleton to improve the electrical conductivity, but also possesses abundant void spaces to accommodate the dramatic volume changes of SiNPs. Meanwhile, the outer rGO1 coats protect the inner SiNPs away from the electrolyte and prevent the destruction of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.

Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), acylsugar assembly requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3', and R2 positions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. Petunia spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a Petuniaaxillaris transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar assembly is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In P. axillaris, tetra-acylsucrose assembly occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 positions. Notably, in P. axillaris, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 positions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3' position, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3' position in tomato, is absent in P. axillaris Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays.

Cardiac sympathetic neural remodeling was assessed by immunohistochemistical study of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) immunoreactive nerve fibers. The protein expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), TH and GAP43 in the ventricular myocardium were studied by western blotting. Ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was determined to evaluate the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia. Oxidative stress was assessed by detecting the activity of superoxide dismutase and the level of malondialdehyde.

Disruption of RUNX1 activity has been implicated in the development of hematopoietic neoplasms. Chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are associated with several types of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia driven by a leukemogenic fusion protein RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Previous studies have shown that RUNX1 is an unstable protein and is subjected to proteolytic degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the precise mechanisms of RUNX1 ubiquitination have not been fully understood. Furthermore, much less is known about the mechanisms to regulate the stability of RUNX1-RUNX1T1. In this study, we identified several RUNX1-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligases using a novel high-throughput binding assay. Among them, we found that STUB1 bound to RUNX1 and induced its ubiquitination and degradation mainly in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the STUB1-induced ubiquitination also promoted nuclear export of RUNX1, which probably contributes to the reduced transcriptional activity of RUNX1 in STUB1-overexpressing cells. STUB1 also induced ubiquitination of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and down-regulated its expression. Importantly, STUB1 overexpression showed a substantial growth-inhibitory effect in myeloid leukemia cells that harbor RUNX1-RUNX1T1, whereas it showed only a marginal effect in other non-RUNX1-RUNX1T1 leukemia cells and normal human cord blood cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 is a negative regulator of both RUNX1 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1.

The step-down method and cumulative incidence function were used for model selection to determine the significant prognostic factors associated with OS and TCSS. These prognostic variables were incorporated into nomograms. An external cohort was used to validate the surgery nomograms. Seven variables were used to create the surgery nomograms for OS and TCSS, which had c-indexes of 0.709 and 0.728, respectively; for the external validation cohort, the c-indexes were 0.691 and 0.711, respectively. Nine variables were used to create the nonsurgery nomograms for OS and TCSS, which had c-indexes of 0.750 and 0.754, respectively.

There is growing interest in searching for small endogenous proteins that mediate stress responses. Here, we characterized the small C-tail-anchored inner membrane protein ElaB in E. coli ElaB belongs to a class of tail-anchored inner membrane proteins with a C-terminal transmembrane domain but lacking an N-terminal signal sequence for membrane targeting. Proteins from this family have been shown to play vital roles, such as in membrane trafficking and apoptosis, in eukaryotes; however, their role in prokaryotes is largely unexplored. Here, we found that the transcription of elaB is induced in the stationary phase in E. coli and stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS regulates elaB transcription by binding to the promoter of elaB Moreover, ElaB protects cells against oxidative stress and heat shock stress. However, unlike membrane peptide toxins TisB and GhoT, ElaB does not lead to cell death, and the deletion of elaB greatly increases persister cell formation. Therefore, we demonstrate that disruption of C-tail-anchored inner membrane proteins can reduce stress resistance; it can also lead to deleterious effects, such as increased persistence, in E. coliIMPORTANCEEscherichia coli synthesizes dozens of poorly understood small membrane proteins containing a predicted transmembrane domain. In this study, we characterized the function of the C-tail-anchored inner membrane protein ElaB in E. coli ElaB increases resistance to oxidative stress and heat stress, while inactivation of ElaB leads to high persister cell formation.

The method was based on the transformation of Amplex Red into a highly fluorescent and colored resorufin catalyzed by laccase in the presence of O2. The catalysis and transformation mechanism were investigated in detail. The kinetic parameters of the Amplex Red catalysis by laccase were determined using the Lineweaver-Burk equation. Vmax and Km were estimated to be 15.63\u03bcmolmin-1 and 76.88\u03bcmolL-1, respectively. Under optimal conditions, a good linear correlation was found between fluorescence intensity and laccase activities within 5.62-702UL-1 (r=0.9992), with a detection limit of 1.76UL-1 (S/N=3). A series of repeatability measurements (351UL-1 laccase) gave reproducible results with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.9% (n=11). The recoveries ranged from 93.7% to 100.0% after standard additions. Common existing species such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Al3+, Co2+, Cd2+, K+, Ca2+, Na+, Fe3+, Li+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, l-lysine, glycine, glucose, phenol, humic acid, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase alkaline phosphatase, cellulose, glucose oxidase, urease, catalase, invertase, and horseradish peroxidase did not significantly exhibit interference. The test solution (i.e., Amplex Red stock solution) could stabilize at least three months via storage in dark at 4\u00b10.1\u00b0C. These results confirmed that the laccase-Amplex Red system was stable and reproducible with strong anti-interference ability and good selectivity, suggesting that this method can has great potential in practical applications for the assay of laccase activity. The proposed method was further successfully used to detect laccase activities in 38 soil samples. We noticed that the laccase activity significantly correlated with total nitrogen content (r=0.559; p<0.01) of soil, indicating laccase activity assay holds great promise as an index of soil analysis.

Early detection and accurate prediction of ADRs is thus vital for drug development and patient safety. Multiple scientific disciplines, namely pharmacology, pharmacovigilance, and pharmacoinformatics, have been addressing the ADR problem from different perspectives. With the same goal of improving drug safety, this article summarizes and links the research efforts in the multiple disciplines into a single framework from comprehensive understanding of the interactions between drugs and biological system and the identification of genetic and phenotypic predispositions of patients susceptible to higher ADR risks and finally to the current state of implementation of medication-related decision support systems. We start by describing available computational resources for building drug-target interaction networks with biological annotations, which provides a fundamental knowledge for ADR prediction. Databases are classified by functions to help users in selection. Post-marketing surveillance is then introduced where data-driven approach can not only enhance the prediction accuracy of ADRs but also enables the discovery of genetic and phenotypic risk factors of ADRs. Understanding genetic risk factors for ADR requires well organized patient genetics information and analysis by pharmacogenomic approaches. Finally, current state of clinical decision support systems is presented and described how clinicians can be assisted with the integrated knowledgebase to minimize the risk of ADR.

In this study, we discovered a novel cold adaptation mechanism in Shewanella oneidensis that occurs at the DNA level and is regulated by cryptic prophage excision. Previous studies on bacterial cold tolerance mainly focus on the structural change of cell membrane and changes at the RNA and protein levels. Whether or not genomic change can also contribute to this process has not been explored. Here we employed a whole-genome deep-sequencing method to probe the changes at DNA level in a model psychrotrophic bacteria strain. We found that temperature downshift induced a 10\u2009000-fold increase of the excision of a novel P4-like cryptic prophage. Importantly, although prophage excision only occurred in a relatively small population of bacteria, it was able to facilitate biofilm formation and promote the survival of the entire population. This prophage excision affected cell physiology by disrupting a critical gene encoding transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). In addition, we found that the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) could silence prophage excision via binding to the promoter of the putative excisionase gene at warm temperatures. H-NS level was reduced at cold temperatures, leading to de-repression of prophage excision.

However, due to its poor aqueous solubility and low biological availability, the clinical application of Cur is quite limited. The encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs into nanoparticles is an effective way to improve their pharmaceutical activities. In this research, nanomicelles loaded with Cur were formulated by a self-assembly method with biodegradable monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) copolymers (MPEG-PLAs). After encapsulation, the cellular uptake was increased and Cur could be released from MPEG-PLA micelles in a sustained manner. The Cur-loaded MPEG-PLA micelles (Cur/MPEG-PLA micelles) exhibited an enhanced toxicity on C6 and U251 glioma cells and induced more apoptosis on C6 glioma cells compared with free Cur. Moreover, the therapy efficiency of Cur/MPEG-PLA micelles was evaluated at length on a nude mouse model bearing glioma.

These enzymes were used--in concert with two previously identified BAHD acyltransferases--to reconstruct the entire cultivated tomato acylsucrose biosynthetic pathway in vitro using sucrose and acyl-CoA substrates. Comparative genomics and biochemical analysis of ASAT enzymes were combined with in vitro mutagenesis to identify amino acids that influence CoA ester substrate specificity and contribute to differences in types of acylsucroses that accumulate in cultivated and wild tomato species.

Additionally, the presence of rac genes increases cell lysis during biofilm development. In most E. coli strains, rac is integrated into the ttcA gene which encodes a tRNA-thioltransferase. Rac excision in E. coli K-12 leads to a functional change of TtcA, which results in reduced fitness in the presence of carbenicillin. Additionally, we demonstrate that YdaQ (renamed as XisR) is the excisionase of rac in E. coli K-12, and that rac excision is induced by the stationary sigma factor RpoS through inducing xisR expression. Taken together, our results reveal that upon rac integration, not only are new genes introduced into the host, but also there is a functional change in a host enzyme.

However, related studies in the ecologically and bioelectrochemically important strain Shewanella oneidensis are limited. Here, we show that SO_3166, a member of the higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding (HEPN) superfamily, strongly inhibited cell growth in S. oneidensis and Escherichia coli. SO_3165, a putative minimal nucleotidyltransferase (MNT), neutralized the toxicity of SO_3166. Gene SO_3165 lies upstream of SO_3166, and they are co-transcribed. Moreover, the SO_3165 and SO_3166 proteins interact with each other directly in vivo, and antitoxin SO_3165 bound to the promoter of the TA operon and repressed its activity. Finally, the conserved Rx4-6H domain in HEPN family was identified in SO_3166. Mutating either the R or H abolished SO_3166 toxicity, confirming that Rx4-6H domain is critical for SO_3166 activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SO_3166 and SO_3165 in S. oneidensis form a typical type II TA pair. This TA pair plays a critical role in regulating bacterial functions because its disruption led to impaired cell motility in S. oneidensis. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that HEPN-MNT can function as a TA system, thereby providing important insights into the understanding of the function and regulation of HEPNs and MNTs in prokaryotes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Toxins", "DNA, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Nucleotidyltransferases", "Operon", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Shewanella", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianyun", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunxue", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenshun", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510301, China."}], "Journal": "Microbial biotechnology", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26111390", "Title": "Low-Rank Atlas Image Analyses in the Presence of Pathologies.", "Abstract": "We present a common framework, for registering images to an atlas and for forming an unbiased atlas, that tolerates the presence of pathologies such as tumors and traumatic brain injury lesions. This common framework is particularly useful when a sufficient number of protocol-matched scans from healthy subjects cannot be easily acquired for atlas formation and when the pathologies in a patient cause large appearance changes. Our framework combines a low-rank-plus-sparse image decomposition technique with an iterative, diffeomorphic, group-wise image registration method. At each iteration of image registration, the decomposition technique estimates a \"healthy\" version of each image as its low-rank component and estimates the pathologies in each image as its sparse component. The healthy version of each image is used for the next iteration of image registration. The low-rank and sparse estimates are refined as the image registrations iteratively improve. For unbiased atlas formation, at each iteration, the average of the low-rank images from the patients is used as the atlas image for the next iteration, until convergence. Since each iteration's atlas is comprised of low-rank components, it provides a population-consistent, pathology-free appearance.

"Docetaxel (DOC) produces anti-tumor effects by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell growth. However, its clinical application is limited by its hydrophobicity and low biocompatibility. Therefore, improving DOC's water solubility, biocompatibility, and anti-tumor effects are important goals that will improve its clinical utility. In this work, DOC and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG)/polycaprolactone (PCL) (MPEG-PCL) showed good compatibility through computer simulations. We prepared DOC-loaded polymeric micelles (DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles) with drug loading of 6.82% and encapsulation efficiency of 98.36%; these were monodispersed and approximately 30\u00a0nm in diameter, and released DOC over an extended period in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. In addition, DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis more effectively than free DOC in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles inhibited ovarian tumor growth more significantly than free DOC. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles improved DOC's anti-tumor effect by enhancing tumor cell apoptosis and suppressing tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, in bio-imaging analysis, DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles showed a higher concentration and a longer retention time in ovarian tumor tissue than did free DOC, indicating that the DOC/MPEG-PCL micelles delivered more anti-tumor drug to the tumor.

Interestingly, our in vitro digestion experiments demonstrate that phytase attached to the cell surface is a more efficient enzyme than secreted phytase.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["6-Phytase", "Animal Feed", "Citrobacter", "Enzyme Stability", "Flow Cytometry", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Organisms, Genetically Modified", "Pichia", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Temperature", "Transformation, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Guangdong Key Laboratory of Fermentation and Enzyme Engineering, School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510006, P.

Preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) guided by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was employed for the isolation and purification of the active components, and three new compounds with half inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.11, 0.17, and 0.14 mM against diphenolase were obtained from the extract, respectively. Their chemical structures were identified by HRMS, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy as paecilomycones A, B, and C. Structure and activity studies showed that the tyrosinase inhibition activities are positively related to the number of hydroxyl groups on the paecilomycones.", "Keywords": ["Paecilomyces gunnii", "phenalenones", "tyrosinase inhibition"], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Factors", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Countercurrent Distribution", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Molecular Structure", "Monophenol Monooxygenase", "Paecilomyces", "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruili", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Anhui Agricultural University , Hefei, Anhui 230036, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sha", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wancun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fenglin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Longyun", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guanhu", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chunru", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zengzhi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "PubDate": "2014Dec10"}, {"PMID": "25335742", "Title": "Microvessel density as a prognostic factor in bladder cancer: a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that microvessel density (MVD) could play a potential value as prognostic biomarkers of tumors.
