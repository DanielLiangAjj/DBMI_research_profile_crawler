For example, different DNA extraction kits may have different efficiency for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These variable efficiencies, combined with technical variation, create strong processing biases, which impede the identification of signals that are reproducible across studies and the development of generalizable and biologically interpretable prediction models. \"Batch-correction\" methods have been used to alleviate these issues computationally with some success. However, many make strong parametric assumptions which do not necessarily apply to microbiome data or processing biases, or require the use of an outcome variable, which risks overfitting. Lastly and importantly, existing transformations used to correct microbiome data are largely non-interpretable, and could, for example, introduce values to features that were initially mostly zeros. Altogether, processing bias currently compromises our ability to glean robust and generalizable biological insights from microbiome data. Here, we present DEBIAS-M (Domain adaptation with phenotype Estimation and Batch Integration Across Studies of the Microbiome), an interpretable framework for inference and correction of processing bias, which facilitates domain adaptation in microbiome studies. DEBIAS-M learns bias-correction factors for each microbe in each batch that simultaneously minimize batch effects and maximize cross-study associations with phenotypes. Using benchmarks of HIV and colorectal cancer classification from gut microbiome data, and cervical neoplasia prediction from cervical microbiome data, we demonstrate that DEBIAS-M outperforms batch-correction methods commonly used in the field. Notably, we show that the inferred bias-correction factors are stable, interpretable, and strongly associated with specific experimental protocols. Overall, we show that DEBIAS-M allows for better modeling of microbiome data and identification of interpretable signals that are reproducible across studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George I", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aya Brown", "Last Name": "Kav", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heekuk", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Biermann", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Korem", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Feb12"}, {"PMID": "38278517", "Title": "Periodontitis and brain magnetic resonance imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive aging.", "Abstract": "We examined the association of clinical, microbiological, and host response features of periodontitis with MRI markers of atrophy/cerebrovascular disease in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) Ancillary Study of Oral Health.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "inflammation", "magnetic resonance imaging", "oral health", "oral microbiome", "periodontitis"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Aging", "Brain", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Periodontitis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Rubinstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Periodontics, Section of Oral, Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Burkett", "Affiliation": "Division of Periodontics, Section of Oral, Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heekuk", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and, Surgeons, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Medini K", "Last Name": "Annavajhala", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and, Surgeons, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and, Surgeons, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruce J", "Last Name": "Paster", "Affiliation": "The Forsyth Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Panos N", "Last Name": "Papapanou", "Affiliation": "Division of Periodontics, Section of Oral, Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "37939186", "Title": "Mapping the genomic landscape of multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and its impact on parasite fitness.", "Abstract": "Drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites have swept across Southeast Asia and now threaten Africa.

Despite their prevalence, plasmids can impose long-term fitness costs on their hosts, altering population structure, growth dynamics, and evolutionary outcomes. In addition to long-term fitness costs, acquiring a new plasmid introduces an immediate, short-term perturbation to the cell. However, due to the transient nature of this plasmid acquisition cost, a quantitative understanding of its physiological manifestations, overall magnitudes, and population-level implications, remains unclear. To address this, here we track growth of single colonies immediately following plasmid acquisition. We find that plasmid acquisition costs are primarily driven by changes in lag time, rather than growth rate, for nearly 60 conditions covering diverse plasmids, selection environments, and clinical strains/species. Surprisingly, for a costly plasmid, clones exhibiting longer lag times also achieve faster recovery growth rates, suggesting an evolutionary tradeoff. Modeling and experiments demonstrate that this tradeoff leads to counterintuitive ecological dynamics, whereby intermediate-cost plasmids outcompete both their low and high-cost counterparts. These results suggest that, unlike fitness costs, plasmid acquisition dynamics are not uniformly driven by minimizing growth disadvantages. Moreover, a lag/growth tradeoff has clear implications in predicting the ecological outcomes and intervention strategies of bacteria undergoing conjugation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Plasmids", "Bacteria", "Gene Transfer, Horizontal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mehrose", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Prensky", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Balestrieri", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shahd", "Last Name": "ElNaggar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Gomez-Simmonds", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Traxler", "Affiliation": "Department Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abhyudai", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 19717, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison J", "Last Name": "Lopatkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Barnard College, New York, NY, 10027, USA. allison.lopatkin@rochester.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2023Apr24"}, {"PMID": "36963402", "Title": "Mitigating the risk of antimalarial resistance via covalent dual-subunit inhibition of the Plasmodium proteasome.", "Abstract": "The Plasmodium falciparum proteasome constitutes a promising antimalarial target, with multiple chemotypes potently and selectively inhibiting parasite proliferation and synergizing with the first-line artemisinin drugs, including against artemisinin-resistant parasites.

However, the virulence strategies employed by these pathogens remain elusive. Here, we study the interaction of ECC clinical isolates with human serum to define how this pathogen evades the antimicrobial action of complement, one of the first lines of host-mediated immune defense. We identified a small number of serum-sensitive strains, including Enterobacter hormaechei strain NR3055, which we exploited for the in vitro selection of serum-resistant clones. Comparative genomics between the serum-sensitive NR3055 strain and the isolated serum-resistant clones revealed a premature stop codon in the wzy gene of the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus of NR3055. The complementation of wzy conferred serum resistance to NR3055, prevented the deposition of complement proteins on the bacterial surface, inhibited phagocytosis by human neutrophils, and rendered the bacteria virulent in a mouse model of peritonitis. Mice exposed to a nonlethal dose of encapsulated NR3055 were protected from subsequent lethal infections by encapsulated NR3055, whereas mice that were previously exposed to unencapsulated NR3055 succumbed to infection. Thus, capsule is a key immune evasion determinant for E. hormaechei, and it is a potential target for prophylactics and therapeutics to combat these increasingly MDR human pathogens. IMPORTANCE Infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria are of increasing concern, especially those due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. Included in this group are species of the Enterobacter cloacae complex, regarding which there is a paucity of knowledge on the infection biology of the pathogens, despite their clinical relevance. In this study, we combine techniques in comparative genomics, bacterial genetics, and diverse models of infection to establish capsule as an important mechanism of Enterobacter pathogens to resist the antibacterial activity of serum, a first line of host defense against bacterial infections. We also show that immune memory targeting the Enterobacter capsule protects against lethal infection. The further characterization of Enterobacter infection biology and the immune response to infection are needed for the development of therapies and preventative interventions targeting these highly antibiotic resistant pathogens.", "Keywords": ["Enterobacter", "antimicrobial resistance", "capsule", "complement", "pathogenesis", "serum", "serum resistance"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Virulence", "Enterobacter", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Polysaccharides", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amelia", "Last Name": "St John", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew I", "Last Name": "Perault", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina I", "Last Name": "Giacometti", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexis G", "Last Name": "Sommerfield", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley L", "Last Name": "DuMont", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keenan A", "Last Name": "Lacey", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuhui", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Sproch", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Petzold", "Affiliation": "Microscopy Laboratory, Division of Advanced Research Technologies, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Dancel-Manning", "Affiliation": "Microscopy Laboratory, Division of Advanced Research Technologies, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Medini", "Last Name": "Annavajhala", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Beckford", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Zeitouni", "Affiliation": "Icahn Genomics Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Feng-Xia", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Microscopy Laboratory, Division of Advanced Research Technologies, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harm", "Last Name": "van Bakel", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Shopsin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Pironti", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor J", "Last Name": "Torres", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2023Apr25"}, {"PMID": "36717332", "Title": "The gut microbiome, short chain fatty acids, and related metabolites in cystic fibrosis patients with and without colonic adenomas.", "Abstract": "Adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk for colon cancer.

"Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful against COVID-19 (refs. 1,2). However, because SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities3-9, there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here we examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both and their sequences showed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment peformed with many replicates, 53\u2009independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23\u2009different residues of the enzyme. Nevertheless, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13\u2009recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones showed that these mutations mediated only low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (around 100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I.

However, the introduction and spread of MSSA, the role of systematic decolonization, and optimal infection prevention and control strategies remain incompletely understood. We previously screened infants hospitalized in a university-affiliated level III to IV NICU twice monthly over 18\u2009months for S. aureus colonization and identified several prevalent staphylococcal protein A (spa) types. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic comparisons of 140 isolates from predominant spa types t279, t1451, and t571 to examine possible transmission routes and identify genomic and epidemiologic features associated with the spread of dominant clones. We identified two major MSSA clones: sequence type 398 (ST398), common in the local community, and ST1898, not previously encountered in the region. ST398 NICU isolates formed distinct clusters with closely related community isolates from previously published data sets, suggesting multiple sources of acquisition, such as family members or staff, including residents of the local community. In contrast, ST1898 isolates were nearly identical, pointing to clonal expansion within the NICU. Almost all ST1898 isolates harbored plasmids encoding mupirocin resistance (mupA), suggesting an association between the proliferation of this clone and decolonization efforts with mupirocin. Comparative genomics indicated genotype-specific pathways of introduction and spread of MSSA via community-associated (ST398) or health care-associated (ST1898) sources and the potential role of mupirocin resistance in dissemination of ST1898. Future surveillance efforts could benefit from routine genotyping to inform clone-specific infection prevention strategies. IMPORTANCE Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is a significant pathogen in neonates. However, surveillance efforts in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have focused primarily on methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), limiting our understanding of colonizing and infectious MSSA clones which are prevalent in the NICU. Here, we identify two dominant colonizing MSSA clones during an 18-month surveillance effort in a level III to IV NICU, ST398 and ST1898. Using genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analysis, coupled with epidemiological investigation, we found that these two sequence types had distinct modes of spread, namely the suggested exchange with community reservoirs for ST398 and the contribution of antibiotic resistance to dissemination of ST1898 in the health care setting.

Perturbations to the intestinal microbiome are common in patients undergoing liver transplant (LT); however, the impacts of microbial diversity and composition on risk of CDI in this patient population is incompletely understood. Here, we assessed patients in an established, longitudinal LT cohort for development of CDI within 1 year of transplant. Clinical data were compared for patients with and without CDI using univariable models. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed at multiple pre- and posttransplant time points to compare microbiome \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity and enrichment of specific taxa in patients with and without CDI. Of 197 patients who underwent LT, 18 (9.1%) developed CDI within 1 year. Pre-LT Child-Pugh class C liver disease, postoperative biliary leak, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly associated with CDI. Patients who developed CDI had significantly lower \u03b1-diversity than patients without CDI overall and in samples collected at months 1, 3, and 6. Microbial composition (\u03b2-diversity) differed between patients with and without CDI and across sampling time points, particularly later in their posttransplant course. We also identified 15 (8%) patients with toxigenic C. difficile colonization who did not develop CDI and may have had additional protective factors. In summary, clinical and microbiome factors are likely to converge to impart CDI risk. Along with enhanced preventive measures, there may be a role for microbiome modulation to restore microbial diversity in high-risk LT patients. IMPORTANCE Liver transplant (LT) recipients have high rates of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which has been associated with poor outcomes, including graft-related complications and mortality, in prior studies. Susceptibility to CDI is known to increase following perturbations in intestinal commensal bacteria that enable germination of C. difficile spores and bacterial overgrowth. In LT patients, changes in the intestinal microbiome resulting from advanced liver disease, surgery, and other clinical factors is common and most pronounced during the early posttransplant period.

However, as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities 3\u00e2\u20ac\"9 , there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here, we have examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in increasing concentrations of nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale in 480 wells. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both, and their sequences revealed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment done at a larger scale with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Yet, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L, or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones, each containing a unique mutation or a combination of mutations showed that the above precursor mutations only mediated low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (~100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Structural explanations are discussed for some of the mutations that are proximal to the drug-binding site, as well as cross-resistance or lack thereof to ensitrelvir, another clinically important 3CL protease inhibitor. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro , and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next generation protease inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Mohri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Culbertson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seo Jung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yinkai", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria I", "Last Name": "Luck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Medini K", "Last Name": "Annavajhala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yicheng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zizhang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yosef", "Last Name": "Sabo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Haitao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2022Aug18"}, {"PMID": "35582905", "Title": "Partial ORF1ab Gene Target Failure with Omicron BA.2.12.1.", "Abstract": "Mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 can affect the performance of molecular diagnostic assays.

We predicted that the metabolic stress induced by the bacteria in the host cells shapes an immune response that tolerates infection.

The relative contributions of antibiotic use and alloreactivity to microbiome dynamics have not yet been elucidated, however. There is a lack of data on the kinetics of microbiome changes beyond 30 days post-transplantation and how they might differ between different transplantation modalities. A direct comparison of the differential effects of auto-HCT and allo-HCT on the microbiome may shed light on these dynamics. This study was conducted to compare intestinal microbial diversity between auto-HCT recipients and allo-HCT recipients from pre-transplantation to 100 days post-transplantation, and to examine the effect of antibiotics,\u00a0transplant type\u00a0(auto versus allo), and conditioning regimens on the dynamics of microbiome recovery. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of changes in the intestinal microbiome in 35 patients undergoing HCT (17 auto-HCT, 18 allo-HCT) at 4 time points: pre-conditioning and 14, 28, and 100 days post-transplantation. Granular data on antibiotic exposure from day -30 pre-transplantation to day +100 post-transplantation were collected. Pre-transplantation, allo-HCT recipients had lower \u03b1-diversity in the intestinal microbiome compared with auto-HCT recipients, which correlated with greater pre-transplantation antibiotic use in allo-HCT recipients. The microbiome diversity declined at days +14 and +28 post-transplantation in both cohorts but generally returned to baseline by day +100. Conditioning regimen intensity did not significantly affect post-transplantation \u03b1-diversity. Through differential abundance analysis, we show that commensal bacterial taxa involved with maintenance of gut epithelial integrity and production of short-chain fatty acids were depleted after both auto-HCT and allo-HCT. In our dataset, antibiotic exposure was the major driver of post-transplantation microbiome changes rather than alloreactivity, conditioning intensity, or immunosuppression. Our findings also suggest that interventions to limit microbiome injury, such as limiting the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, should target the pre-transplantation period and not only the peri-transplantation period.", "Keywords": ["Allogeneic transplantation", "Antibiotics", "Autologous transplantation", "Microbiome"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rajat", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Heekuk", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cristian C", "Last Name": "Taborda", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Gordillo", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Amer", "Last Name": "Assal", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "Reshef", "Affiliation": "Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.

MRSA secretes a number of virulence factors and pore-forming toxins that enable tissue invasion. Prior studies have found associations between decreased toxin production and poor outcomes in invasive MRSA infection, particularly in pneumonia. In this retrospective observational cohort study of MRSA bacteremia in adult patients from 2007 to 2015, we examined whether cytotoxicity was associated with 30-day mortality. Isolates were obtained from 776 patients and screened for cytotoxicity in a human HL-60 cell model, antimicrobial susceptibility, and spa type, and clinical data were abstracted from charts. We did not find an association between low cytotoxic activity and 30-day mortality in univariate logistic regression analyses. There was a difference in distribution of the genotypes across cytotoxicity phenotypes, with spa-CC008 accounting for a larger proportion of isolates in the high cytotoxicity group. Isolates with a skin and soft tissue primary infective site had a higher median cytotoxicity. There was no association between cytotoxicity and host factors such as age or comorbidity burden. The isolates in our study came from heterogeneous primary sites of infection and were predominantly from spa-CC002 and spa-CC008 lineages, so it is possible that findings in prior studies reflect a different distribution in genotypes and clinical syndromes. Overall, in this large study of cytotoxicity of MRSA bloodstream isolates, we did not find the low cytotoxicity phenotype to be predictive of poor outcomes in MRSA bacteremia.", "Keywords": ["MRSA", "Staphylococcus aureus", "cytotoxicity", "mortality", "virulence"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteremia", "Humans", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Retrospective Studies", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Virulence Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas H", "Last Name": "McConville", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eloise D", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenjing", "Last Name": "Geng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiuhu", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology, New York Medical Collegegrid.260917.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Divya", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine J", "Last Name": "Kubin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor J", "Last Name": "Torres", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy", "PubDate": "2022Jan18"}, {"PMID": "34647864", "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 RNA Shedding in Semen and Oligozoospermia of Patient with Severe Coronavirus Disease 11 Weeks after Infection.", "Abstract": "We report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in semen by using quantitative reverse transcription PCR during the late convalescent phase.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant5), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%.

To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, we conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 69 COVID-19 decedents. Of six cardiac histopathologic features, microthrombi was the most commonly detected (n=48, 70%). We tested associations of cardiac microthrombi with biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and fibrinolysis and with in-hospital antiplatelet therapy, therapeutic anticoagulation, and corticosteroid treatment, while adjusting for multiple clinical factors, including COVID-19 therapies. Higher peak ESR and CRP during hospitalization were independently associated with higher odds of microthrombi. Using single nuclei RNA-sequence analysis, we discovered an enrichment of pro-thrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune-potentiating signaling amongst cardiac fibroblasts in microthrombi-positive COVID-19 hearts relative to microthrombi-negative COVID-19. Non-COVID-19 non-failing hearts were used as reference controls.

Screening of a set of PRS ATP-site binders, initially designed for human indications, led to identification of 1-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives representing a novel antimalarial scaffold. Evidence designates cytoplasmic PRS as the drug target. The frontrunner 1 and its active enantiomer 1-S exhibited low-double-digit nanomolar activity against resistant Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) laboratory strains and development of liver schizonts. No cross-resistance with strains resistant to other known antimalarials was noted. In addition, a similar level of growth inhibition was observed against clinical field isolates of Pf and P. vivax. The slow killing profile and the relative high propensity to develop resistance in vitro (minimum inoculum resistance of 8 \u00d7 105 parasites at a selection pressure of 3 \u00d7 IC50) constitute unfavorable features for treatment of malaria. However, potent blood stage and antischizontal activity are compelling for causal prophylaxis which does not require fast onset of action. Achieving sufficient on-target selectivity appears to be particularly challenging and should be the primary focus during the next steps of optimization of this chemical series. Encouraging preliminary off-target profile and oral efficacy in a humanized murine model of Pf malaria allowed us to conclude that 1-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives represent a promising starting point for the identification of novel antimalarial prophylactic agents that selectively target Plasmodium PRS.", "Keywords": ["PRS", "Plasmodium", "malaria", "prolyl-tRNA synthetase"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Humans", "Malaria", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Mice", "Plasmodium falciparum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Masanori", "Last Name": "Okaniwa", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Akira", "Last Name": "Shibata", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Atsuko", "Last Name": "Ochida", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuichiro", "Last Name": "Akao", "Affiliation": "Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, 26-1, Muraoka-Higashi 2-chome, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Karen L", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Shackleford", "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Duffy", "Affiliation": "Discovery Biology, Griffith University, Brisbane Innovation Park, Don Young Road, Nathan, Queensland 4111, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leonardo", "Last Name": "Lucantoni", "Affiliation": "Discovery Biology, Griffith University, Brisbane Innovation Park, Don Young Road, Nathan, Queensland 4111, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sumanta", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}, {"First Name": "Josefine", "Last Name": "Striepen", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Yeo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sachel", "Last Name": "Mok", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anna Caroline C", "Last Name": "Aguiar", "Affiliation": "Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Av.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

While whole-genome sequencing has helped identify genetic changes underlying resistance, functional validation remains difficult due to a lack of genetic manipulation systems for MDR K.\u00a0pneumoniae.

Itaconate inhibits S. aureus glycolysis and selects for strains that re-direct carbon flux to fuel extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis and biofilm formation. Itaconate-adapted strains, as illustrated by S. aureus isolates from chronic airway infection, exhibit decreased glycolytic activity, high EPS production, and proficient biofilm formation even before itaconate stimulation.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature mutations of concern are E484K, which plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here, we report the emergence of variant lineage B.1.526 that contains E484K and its alarming rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and less susceptible to neutralization by convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The B.1.526 lineage has now been reported from all 50 states in the US and numerous other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York upon its emergence, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. Such transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, likely contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526.

Plasmid fitness costs are known to impact long-term growth dynamics of microbial populations by providing plasmid-carrying cells a relative (dis)advantage compared to plasmid-free counterparts. Separately, plasmid acquisition introduces an immediate, but transient, metabolic perturbation. However, the impact of these short-term effects on subsequent growth dynamics has not previously been established. Here, we observed that de novo transconjugants grew significantly slower and/or with overall prolonged lag times, compared to lineages that had been replicating for several generations, indicating the presence of a plasmid acquisition cost. These effects were general to diverse incompatibility groups, well-characterized and clinically captured plasmids, Gram-negative recipient strains and species, and experimental conditions. Modeling revealed that both fitness and acquisition costs modulate overall conjugation dynamics, validated with previously published data. These results suggest that the hours immediately following conjugation may play a critical role in both short- and long-term plasmid prevalence.

Positive results were confirmed by electron microscopy and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). During delivery, only one woman had symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, six women reported previous symptoms, and 68 women were asymptomatic. All neonates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 as per nasopharyngeal swab PCR results. Obstetric histories were unremarkable in 29 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 8 of 75 SARS-CoV-2-negative women.\u00a0Placental examination was normal in 12 of 75 infected and 3 of 75 uninfected subjects, respectively. In the remaining cases, placental pathology correlated with obstetric comorbidities without significant differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative women. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in one placenta of an infected, but asymptomatic, parturient. Viral staining was predominantly localized to the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) which demonstrated marked damage accompanied by perivillous fibrin deposition and mixed intervillositis. A significant decrease of viral titers was detected in the attached umbilical cord compared with the villous parenchyma as per qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is seldom identified in placentas of infected women.

Therefore, here we adapt a CRISPR-Cas9 system to CRKP to elucidate how mutations in clinical CRKP isolates induce PR. We demonstrate that CrrB is a positive regulator of PR, and common clinical mutations lead to the addition of both 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) and phosophethanolamine (pEtN) to lipid A, inducing notably higher polymyxin minimum inhibitory concentrations than mgrB disruption.

Here we report the clinical and histologic findings related to the liver in 40 patients who died of complications of COVID-19. A subset of liver tissue blocks were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Peak levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated; median ALT peak 68\u2009U/l (normal up to 46\u2009U/l) and median AST peak 102\u2009U/l (normal up to 37\u2009U/l). Macrovesicular steatosis was the most common finding, involving 30 patients (75%). Mild lobular necroinflammation and portal inflammation were present in 20 cases each (50%). Vascular pathology, including sinusoidal microthrombi, was infrequent, seen in six cases (15%). PCR of liver tissue was positive in 11 of 20 patients tested (55%).

of Genomic Data.", "Abstract": "Polymyxins are used as treatments of last resort for Gram-negative bacterial infections. Their increased use has led to concerns about emerging polymyxin resistance (PR). Phenotypic polymyxin susceptibility testing is resource intensive and difficult to perform accurately. The complex polygenic nature of PR and our incomplete understanding of its genetic basis make it difficult to predict PR using detection of resistance determinants. We therefore applied machine learning (ML) to whole-genome sequencing data from >600 Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258 (CG258) genomes to predict phenotypic PR. Using a reference-based representation of genomic data with ML outperformed a rule-based approach that detected variants in known PR genes (area under receiver-operator curve [AUROC], 0.894 versus 0.791, P\u2009=\u20090.006). We noted modest increases in performance by using a bacterial genome-wide association study to filter relevant genomic features and by integrating clinical data in the form of prior polymyxin exposure. Conversely, reference-free representation of genomic data as k-mers was associated with decreased performance (AUROC, 0.692 versus 0.894, P\u2009=\u20090.015). When ML models were interpreted to extract genomic features, six of seven known PR genes were correctly identified by models without prior programming and several genes involved in stress responses and maintenance of the cell membrane were identified as potential novel determinants of PR. These findings are a proof of concept that whole-genome sequencing data can accurately predict PR in K. pneumoniae CG258 and may be applicable to other forms of complex antimicrobial resistance.IMPORTANCE Polymyxins are last-resort antibiotics used to treat highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria. There are increasing reports of polymyxin resistance emerging, raising concerns of a postantibiotic era. Polymyxin resistance is therefore a significant public health threat, but current phenotypic methods for detection are difficult and time-consuming to perform. There have been increasing efforts to use whole-genome sequencing for detection of antibiotic resistance, but this has been difficult to apply to polymyxin resistance because of its complex polygenic nature. The significance of our research is that we successfully applied machine learning methods to predict polymyxin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258, a common health care-associated and multidrug-resistant pathogen. Our findings highlight that machine learning can be successfully applied even in complex forms of antibiotic resistance and represent a significant contribution to the literature that could be used to predict resistance in other bacteria and to other antibiotics.", "Keywords": ["antimicrobial resistance", "genotype", "machine learning", "phenotype", "prediction"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nenad", "Last Name": "Macesic", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA nenad.macesic@monash.edu au2110@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Bear Don't Walk", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Itsik", "Last Name": "Pe'er", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anton Y", "Last Name": "Peleg", "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, The Alfred Hospital and Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA nenad.macesic@monash.edu au2110@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mSystems", "PubDate": "2020May26"}, {"PMID": "32430060", "Title": "Meningomyeloencephalitis secondary to Mycobacterium haemophilum infection in AIDS.", "Abstract": "Infections by opportunistic non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are rising in global incidence.

Detection of this microorganism is difficult using conventional culture-based methods and few reports have documented involvement of this pathogen within the central nervous system (CNS).We describe the neuropathologic autopsy findings of a 39-year-old man with AIDS who died secondary to M. haemophilum CNS infection. He initially presented with repeated bouts of pyrexia, nausea and vomiting, and altered mental status that required numerous hospitalizations. CSF infectious workups were consistently negative. His most recent admission identified hyperintensities within the brainstem by MRI and despite antibiotic therapies for suspected CNS infection, he died. Autopsy revealed a swollen brain with marked widening of the brainstem. Microscopic examination of the brain and spinal cord showed focal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and neuronal loss that were associated with acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The brainstem was the most severely damaged and AFB were found to congregate along arterial territories lending support to the notion of hematogenous spread as a mechanism for the organisms' dissemination. 16S rRNA sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue enabled post-mortem identification of M. haemophilum.

We aimed to determine the relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort (n\u2009=\u200952) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS+) bacteria previously linked to inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe periodontitis. Fungal \u03b1-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and plaque from patients with a history of AIDS.

However, despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients.

These methods were evaluated using a cohort of contemporary, clinical Gram-negative bacillus isolates from 3 U.S. academic medical centers (126 isolates of the Enterobacterales, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and 50 Acinetobacter species isolates; 1 isolate was mcr positive) and 12 mcr-positive CDC-FDA Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Isolate Bank isolates for which reference broth microdilution colistin susceptibility results were available. Eleven (4.6%) isolates were strongly positive by the MCR-1 LFA, with an additional 8 (3.4%) isolates yielding faintly positive results. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for MCR-1 detection were 100% and 96.1%, respectively. Upon repeat testing, only a single false-positive MCR-2 producer remained, as the isolates with initially faintly positive results were negative. The EDTA-CBDE screening method had an overall PPA and NPA of 100% and 94.3%, respectively. The NPA for the EDTA-CBDE method was slightly lower at 94.2% with Enterobacterales, whereas it was 96.0% with P. aeruginosa The MCR-1 LFA and EDTA-CBDE methods are both accurate and user-friendly methods for the detection of PMCR.

We hypothesized that increased abundance of nitrate-reducing oral bacteria would be associated with lower levels of cardiometabolic risk cross-sectionally. Methods and Results ORIGINS (Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance, and Insulin Resistance Study) enrolled 300 diabetes mellitus-free adults aged 20 to 55\u00a0years (mean=34\u00b110 years) (78% women). Microbial DNA was extracted from subgingival dental plaque (n=281) and V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to measure the relative abundances of 20 a priori-selected taxa with nitrate-reducing capacity. Standardized scores of each taxon's relative abundance were summed, producing a nitrate-reducing taxa summary score (NO3TSS) for each participant. Natural log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, plasma glucose, systolic BP, and diastolic BP were regressed on NO3TSS in multivariable linear regressions; prediabetes mellitus and hypertension prevalence were regressed on NO3TSS using modified Poisson regression models. Nitrate-reducing bacterial species represented 20\u00b116% of all measured taxa. After multivariable adjustment, a 1-SD increase in NO3TSS, was associated with a -0.09 (95% CI, -0.15 to -0.03) and -1.03\u00a0mg/dL (95% CI, -1.903 to -0.16) lower natural log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and plasma glucose, respectively. NO3TSS was associated with systolic BP only among patients without hypertension; 1-SD increase in NO3TSS was associated with -1.53 (95% CI, -2.82 to -0.24) mm\u00a0Hg lower mean systolic BP. No associations were observed with prediabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Performing gradient agar diffusion with calcium enhancement of susceptibility testing media has been shown to improve the identification of polymyxin-resistant isolates with plasmid-mediated resistance (mcr-1). We therefore sought to evaluate the broad clinical applicability of this approach for colistin susceptibility testing by assessing a large and diverse collection of resistant and susceptible patient isolates collected from multiple U.S. medical centers. Among 217 isolates, the overall categorical and essential agreement for calcium-enhanced gradient agar diffusion were 73.7% and 65.5%, respectively, compared to the results for reference broth microdilution. Performance varied significantly by organism group, with agreement being highest for Enterobacterales and lowest for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Nevertheless, even for Enterobacterales, there was a high rate of very major errors (9.2%). Performance was similarly poor for calcium-enhanced broth microdilution. While calcium enhancement did allow for more accurate categorization of mcr-1-resistant isolates, there were unacceptably high rates of errors for both susceptible and non-mcr-1-resistant isolates, raising serious doubts about the suitability of these calcium-enhanced methods for routine colistin susceptibility testing in clinical laboratories.", "Keywords": ["Gram-negative bacteria", "antimicrobial resistance", "antimicrobial susceptibility testing", "colistin", "etest", "gradient agar diffusion", "multidrug resistance", "polymyxins"], "MeSH terms": ["Agar", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Calcium", "Colistin", "Culture Media", "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Enterobacteriaceae", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections", "Humans", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA dag2149@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Nenad", "Last Name": "Macesic", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mabel", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephania", "Last Name": "Stump", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Medical Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Whittier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey N", "Last Name": "Schuetz", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia J", "Last Name": "Simner", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Microbiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Romney M", "Last Name": "Humphries", "Affiliation": "Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, Arizona, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical microbiology", "PubDate": "2020Jan28"}, {"PMID": "31624266", "Title": "Colonizing multidrug-resistant bacteria and the longitudinal evolution of the intestinal microbiome after liver transplantation.", "Abstract": "Infections by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (LT).

These methods were a colistin broth disk elution (CBDE) and a colistin agar test (CAT), the latter of which was evaluated using two inoculum volumes, 1 \u03bcl (CAT-1) and 10 \u03bcl (CAT-10). The methods were evaluated using a collection of 270 isolates of Enterobacterales, 122 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and 106 Acinetobacter spp. isolates. Overall, 94.4% of CBDE results were in essential agreement and 97.9% in categorical agreement (CA) with reference broth microdilution MICs. Nine very major errors (VME; 3.2%) and 3 major errors (ME; 0.9%) were observed. With the CBDE, 98.6% CA was observed for Enterobacterales (2.5% VME, 0% ME), 99.3% CA was observed for P. aeruginosa (0% VME, 0.7% ME), and 93.1% CA was observed for Acinetobacter spp. (5.6% VME, 3.3% ME). Overall, CA was 94.9% with 6.8% VME using CAT-1 and improved to 98.3% with 3.9% VME using CAT-10. No ME were observed using either CAT-1 or CAT-10.

One such resistant pathogen is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is resistant to nearly all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, limiting treatment options. Here, we show that a significant proportion of MRSA isolates from different lineages, including the epidemic USA300 lineage, are susceptible to penicillins when used in combination with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid. Susceptibility is mediated by a combination of two different mutations in the mecA promoter region that lowers mecA-encoded penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) expression, and in the majority of isolates by either one of two substitutions in PBP2a (E246G or M122I) that increase the affinity of PBP2a for penicillin in the presence of clavulanic acid. Treatment of S. aureus infections in wax moth and mouse models shows that penicillin/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor susceptibility can be exploited as an effective therapeutic choice for 'susceptible' MRSA infection. Finally, we show that isolates with the PBP2a E246G substitution have a growth advantage in the presence of penicillin but the absence of clavulanic acid, which suggests that penicillin/\u03b2-lactamase susceptibility is an example of collateral sensitivity (resistance to one antibiotic increases sensitivity to another).

Bacterial transplantation from MDD patients to rodents produces depression-like behaviors. In humans, case-control studies have examined the gut microbiome in healthy and affected individuals. We systematically reviewed existing studies comparing gut microbial composition in MDD and healthy volunteers. Methods: A PubMed literature search combined the terms \"depression,\" \"depressive disorder,\" \"stool,\" \"fecal,\" \"gut,\" and \"microbiome\" to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between MDD and microbiota quantified from stool. We evaluated the resulting studies, focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between MDD and healthy controls. Results: Six eligible studies were found in which 50 taxa exhibited differences (p < 0.05) between patients with MDD and controls. Patient characteristics and methodologies varied widely between studies. Five phyla-Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Protobacteria-were represented; however, divergent results occurred across studies for all phyla. The largest number of differentiating taxa were within phylum Firmicutes, in which nine families and 12 genera differentiated the diagnostic groups. The majority of these families and genera were found to be statistically different between the two groups in two identified studies. Family Lachnospiraceae differentiated the diagnostic groups in four studies (with an even split in directionality). Across all five phyla, nine genera were higher in MDD (Anaerostipes, Blautia, Clostridium, Klebsiella, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus), six were lower (Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Escherichia/Shigella, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus), and six were divergent (Alistipes, Bacteroides, Megamonas, Oscillibacter, Prevotella, and Roseburia). We highlight mechanisms and products of bacterial metabolism as they may relate to the etiology of depression. Conclusions: No consensus has emerged from existing human studies of depression and gut microbiome concerning which bacterial taxa are most relevant to depression. This may in part be due to differences in study design. Given that bacterial functions are conserved across taxonomic groups, we propose that studying microbial functioning may be more productive than a purely taxonomic approach to understanding the gut microbiome in depression.", "Keywords": ["depression", "gut", "gut-brain axis", "microbiome", "microbiota"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie G", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Division of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ariel R", "Last Name": "Goldenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "J John", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "M Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Sublette", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30794538", "Title": "Mechanism and resistance for antimycobacterial activity of a fluoroquinophenoxazine compound.", "Abstract": "We have previously reported the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase I activity by a fluoroquinophenoxazine compound (FP-11g) with a 6-bipiperidinyl lipophilic side chain that exhibited promising antituberculosis activity (MIC = 2.5 \u03bcM against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SI = 9.8).

MRSA isolates from patients with CF that were collected over a 4-year period were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing, transcriptional analysis, and metabolic studies. Persistent MRSA infection was associated with staphylococcal metabolic adaptation, but not changes in immunogenicity. Adaptation was characterized by selective use of the tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle and generation of biofilm, a means of limiting oxidant stress. Increased transcription of specific metabolic genes was conserved in all host-adapted strains, most notably a 10,000-fold increase in fumC, which catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate and malate. Elevated fumarate levels promoted in vitro biofilm production in clinical isolates. Host-adapted strains preferred to assimilate glucose polymers and pyruvate, which can be metabolized to generate N-acetylglucosamine polymers that comprise biofilm. MRSA undergoes substantial metabolic adaptation to the human airway to cause chronic pulmonary infection, and selected metabolites may be useful therapeutically to inhibit infection.", "Keywords": ["bacterial metabolic adaptation", "chronic pulmonary infection", "cystic fibrosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylglucosamine", "Adult", "Animals", "Biofilms", "Bronchi", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Cytokines", "Female", "Fumarates", "Gentamicins", "Glucose", "Humans", "Lung Diseases", "Malates", "Male", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Middle Aged", "Phylogeny", "Pneumonia, Staphylococcal", "Pyruvic Acid", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Transcription, Genetic", "Tricarboxylic Acids", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stanislaw J", "Last Name": "Gabryszewski", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Wong Fok Lung", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Medini K", "Last Name": "Annavajhala", "Affiliation": "2Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kira L", "Last Name": "Tomlinson", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian A", "Last Name": "Riquelme", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Ibrahim N", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Loreani P", "Last Name": "Noguera", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Wickersham", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Arielle M", "Last Name": "Mulenos", "Affiliation": "4Department of Internal Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Peaper", "Affiliation": "5Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan L", "Last Name": "Koff", "Affiliation": "4Department of Internal Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "2Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatrics."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "30635416", "Title": "Sequential evolution of virulence and resistance during clonal spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.", "Abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed an alarming expansion of staphylococcal disease caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

Previously described virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes that promote the dissemination of CA-MRSA are carried by mobile genetic elements, including phages and plasmids. Here, we used high-resolution genomics and experimental infections to characterize the evolution of a USA300 variant plaguing a patient population at increased risk of infection to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of genetic elements that facilitate clonal spread of the pathogen. Genetic analyses provided conclusive evidence that fitness (manifest as emergence of a dominant clone) changed coincidently with the stepwise emergence of (i) a unique prophage and mutation of the regulator of the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic operon that promoted abscess formation and colonization, respectively, thereby priming the clone for success; and (ii) a unique plasmid that conferred resistance to two topical microbiocides, mupirocin and chlorhexidine, frequently used for decolonization and infection prevention. The resistance plasmid evolved through successive incorporation of DNA elements from non-S. aureus spp. into an indigenous cryptic plasmid, suggesting a mechanism for interspecies genetic exchange that promotes antimicrobial resistance.

While Klebsiella pneumoniae strains harboring blaKPC account for most CRE, recent evidence points to increasing diversification of CRE. We determined whether the CRE species and antibiotic resistance genotype influence the response to relebactam (REL), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor with class A/C activity, combined with imipenem-cilastatin (IMI). We carried out broth microdilution testing with IMI alone or in the presence of 4 \u03bcg/ml REL against 154 clinical isolates collected at a New York City hospital with a high prevalence of organisms carrying blaKPC, including Enterobacter spp. (n = 96), K. pneumoniae (n = 44), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Serratia marcescens (n = 9), and Citrobacter spp. (n = 4).

Addition of REL decreased the IMI MIC to the susceptible range (\u22641 \u03bcg/ml) against 88% of isolates. However, S. marcescens IMI-REL MICs were 4- to 8-fold higher than those for other organisms.

Here, we demonstrate that CREC has evolved as a highly antibiotic-resistant rather than highly virulent nosocomial pathogen. Applying genomics and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to a 7-year collection of CREC isolates from a northern Manhattan hospital system and to a large set of publicly available, geographically diverse genomes, we demonstrate clonal spread of a single clone, ST171. We estimate that two major clades of epidemic ST171 diverged prior to 1962, subsequently spreading in parallel from the Northeastern to the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States and demonstrating links to international sites. Acquisition of carbapenem and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants by both clades preceded widespread use of these drugs in the mid-1980s, suggesting that antibiotic pressure contributed substantially to its spread. Despite a unique mobile repertoire, ST171 isolates showed decreased virulence in vitro While a second clone, ST78, substantially contributed to the emergence of CREC, it encompasses diverse carbapenemase-harboring plasmids, including a potentially hypertransmissible IncN plasmid, also present in other sequence types. Rather than heightened virulence, CREC demonstrates lineage-specific, multifactorial adaptations to nosocomial environments coupled with a unique potential to acquire and disseminate carbapenem resistance genes. These findings indicate a need for robust surveillance efforts that are attentive to the potential for local and international spread of high-risk CREC clones.IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (CREC) has emerged as a formidable nosocomial pathogen. While sporadic acquisition of plasmid-encoded carbapenemases has been implicated as a major driver of CREC, ST171 and ST78 clones demonstrate epidemic potential. However, a lack of reliable genomic references and rigorous statistical analyses has left many gaps in knowledge regarding the phylogenetic context and evolutionary pathways of successful CREC. Our reconstruction of recent ST171 and ST78 evolution represents a significant addition to current understanding of CREC and the directionality of its spread from the Eastern United States to the northern Midwestern United States with links to international collections.

Four hundred sixteen mice were collected from predominantly residential buildings in seven sites across New York City over a period of 13\u00a0months. 16S rRNA sequencing identified Bacteroidetes as dominant and revealed high levels of Proteobacteria A targeted PCR screen of 11 bacteria, as indicated by 16S rRNA analyses, found that mice are carriers of several gastrointestinal disease-causing agents, including Shigella, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli Furthermore, genes mediating antimicrobial resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnrB) and \u03b2-lactam drugs (blaSHV and blaACT/MIR) were widely distributed.

To determine which factors, including selective antibiotic pressure, govern the expansion of two major lineages of CA-MRSA, namely \"USA300\" in Northern America and \"European ST80\" in North Africa, Europe and Middle-East, we explored virulence factor expression, and fitness levels with or without antibiotics. The sampled strains were collected in a temporal window representing various steps of the epidemics, reflecting predicted changes in effective population size as inferred from whole-genome analysis. In addition to slight variations in virulence factor expression and biofilm production that might influence the ecological niches of theses lineages, competitive fitness experiments revealed that the biological cost of resistance to methicillin, fusidic acid and fluoroquinolones is totally reversed in the presence of trace amount of antibiotics. Our results suggest that low-level antibiotics exposure in human and animal environments contributed to the expansion of both European ST80 and USA300 lineages in community settings.

Despite improved treatment outcomes compared to those achieved with aminoglycoside- and colistin-based regimens, the rapid evolution of CAZ-AVI resistance during treatment has previously been reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 258 (ST258) blaKPC-3-harboring isolates. Here, we report the stepwise evolution and isolation of two phenotypically distinct CAZ-AVI-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a patient with pancreatitis. All susceptible (n = 3) and resistant (n = 5) isolates were of the ST307 clonal background, a rapidly emerging clone. Taking advantage of short-read Illumina and long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing and full-length assembly of the core chromosome and plasmids, we demonstrate that CAZ-AVI resistance first occurred through a 532G \u2192 T blaKPC-2 point mutation in blaKPC-2 (D179Y protein substitution) following only 12 days of CAZ-AVI exposure. While subsequent isolates exhibited substantially decreased meropenem (MEM) MICs (\u22642 \u03bcg/ml), later cultures demonstrated a second CAZ-AVI resistance phenotype with a lower CAZ-AVI MIC (12 \u03bcg/ml) but also MEM resistance (MIC > 128 \u03bcg/ml). These CAZ-AVI- and MEM-resistant isolates showed evidence of multiple genomic adaptations, mainly through insertions and deletions. This included amplification and transposition of wild-type blaKPC-2 into a novel plasmid, an IS1 insertion upstream of ompK36, and disruption of the rfb gene locus in these isolates. Our findings illustrate the potential of CAZ-AVI resistance to emerge in non-K. pneumoniae ST258 clonal backgrounds and alternative blaKPC variants. These results raise concerns about the strong selective pressures incurred by novel carbapenemase inhibitors, such as avibactam, on isolates previously considered invulnerable to CAZ-AVI resistance.

The clinical effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), a weak inducer of AmpC beta-lactamases, is poorly understood. Here, we conducted a case-control study of adult inpatients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to Enterobacter, Serratia, or Citrobacter species from 2009 to 2015 to assess outcomes following treatment with TZP compared to FEP or meropenem (MEM). We collected clinical data and screened all isolates for the presence of ampC alleles by PCR. Primary study outcomes were 30-day mortality and persistent bacteremia at \u226572 h from the time of treatment initiation. Of 493 patients with bacteremia, 165 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 88 were treated with TZP and 77 with FEP or MEM. To minimize differences between covariates, we carried out propensity score matching, which yielded 41 matched pairs. Groups only differed by age, with patients in the TZP group significantly older (P = 0.012). There were no significant differences in 30-day mortality, persistent bacteremia, 7-day mortality, or treatment escalation between the two treatment groups, including in the propensity score-matched cohort.

We applied comparative whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to epidemiologically and geographically diverse ST398-MSSA, a pandemic lineage affecting both humans and livestock. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis predicted divergence of human-associated ST398-MSSA ~40\u00a0years ago. Isolates from Midwestern pigs and veterinarians differed substantially from those in New York City (NYC). Pig ST398 strains contained a large region of recombination representing imports from multiple sequence types (STs). Phylogeographic analyses supported the spread of ST398-MSSA along local cultural and migratory links between parts of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively. Applying pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that ST398 not only clustered in households but also frequently extended across local social networks. Isolates collected from environmental surfaces reflected the full diversity of colonizing individuals, highlighting their potentially critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Strikingly, we observed high within-host SNP variability compared to our previous studies on the dominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone USA300. Our data indicate that the dynamics of colonization, persistence, and transmission differ substantially between USA300-MRSA and ST398-MSSA. Taken together, our study reveals local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone, indicating key impacts of recombination and mutation on genetic diversification and highlighting important ecological differences from epidemic USA300.

the infection. Toxin secretion is central to the biology of many bacterial pathogens and is widely accepted as playing a crucial role in disease pathology. To understand the relationship between toxicity and bacterial virulence in greater depth, we studied two sequenced collections of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and found an unexpected inverse correlation between bacterial toxicity and disease severity. By applying a functional genomics approach, we identified several novel toxicity-affecting loci responsible for the wide range in toxic phenotypes observed within these collections. To understand the apparent higher propensity of low toxicity isolates to cause bacteraemia, we performed several functional assays, and our findings suggest that within-host fitness differences between high- and low-toxicity isolates in human serum is a contributing factor. As invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, limit the opportunities for onward transmission, highly toxic strains could gain an additional between-host fitness advantage, potentially contributing to the maintenance of toxicity at the population level. Our results clearly demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs between toxicity, relative fitness, and transmissibility are critical for understanding the multifaceted nature of bacterial virulence.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteremia", "Biofilms", "Biological Evolution", "Extracellular Traps", "Genomics", "Humans", "Peptide Hydrolases", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcus aureus", "alpha-Defensins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maisem", "Last Name": "Laabei", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Franklin D", "Last Name": "Lowy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Eloise D", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Maho", "Last Name": "Yokoyama", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Khadija", "Last Name": "Ouadi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Feil", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Harry A", "Last Name": "Thorpe", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Barnabas", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Perkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Sharon J", "Last Name": "Peacock", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Janina", "Last Name": "Dordel", "Affiliation": "Pathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Holden", "Affiliation": "Pathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom; School of Medicine, Medical & Biological Sciences, North Haugh, St Andrews, Fife, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Antonina A", "Last Name": "Votintseva", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Dept. of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Rory", "Last Name": "Bowden", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Derrick W", "Last Name": "Crook", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Dept. of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Bernadette C", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Dept. of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Dept. of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Recker", "Affiliation": "Centre for Mathematics and the Environment, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Ruth C", "Last Name": "Massey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "26136397", "Title": "Risk factors and outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in liver transplant recipients.", "Abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection is increasing in incidence and is associated with increased mortality in liver transplantation (LT) recipients.

Household reservoirs of these unique strains are crucial to their success as community-based pathogens. Staphylococci become resident in households, either as colonizers or environmental contaminants, increasing the risk for recurrent infections. Interactions of household members with others in different households or at community sites, including schools and daycare facilities, have a critical role in the ability of these strains to become endemic. Colonization density at these sites appears to have an important role in facilitating transmission. The integration of research tools, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), mathematical modeling, and social network analysis, has provided additional insight into the transmission dynamics of these strains. Thus far, interventions designed to reduce recurrent infections among household members have had limited success, likely due to the multiplicity of potential sources for recolonization.

Many S. aureus infections can be explained by host susceptibility or other predisposing risk factors. On the other hand, the emergence/re-emergence of successful S. aureus clones (referred to as epidemic waves) suggests a rapid bacterial adaption and evolution, which includes the emergence of antibiotic resistance and increased virulence and/or transmissibility. It is within this context that we review our understanding of selected S. aureus epidemic waves, and highlight the use of genome sequencing as a means to better understand the evolution of each lineage.", "Keywords": ["Antimicrobial resistance", "Epidemic", "Genome sequencing", "MRSA", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "MeSH terms": ["Community-Acquired Infections", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Phylogeny", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Virulence Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Otto", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franklin D", "Last Name": "Lowy", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank R", "Last Name": "DeLeo", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, USA.

In each U.S. Census region, reference laboratories collected successive MSSA isolates from patients with invasive or superficial staphylococcal infections for use in the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial. All isolates from the periods of 2004 to 2005 and 2009 to 2010 underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing and characterization of their staphylococcal protein A (spa) type. Of the 708 isolates analyzed, 274 spa types were identified and divided into 15 genetic clusters. The most common clones were spa t002 (n = 63, 8.9%) and t008 (n = 56, 7.9%). While the distribution of the predominant spa types did not differ by U.S. Census region or time period, spa t008 was nearly twice as common in community skin and soft tissue infections than in nosocomial bloodstream infections (11.1% versus 5.6%, respectively; P = 0.008). Despite such differences, both community and nosocomial settings had diverse staphylococcal clonal types representing all major spa clusters. In contrast to those of MRSA, MSSA infectious isolates show wide genetic diversity without clear geographical or temporal clustering. Notably, the prevalent MSSA strains (spa t002 and spa t008) are analogous to the predominant MRSA clones, further demonstrating the importance of both lineages.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cluster Analysis", "Community-Acquired Infections", "Cross Infection", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Molecular Typing", "Prevalence", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcal Protein A", "Staphylococcus aureus", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin A", "Last Name": "Miko", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. bm2266@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Cory A", "Last Name": "Hafer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caroline J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean B", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meredith A M", "Last Name": "Hackel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian M", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Whittier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phyllis", "Last Name": "Della-Latta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne-Catrin", "Last Name": "Uhlemann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Franklin D", "Last Name": "Lowy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical microbiology", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}]
