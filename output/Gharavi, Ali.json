[{"PMID": "38764005", "Title": "Assisting the analysis of insertions and deletions using regional allele frequencies.", "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of population allele frequency (AF) is crucial for gene discovery and genetic diagnostics. However, determining AF for frameshift-inducing small insertions and deletions (indels) faces challenges due to discrepancies in mapping and variant calling methods. Here, we propose an innovative approach to assess indel AF. We developed CRAFTS-indels (Calculating Regional Allele Frequency Targeting Small indels), an algorithm that combines AF of distinct indels within a given region and provides \"regional AF\" (rAF). We tested and validated CRAFTS-indels using three independent datasets: gnomAD v2 (n=125,748 samples), an internal dataset (IGM; n=39,367), and the UK BioBank (UKBB; n=469,835). By comparing rAF against standard AF, we identified rare indels with rAF exceeding standard AF (sAF\u226410-4 and rAF>10-4) as \"rAF-hi\" indels. Notably, a high percentage of rare indels were \"rAF-hi\", with a higher proportion in gnomAD v2 (11-20%) and IGM (11-22%) compared to the UKBB (5-9% depending on the CRAFTS-indels' parameters). Analysis of the overlap of regions based on their rAF with low complexity regions and with ClinVar classification supported the pertinence of rAF. Using the internal dataset, we illustrated the utility of CRAFTS-indel in the analysis of de novo variants and the potential negative impact of rAF-hi indels in gene discovery. In summary, annotation of indels with cohort specific rAF can be used to handle some of the limitations of current annotation pipelines and facilitate detection of novel gene disease associations. CRAFTS-indels offers a user-friendly approach to providing rAF annotation. It can be integrated into public databases such as gnomAD, UKBB and used by ClinVar to revise indel classifications.", "Keywords": ["Allele frequencies", "Bioinformatic pipeline", "Genomic mapping", "Insertions and deletions", "Variants annotation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "INDEL Mutation", "Gene Frequency", "Algorithms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarath Babu", "Last Name": "Krishna Murthy", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandy", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shiraz", "Last Name": "Bheda", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikita", "Last Name": "Tomar", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiyue", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amir", "Last Name": "Yaghoobi", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atlas", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua E", "Last Name": "Motelow", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hila", "Last Name": "Milo Rasouly", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Genetics and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Prospectively identifying monogenic conditions associated with post-transplant complications may enable personalized management. Therefore, we developed a transplant morbidity panel (355 genes) associated with major post-transplant complications including cardiometabolic disorders, immunodeficiency, malignancy, and thrombophilia. This gene panel was then evaluated using exome sequencing data from 1590 KTR. Additionally, genes associated with monogenic kidney and genitourinary disorders along with American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) secondary findings v3.2 were annotated. Altogether, diagnostic variants in 37 genes associated with Mendelian kidney and genitourinary disorders were detected in 9.9% (158/1590) of KTR; 25.9% (41/158) had not been clinically diagnosed. Moreover, the transplant morbidity gene panel detected diagnostic variants for 56 monogenic disorders in 9.1% KTRs (144/1590). Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, immunodeficiency, and thrombophilia variants were detected in 5.1% (81), 2.1% (34), 1.8% (29) and 0.2% (3) among 1590 KTRs, respectively. Concordant phenotypes were present in half of these cases. Reviewing implications for transplant care, these genetic findings would have allowed physicians to set specific risk factor targets in 6.3% (9/144), arrange intensive surveillance in 97.2% (140/144), utilize preventive measures in 13.2% (19/144), guide disease-specific therapy in 63.9% (92/144), initiate specialty referral in 90.3% (130/144) and alter immunosuppression in 56.9% (82/144).

Understanding CG pathogenesis represents a key step for the development of targeted therapies. Previous work implicated the telomerase protein component TERT in CG pathogenesis, as transgenic TERT expression in adult mice resulted in a CG resembling that seen in human primary CG and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Here, we used the telomerase-induced mouse model of CG (i-TERTci mice) to identify mechanisms to inhibit CG pathogenesis. Inactivation of WIP1 phosphatase, a p53 target acting in a negative feedback loop, blocked disease initiation in i-TERTci mice. Repression of disease initiation upon WIP1 deficiency was associated with senescence enhancement and required transforming growth factor-\u03b2 functions. The efficacy of a pharmacologic treatment to reduce disease severity in both i-TERTci mice and in a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26 mice) was then assessed. Pharmacologic inhibition of WIP1 enzymatic activity in either the telomerase mice with CG or in the Tg26 mice promoted partial remission of proteinuria and ameliorated kidney histopathologic features. Histological as well as high-throughput sequencing methods further showed that selective inhibition of WIP1 does not promote kidney fibrosis or inflammation.

Sequencing results had many implications for clinical management, including familial testing for early diagnosis and management, preventative screening for associated comorbidities, and in some cases for therapy. Exome sequencing provided a 5.7% diagnostic rate in CLD patients and required multiple rounds of review to reduce both false positive and false negative findings.

We defined 30 genome-wide significant risk loci explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were new, including TNFSF4/TNFSF18, REL, CD28, PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/TNFSF15, REEP3, ZMIZ1, OVOL1/RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The risk loci were enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed a positive genetic correlation between IgAN and serum IgA levels. High polygenic score for IgAN was associated with earlier onset of kidney failure. In a comprehensive functional annotation analysis of candidate causal genes, we observed convergence of biological candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Immunoglobulin A"],

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

is a prevalent human developmental defect with highly heterogeneous clinical presentations and outcomes. Genetics may refine diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, but the genomic architecture of COU is largely unknown. Comprehensive genomic screening study of 733 cases with three distinct COU subphenotypes revealed disease etiology in 10.0% of them. We detected no significant differences in the overall diagnostic yield among COU subphenotypes, with characteristic variable expressivity of several mutant genes. Our findings therefore may legitimize a genetic first diagnostic approach for COU, especially when burdening clinical and imaging characterization is not complete or available.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

"Abstract": "Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic pain disorder causing symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and bladder discomfort or pain. Although this condition affects a large population, little is known about its etiology. Genetic analyses of whole exome sequencing are performed on 109 individuals with IC/BPS. One family has a previously reported\u00a0SIX5\u00a0variant (ENST00000317578.6:c.472G>A, p.Ala158Thr), consistent with Branchiootorenal syndrome 2 (BOR2). A likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in\u00a0ATP2A2\u00a0(ENST00000539276.2:c.235G>A, p.Glu79Lys) is identified in two unrelated probands, indicating possible Darier-White disease. Two private heterozygous variants are identified in\u00a0ATP2C1\u00a0(ENST00000393221.4:c.2358A>T, p.Glu786Asp (VUS/Likely Pathogenic) and ENST00000393221.4:c.989C>G, p.Thr330Ser (likely pathogenic)), indicative of Hailey-Hailey Disease. Sequence kernel association test analysis finds an increased burden of rare\u00a0ATP2C1\u00a0variants in the IC/BPS cases versus a control cohort (p = 0.03, OR = 6.76), though does not survive Bonferroni correction. The data suggest that some individuals with IC/BPS may have unrecognized Mendelian syndromes. Comprehensive phenotyping and genotyping aid in understanding the range of diagnoses in the population-based IC/BPS cohort. Conversely,\u00a0ATP2C1, ATP2A2,\u00a0and\u00a0SIX5\u00a0may be candidate genes for IC/BPS. Further evaluation with larger numbers is needed.

We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries.

adults with chronic kidney disease has a monogenic form of disease. However, genetic services in adult nephrology are limited. An adult Kidney Genetics Clinic was established within the nephrology division at a large urban academic medical center to increase access to genetic services and testing in adults with kidney disease. Between June 2019 and December 2021, a total of 363 patients were referred to the adult Kidney Genetics Clinic. Of those who completed genetic testing, a positive diagnostic finding was identified in 27.1%, a candidate diagnostic finding was identified in 6.7% of patients, and a nondiagnostic positive finding was identified in an additional 8.6% of patients, resulting in an overall yield of 42.4% for clinically relevant genetic findings in tested patients. A genetic diagnosis had implications for medical management, family member testing, and eligibility for clinical trials. With the utilization of telemedicine, genetic services reached a diverse geographic and patient population. Genetic education efforts were integral to the clinic's success, as they increased visibility and helped providers identify appropriate referrals.

research participants share genomic screening results with family members?", "Abstract": "The public health impact of genomic screening can be enhanced by cascade testing. However, cascade testing depends on communication of results to family members. While the barriers and facilitators of family communication have been researched following clinical genetic testing, the factors impacting the dissemination of genomic screening results are unknown. Using the pragmatic Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network-3 (eMERGE-3) study, we explored the reported sharing practices of participants who underwent genomic screening across the United States. Six eMERGE-3 sites returned genomic screening results for mostly dominant medically actionable disorders and surveyed adult participants regarding communication of results with first-degree relatives. Across the sites, 279 participants completed a 1-month and/or 6-month post-results survey. By 6\u00a0months, only 34% of the 156 respondents shared their results with all first-degree relatives and 4% did not share with any. Over a third (39%) first-degree relatives were not notified of the results. Half (53%) of participants who received their results from a genetics provider shared them with all first-degree relatives compared with 11% of participants who received their results from a non-genetics provider. The most frequent reasons for sharing were a feeling of obligation (72%) and that the information could help family members make medical decisions (72%). The most common reasons indicated for not sharing were that the family members were too young (38%), or they were not in contact (25%) or not close to them (25%). These data indicate that the professional returning the results may impact sharing patterns, suggesting that there is a need to continue to educate healthcare providers regarding approaches to facilitate sharing of genetic results within families. Finally, these data suggest that interventions to increase sharing may be universally effective regardless of the origin of the genetic result.", "Keywords": ["cascade testing", "communication",

Furthermore, existing phenotyping algorithms are not uniformly applied across large datasets and can suffer from inconsistencies in case definitions across different algorithms. We describe here quantitative disease risk scores based on almost unsupervised methods that require minimal input from clinicians, can be applied to large datasets, and alleviate some of the main weaknesses of existing phenotyping algorithms. We show applications to phenotypic data on approximately 100,000 individuals in eMERGE, and focus on several complex diseases, including Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Failure, and a few others. We demonstrate that relative to existing approaches, the proposed methods have higher prediction accuracy, can better identify phenotypic features relevant to the disease under consideration, can perform better at clinical risk stratification, and can identify undiagnosed cases based on phenotypic features available in the EHR. Using genetic data from the eMERGE-seq panel that includes sequencing data for 109 genes on 21,363 individuals from multiple ethnicities, we also show how the new quantitative disease risk scores help improve the power of genetic association studies relative to the standard use of disease phenotypes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantitative disease risk scores derived from rich phenotypic EHR databases to provide a more meaningful characterization of clinical risk for diseases of interest beyond the prevalent binary (case-control) classification.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danqing", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atlas", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zihuai", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iftikhar J", "Last Name": "Kullo", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shawn", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yizhao", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Qi", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iuliana", "Last Name": "Ionita-Laza", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ii2135@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "NPJ digital medicine", "PubDate": "2021Jul23"}, {"PMID": "34156980", "Title": "Association of rare predicted loss-of-function variants of influenza-related type I IFN genes with critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone.

remains unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results.

Monogenic forms of pediatric SRNS are predominantly caused by recessive mutations, while the contribution of de novo variants (DNVs) to this trait is poorly understood. Using exome sequencing (ES) in a proband with FSGS/SRNS, developmental delay, and epilepsy, we discovered a nonsense DNV in TRIM8, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 8. To establish whether TRIM8 variants represent a cause of FSGS, we aggregated exome/genome-sequencing data for 2,501 pediatric FSGS/SRNS-affected individuals and 48,556 control subjects, detecting eight heterozygous TRIM8 truncating variants in affected subjects but none in control subjects (p = 3.28\u00a0\u00d7 10-11). In all six cases with available parental DNA, we demonstrated de novo inheritance (p\u00a0=\u00a02.21\u00a0\u00d7 10-15). Reverse phenotyping revealed neurodevelopmental disease in all eight families. We next analyzed ES from 9,067 individuals with epilepsy, yielding three additional families with truncating TRIM8 variants. Clinical review revealed FSGS in all. All TRIM8 variants cause protein truncation clustering within the last exon between residues 390 and 487 of the 551 amino acid protein, indicating a correlation between this syndrome and loss of the TRIM8 C-terminal region. Wild-type TRIM8 overexpressed in immortalized human podocytes and neuronal cells localized to nuclear bodies, while constructs harboring patient-specific variants mislocalized diffusely to the nucleoplasm. Co-localization studies demonstrated that Gemini and Cajal bodies frequently abut a TRIM8 nuclear body. Truncating TRIM8 DNVs cause a neuro-renal syndrome via aberrant TRIM8 localization, implicating nuclear bodies in FSGS and developmental brain disease.", "Keywords": ["FSGS", "SRNS", "TRIM8", "epilepsy", "genomics", "monogenic", "nuclear body"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Line", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Codon, Nonsense", "Developmental Disabilities", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental", "Humans", "Intranuclear Space", "Kidney", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nephrotic Syndrome", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Phenotype", "Podocytes", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia L", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amar J", "Last Name": "Majmundar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kamal", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Center for Disease Modeling, Duke University, Durham, NC 27701, USA; Advanced Center for Translational and Genetic Medicine (ACT-GeM), Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, Ann & Robert H.

broader introduction of genomic medicine in research and clinical care, an increasing number of persons are offered genetic testing. Many factors, including genetic literacy, may impact the utilization of genetic results by patients and their families. We developed a rapid, self-administered measure of genetic literacy, called Genetic Literacy Fast Test (GeneLiFT). We next evaluated the association of GeneLiFT scores with the comprehension of limitations of genomic medicine in participants undergoing genetic testing in the NIH-sponsored eMERGE III study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York. All participants underwent genetic screening for variants in 74 actionable genes associated with adult-onset disorders. A diverse cohort of 724 participants completed the survey (60% women, 45% less than 40\u00a0years old, and 53% self-reported White non-Hispanic ancestry). The GeneLiFT was validated using known group differences based on education, health literacy, and numeracy, and with questions assessing genetic knowledge. GeneLiFT identified multiple standard genetics terms, that is, jargon, not recognized by more than 50% of participants (including actionability and pathogenicity). Low genetic literacy, identified in 210 participants (29%), was significantly associated with poor understanding of the limitations of genetic testing (p-values\u00a0<\u00a010-9 ). This association was independent of education, health literacy, and numeracy levels, highlighting the importance of directly measuring genetic literacy. Low genetic literacy was also associated with low satisfaction with the informed consent process. GeneLiFT is a practical tool for rapid assessment of genetic literacy in large studies or clinical care. GeneLiFT will allow future research to efficiently assess the role of genetic literacy on the clinical impact of genetic testing.", "Keywords": ["assessment", "communication", "genetic knowledge", "genetic literacy", "risk perception", "screening", "test"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hila", "Last Name": "Milo Rasouly", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cuneo", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maddalena", "Last Name": "Marasa", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "DeMaria", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debanjana", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline J", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fasel", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Medicine and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of genetic counseling", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33276377", "Title": "Heterozygous loss of WBP11 function causes multiple congenital defects in humans and mice.", "Abstract": "The genetic causes of multiple congenital anomalies are incompletely understood.

WBP11 encodes a component of the spliceosome with the ability to activate pre-messenger RNA splicing. We generated a Wbp11 null allele in mouse using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. Wbp11 homozygous null embryos die prior to E8.5, indicating that Wbp11 is essential for development. Fewer Wbp11 heterozygous null mice are found than expected due to embryonic and postnatal death. Importantly, Wbp11 heterozygous null mice are small and exhibit defects in axial skeleton, kidneys and esophagus, similar to the affected individuals, supporting the role of WBP11 haploinsufficiency in the development of congenital malformations in humans.

Corepressor ZMYM2 Cause Syndromic Urinary Tract Malformations.", "Abstract": "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) constitute one of the most frequent birth defects and represent the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in the first three decades of life. Despite the discovery of dozens of monogenic causes of CAKUT, most pathogenic pathways remain elusive. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 551 individuals with CAKUT and identified a heterozygous de novo stop-gain variant in ZMYM2 in two different families with CAKUT. Through collaboration, we identified in total 14 different heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ZMYM2 in 15 unrelated families. Most mutations occurred de novo, indicating possible interference with reproductive function. Human disease features are replicated in X.\u00a0tropicalis larvae with morpholino knockdowns, in which expression of truncated ZMYM2 proteins, based on individual mutations, failed to rescue renal and craniofacial defects. Moreover, heterozygous Zmym2-deficient mice recapitulated features of CAKUT with high penetrance. The ZMYM2 protein is a component of a transcriptional corepressor complex recently linked to the silencing of developmentally regulated endogenous retrovirus elements. Using protein-protein interaction assays, we show that ZMYM2 interacts with additional epigenetic silencing complexes, as well as confirming that it binds to FOXP1, a transcription factor that has also been linked to CAKUT. In summary, our findings establish that loss-of-function mutations of ZMYM2, and potentially that of other proteins in its interactome, as causes of human CAKUT, offering new routes for studying the pathogenesis of the disorder.", "Keywords": ["FIM", "ZMYM2", "ZNF198", "congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract", "extra-renal features", "genetic kidney disease", "genomic analysis", "syndromic CAKUT", "transcription regulator", "whole-exome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Amphibian Proteins", "Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Family", "Female", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Infant", "Larva", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Morpholinos", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Protein Binding", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Urinary Tract", "Urogenital Abnormalities", "Exome Sequencing", "Xenopus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dervla M", "Last Name": "Connaughton", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital - London Health Sciences Centre, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, 339 Windermere Road, London, ON N6A 5A5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rufeng", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, 201102 Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Danielle J", "Last Name": "Owen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Marquez", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Genomics Discovery Program, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adda L", "Last Name": "Graham-Paquin", "Affiliation": "Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre and Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC H3A 1A3, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Makiko", "Last Name": "Nakayama", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Etienne", "Last Name": "Coyaud", "Affiliation": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network & Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; Univ.

Rare inherited forms of CKD frequently span diverse phenotypes, reflecting genetic phenomena including pleiotropy, incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Use of chromosomal microarray and massively parallel sequencing technologies has revealed that genomic disorders and monogenic aetiologies contribute meaningfully to seemingly complex forms of CKD across different clinically defined subgroups and are characterized by high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Investigations of prevalent genomic disorders in CKD have integrated genetic, bioinformatic and functional studies to pinpoint the genetic drivers underlying their renal and extra-renal manifestations, revealing both monogenic and polygenic mechanisms. Similarly, massively parallel sequencing-based analyses have identified gene- and allele-level variation that contribute to the clinically diverse phenotypes observed for many monogenic forms of nephropathy. Genome-wide sequencing studies suggest that dual genetic diagnoses are found in at least 5% of patients in whom a genetic cause of disease is identified, highlighting the fact that complex phenotypes can also arise from multilocus variation. A multifaceted approach that incorporates genetic and phenotypic data from large, diverse cohorts will help to elucidate the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for different forms of CKD, supporting personalized medicine for individuals with kidney disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosome Mapping", "Genotype", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Precision Medicine", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Urologic Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily E", "Last Name": "Groopman", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gundula", "Last Name": "Povysil", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. ag2239@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

in Internal Medicine.", "Abstract": "Medicine has long sought to match diagnostic and treatment approaches to the particular needs and risks of individual patients. The decreasing cost and increasing ease of genetic sequencing have propelled the rise of precision medicine. Precision medicine aims to use genetic and other information to provide care tailored to the individual patient, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and minimizing unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Although developments in genetic sequencing have the potential to transform clinical care, there are important limitations, including uncertainty in the clinical interpretation of many genetic variants and concerns about privacy, discrimination, and cost. To help clinicians understand the basics of genetic sequencing and how to apply it in clinical practice, Annals of Internal Medicine is launching a new \"Precision Medicine\" series. This introduction provides a general overview of clinical sequencing, with a focus on germline variation. Subsequent articles will use a case-based format to provide concise summaries of specific clinical precision medicine scenarios that are relevant to the practice of internal medicine. These cases will highlight specific clinical indications; interpretation of genetic test results; and ethical, legal, cost, and privacy issues related to genetic testing. The goal is to provide practical information on the appropriate application and interpretation of genomics in routine clinical practice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Databases, Nucleic Acid", "Genetic Carrier Screening", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Privacy", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Incidental Findings", "Insurance Coverage", "Insurance, Health", "Internal Medicine", "Precision Medicine", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Uncertainty"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Rowe", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York (J.W.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York (K.K., D.B.G., A.G.G., R.W., W.K.C.)."}], "Journal": "Annals of internal medicine", "PubDate": "2019May07"}, {"PMID": "30930462", "Title": "Evaluation of the cost and effectiveness of diverse recruitment methods for a genetic screening study.", "Abstract": "Recruitment of participants from diverse backgrounds is crucial to the generalizability of genetic research, but has proven challenging.

The Cure Glomerulonephropathy study (CureGN) is an international longitudinal cohort study of children and adults with four primary glomerular diseases (minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and IgA nephropathy). HRQOL is systematically assessed using items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informative System (PROMIS). We assessed the relationship between HRQOL and demographic and clinical variables in 478 children and 1115 adults at the time of enrollment into CureGN. Domains measured by PROMIS items included global assessments of health, mobility, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep impairment, as well as a derived composite measure incorporating all measured domains. Multivariable models were created that explained 7 to 32% of variance in HRQOL. Patient-reported edema consistently had the strongest and most robust association with each measured domain of HRQOL in multivariable analysis (adjusted \u03b2 [95% CI] for composite PROMIS score in children, -5.2 [-7.1 to -3.4]; for composite PROMIS score in adults, -6.1 [-7.4 to -4.9]). Female sex, weight (particularly obesity), and estimated glomerular filtration rate were also associated with some, but not all, domains of HRQOL. Primary diagnosis, disease duration, and exposure to immunosuppression were not associated with HRQOL after adjustment. Sensitivity analyses and interaction testing demonstrated no significant association between disease duration or immunosuppression and any measured domain of HRQOL. Thus, patient-reported edema has a consistent negative association with HRQOL in patients with primary glomerular diseases, with substantially greater impact than other demographic and clinical variables.", "Keywords": ["edema", "health-related quality of life", "patient-reported outcomes", "primary glomerular disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Edema", "Female", "Glomerulonephritis", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Self Report"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pietro A", "Last Name": "Canetta", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.

We assemble genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function that defines CKD, in 312,468 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identify 127 distinct association signals with homogeneous effects on eGFR across ancestries and enrichment in genomic annotations including kidney-specific histone modifications. Fine-mapping reveals 40 high-confidence variants driving eGFR associations and highlights putative causal genes with cell-type specific expression in glomerulus, and in\u00a0proximal and distal nephron. Mendelian randomisation supports causal effects of eGFR on overall and cause-specific CKD, kidney stone formation, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. These results define novel molecular mechanisms and putative causal genes for eGFR, offering insight into clinical outcomes and routes to CKD treatment development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Histone Code", "Histones", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Kidney", "Kidney Calculi", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew P", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3GL, UK. apmorris@liverpool.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Thu H", "Last Name": "Le", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haojia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Artur", "Last Name": "Akbarov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Biology and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "van der Most", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, P.O.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,824 cases and 21,498 controls. Affected individuals carried a significant burden of rare exonic (that is, affecting coding regions) CNVs and were enriched for known genomic disorders (GD). Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs. Deletions at 17q12, 4p16.1-p16.3 and 22q11.2 were specific for KA; the 16p11.2 locus showed extensive pleiotropy. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified TBX6 as a driver for the CAKUT subphenotypes in the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosome Deletion", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Kidney", "Male", "Urinary Tract", "Urogenital Abnormalities", "Vesico-Ureteral Reflux"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Verbitsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rik", "Last Name": "Westland", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandra", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qingxue", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priya", "Last Name": "Krithivasan", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adele", "Last Name": "Mitrotti", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fasel", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ekaterina", "Last Name": "Batourina", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew G", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "University of Michigan School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics-Nephrology, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Bodria", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation, and Laboratory on Pathophysiology of Uremia, Istituto G.

medical centers with electronic medical records linked to existing biorepository samples for genomic discovery and genomic medicine research. The network sought to unify the genetic results from 78 Illumina and Affymetrix genotype array batches from 12 contributing medical centers for joint association analysis of 83,717 human participants. In this report, we describe the imputation of eMERGE results and methods to create the unified imputed merged set of genome-wide variant genotype data. We imputed the data using the Michigan Imputation Server, which provides a missing single-nucleotide variant genotype imputation service using the minimac3 imputation algorithm with the Haplotype Reference Consortium genotype reference set. We describe the quality control and filtering steps used in the generation of this data set and suggest generalizable quality thresholds for imputation and phenotype association studies. To test the merged imputed genotype set, we replicated a previously reported chromosome 6 HLA-B herpes zoster (shingles) association and discovered a novel zoster-associated loci in an epigenetic binding site near the terminus of chromosome 3 (3p29).", "Keywords": ["GWAS", "electronic medical records", "genotypes", "herpes zoster", "variants"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Black People",

As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10-16), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.", "Keywords": ["biomedical informatics", "diagnosis", "electronic health records", "exome", "genome", "knowledge engineering", "natural language processing", "next-generation sequencing", "phenotyping", "precision medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Electronic Health Records", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Genomics", "Genotype", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Phenotype", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Retrospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jung Hoon", "Last Name": "Son", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gangcai", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Raymond G.

Serum response factor (SRF) is a master transcription factor for the actin cytoskeleton, but the in vivo expression and function of SRF in podocytes are unknown. We found that SRF protein colocalizes with podocyte markers in human and mouse kidneys. Compared with littermate controls, mice in which the Srf gene was conditionally inactivated with NPHS2-Cre exhibited early postnatal proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and azotemia. Histologic changes in the mutant mice included glomerular capillary dilation and mild glomerulosclerosis, with reduced expression of multiple canonical podocyte markers. We also noted tubular dilation, cell proliferation, and protein casts as well as reactive changes in mesangial cells and interstitial inflammation. Ultrastructure analysis disclosed foot process effacement with loss of slit diaphragms. To ascertain the importance of SRF cofactors in podocyte function, we disabled the myocardin-related transcription factor A and B genes. Although loss of either SRF cofactor alone had no observable effect in the kidney, deficiency of both recapitulated the Srf-null phenotype.

We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0\u00a0\u00d7 10-5 for novel LOF, increased to p = 4.1\u00a0\u00d7 10-6 for LOF and deleterious missense variants combined, and augmented further after accounting for segregation and de novo inheritance of rare variants (joint p = 2.3\u00a0\u00d7 10-7). Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 disruption or knockdown of greb1l in zebrafish caused specific pronephric defects, which were rescued by wild-type human GREB1L mRNA, but not mRNA containing alleles identified in case subjects.

However, for most patients with CAKUT, the causative mutation remains unknown. We identified a kindred with an autosomal dominant form of CAKUT. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a heterozygous truncating mutation (c.279delG, p.Trp93fs*) of the nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 gene (NRIP1) in all seven affected members. NRIP1 encodes a nuclear receptor transcriptional cofactor that directly interacts with the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to modulate retinoic acid transcriptional activity. Unlike wild-type NRIP1, the altered NRIP1 protein did not translocate to the nucleus, did not interact with RAR\u03b1, and failed to inhibit retinoic acid-dependent transcriptional activity upon expression in HEK293 cells. Notably, we also showed that treatment with retinoic acid enhanced NRIP1 binding to RAR\u03b1 RNA in situ hybridization confirmed Nrip1 expression in the developing urogenital system of the mouse. In explant cultures of embryonic kidney rudiments, retinoic acid stimulated Nrip1 expression, whereas a pan-RAR antagonist strongly reduced it. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a null allele of Nrip1 showed a CAKUT-spectrum phenotype. Finally, expression and knockdown experiments in Xenopus laevis confirmed an evolutionarily conserved role for NRIP1 in renal development. These data indicate that dominant NRIP1 mutations can cause CAKUT by interference with retinoic acid transcriptional signaling, shedding light on the well documented association between abnormal vitamin A levels and renal malformations in humans, and suggest a possible gene-environment pathomechanism in this disease.", "Keywords": ["CAKUT", "NRIP1", "retinoic acid"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin", "Urinary Tract"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Asaf", "Last Name": "Vivante", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Hagith", "Last Name": "Yonath", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine A and Genetics Institute, Sheba Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Anna-Carina", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Maike", "Last Name": "Getwan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Renal Division, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Kaminski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Renal Division, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Bohnenpoll", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Teyssier", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche en Canc\u00e9rologie de Montpellier (IRCM), Montpellier, France;

These genes encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1 that encodes the key enzyme responsible for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1 determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells.

IgG autoantibodies against galactose-deficient IgA1 in patients with IgA nephropathy have a specific amino-acid sequence, Y1CS3, in the complementarity-determining region 3 of the heavy chain variable region compared with a Y1CA3 sequence in similar isotype-matched IgG from healthy controls. We previously found that the S3 residue is critical for binding galactose-deficient IgA1. To determine whether this difference is due to a rare germline sequence, we amplified and sequenced the corresponding germline variable region genes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seven patients with IgA nephropathy and six healthy controls from whom we had cloned single-cell lines secreting monoclonal IgG specific for galactose-deficient IgA1. Sanger DNA sequencing revealed that complementarity-determining region 3 in the variable region of the germline genes encoded the Y1C(A/V)3 amino-acid sequence. Thus, the A/V>S substitution in the complementarity-determining region 3 of anti-galactose-deficient-IgA1 autoantibodies of the patients with IgA nephropathy is not a rare germline gene variant. Modeling analyses indicated that the S3 hydroxyl group spans the complementarity-determining region 3 loop stem, stabilizing the adjacent \u03b2-sheet and stem structure, important features for effective binding to galactose-deficient IgA1.

A major susceptibility locus, HIVAN1, was previously mapped to chromosome 3A1-A3 in a cross between TgFVB and CAST/EiJ (CAST) strains, and introgression of a 51.9 Mb segment encompassing HIVAN1 from CAST into TgFVB resulted in accelerated development of nephropathy. We generated three sub-congenic strains carrying CAST alleles in the proximal or distal regions of the HIVAN1 locus (Sub-II, 3.02-38.93 Mb; Sub-III, 38.45-55.1 Mb and Sub-IV, 47.7-55.1 Mb, build 38). At 5-10 weeks of age, histologic injury and proteinuria did not differ between HIV-1 transgenic Sub-II and TgFVB mice. In contrast, HIV-1 transgenic Sub-III and Sub-IV mice displayed up to 4.4 fold more histopathologic injury and 6-fold more albuminuria compared to TgFVB mice, similar in severity to the full-length congenic mice. The Sub-IV segment defines a maximal 7.4 Mb interval for HIVAN1, and encodes 31 protein coding genes: 15 genes have missense variants differentiating CAST from FVB, and 14 genes show differential renal expression. Of these, Frem1, Foxo1, and Setd7 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nephropathy. HIVAN1 congenic kidneys are histologically normal without the HIV-1 transgene, yet their global transcriptome is enriched for molecular signatures of apoptosis, adenoviral infection, as well as genes repressed by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, a histone modification associated with HIV-1 life cycle.

Five novel candidate genes for CAKUT were identified that showed specific expression in the human and mouse developing urinary tract.

TBX18 is essential for developmental specification of the ureteric mesenchyme and ureteric smooth muscle cells. We found that all three TBX18 altered proteins still dimerized with the wild-type protein but had prolonged protein half life and exhibited reduced transcriptional repression activity compared to wild-type TBX18. The p.Lys163Glu substitution altered an amino acid residue critical for TBX18-DNA interaction, resulting in impaired TBX18-DNA binding.

Of three complement-activation pathways, the alternative and lectin pathways are involved in IgA nephropathy. IgA1 can activate both pathways in vitro, and pathway components are present in the mesangial immunodeposits, including properdin and factor H in the alternative pathway and mannan-binding lectin, mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases 1 and 2, and C4d in the lectin pathway. Genome-wide association studies identified deletion of complement factor H-related genes 1 and 3 as protective against the disease. Because the corresponding gene products compete with factor H in the regulation of the alternative pathway, it has been hypothesized that the absence of these genes could lead to more potent inhibition of complement by factor H. Complement activation can take place directly on IgA1-containing immune complexes in circulation and/or after their deposition in the mesangium. Notably, complement factors and their fragments may serve as biomarkers of IgA nephropathy in serum, urine, or renal tissue.

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for \u223c2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipogenesis", "Adiposity", "Age Factors", "Body Mass Index", "Energy

fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipocytes", "Adipogenesis", "Adipose Tissue", "Age Factors", "Body Fat Distribution", "Body Mass Index", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Europe", "Female",

We identified six new genome-wide significant associations, four in ITGAM-ITGAX, VAV3 and CARD9 and two new independent signals at HLA-DQB1 and DEFA. We replicated the nine previously reported signals, including known SNPs in the HLA-DQB1 and DEFA loci. The cumulative burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with age at disease onset. Most loci are either directly associated with risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier and response to mucosal pathogens. The geospatial distribution of risk alleles is highly suggestive of multi-locus adaptation, and genetic risk correlates strongly with variation in local pathogens, particularly helminth diversity, suggesting a possible role for host-intestinal pathogen interactions in shaping the genetic landscape of IgAN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins", "CD11b Antigen", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Pleiotropy", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA", "HLA-D Antigens", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immunity", "Intestines", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yifu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Scolari", "Affiliation": "1] Division of Nephrology, Azienda Ospedaliera Spedali Civili of Brescia, Montichiari Hospital, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.

Our recent genome-wide association study of IgAN identified susceptibility loci on 1q32 containing the complement regulatory protein-encoding genes CFH and CFHR1-5, with rs6677604 in CFH as the top single-nucleotide polymorphism and CFHR3-1 deletion (CFHR3-1\u2206) as the top signal for copy number variation. In this study, to explore the clinical effects of variation in CFH, CFHR3, and CFHR1 on IgAN susceptibility and progression, we enrolled two populations. Group 1 included 1178 subjects with IgAN and available genome-wide association study data. Group 2 included 365 subjects with IgAN and available clinical follow-up data. In group 1, rs6677604 was associated with mesangial C3 deposition by genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. In group 2, we detected a linkage between the rs6677604-A allele and CFHR3-1\u2206 and found that the rs6677604-A allele was associated with higher serum levels of CFH and lower levels of the complement activation split product C3a. Furthermore, CFH levels were positively associated with circulating C3 levels and negatively associated with mesangial C3 deposition. Moreover, serum levels of the pathogenic galactose-deficient glycoform of IgA1 were also associated with the degree of mesangial C3 deposition in patients with IgAN. Our findings suggest that genetic variants in CFH, CFHR3, and CFHR1 affect complement activation and thereby, predispose patients to develop IgAN.", "Keywords": ["IgA nephropathy", "complement activation", "complement factor H", "complement factor H receptor 3-1\u0394 deletion"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Blood Proteins", "Case-Control Studies", "Complement Activation", "Complement C3a", "Complement C3b Inactivator Proteins", "Complement Factor H", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Glomerular Mesangium", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin A", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China;

The discovery of this novel mechanism has potential implications for the treatment of infants with aHUS, who are increasingly treated with complement blocking agents. In this study, we used homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to identify a novel truncating mutation in DGKE (p.K101X) in a consanguineous family with patients affected by thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by significant serum complement activation and consumption of the complement fraction C3. Aggressive plasma infusion therapy controlled systemic symptoms and prevented renal failure, suggesting that this treatment can significantly affect the natural history of this aggressive disease.

These immunodeposits originate from circulating immune complexes consisting of anti-glycan antibodies bound to Gd-IgA1. As clinical disease onset and activity of IgAN often coincide with mucosal infections and dysregulation of cytokines, we hypothesized that cytokines may affect IgA1 O-glycosylation. We used IgA1-secreting cells derived from the circulation of IgAN patients and healthy controls and assessed whether IgA1 O-glycosylation is altered by cytokines. Of the eight cytokines tested, only IL-6 and, to a lesser degree, IL-4 significantly increased galactose deficiency of IgA1; changes in IgA1 O-glycosylation were robust for the cells from IgAN patients. These cytokines reduced galactosylation of the O-glycan substrate directly via decreased expression of the galactosyltransferase C1GalT1 and, indirectly, via increased expression of the sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc-II, which prevents galactosylation by C1GalT1. These findings were confirmed by siRNA knockdown of the corresponding genes and by in vitro enzyme reactions. In summary, IL-6 and IL-4 accentuated galactose deficiency of IgA1 via coordinated modulation of key glycosyltransferases.

We used meiotic mapping in 1,497 segregants to localize the mutation to a 42.8-kb intergenic segment on chromosome 2. Resequencing of this region identified an 8.5-kb early retrotransposon (ETn) insertion within the highly conserved regulatory sequences upstream of Pancreas Specific Transcription Factor, 1a (Ptf1a). This mutation resulted in up to tenfold increased expression of Ptf1a as compared to wild-type embryos at E9.5 but no detectable changes in the expression levels of other neighboring genes. At E9.5, Sd mutants exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in embryonic progenitors of every organ that will manifest a developmental defect: the notochord, the hindgut, and the mesonephric ducts. Moreover, at E 8.5, Sd mutant mice exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, tail bud mesenchyme, and in the notochord, preceding the onset of visible defects such as notochord degeneration. The Sd heterozygote phenotype was not ameliorated by Ptf1a haploinsufficiency, further suggesting that the developmental defects result from ectopic expression of Ptf1a. These data identify disruption of the spatio-temporal pattern of Ptf1a expression as the unifying mechanism underlying the multiple congenital defects in Danforth's short tail mouse. This striking example of an enhancer mutation resulting in profound developmental defects suggests that disruption of conserved regulatory elements may also contribute to human malformation syndromes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Embryonic Development", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Mesoderm", "Mice", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Pancreas", "Retroelements", "Spinal Cord", "Tail", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Lugani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ripla", "Last Name": "Arora", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Papeta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ami", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zongyu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roel", "Last Name": "Sterken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruth A", "Last Name": "Singer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gianluca", "Last Name": "Caridi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Sussel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virginia E", "Last Name": "Papaioannou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23092188", "Title": "IgA nephropathy: molecular mechanisms of the disease.", "Abstract": "Studies of molecular and cellular interactions involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy have revealed the autoimmune nature of this most common primary glomerulonephritis.

As a result, nephritogenic immune complexes form in the circulation and deposit in the glomerular mesangium. Deposited immune complexes induce proliferation of resident mesangial cells, increased production of extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines, and ultimately loss of glomerular function.
