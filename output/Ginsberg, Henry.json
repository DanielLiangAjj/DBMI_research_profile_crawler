Importantly, insulin resistance, excess caloric intake, and lack of physical activity are associated with overproduction of VLDL, hepatic steatosis, and increased plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. Cholesterol and triglycerides in remnant particles generated by VLDL lipolysis are risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and have garnered increasing attention over the last few decades. Presently, however, increased risk of atherosclerosis is not the only concern when considering today's cardiometabolic patients, as they often also experience hepatic steatosis, a prevalent disorder that can progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. This duality of metabolic risk highlights the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of the biogenesis of VLDL, the lipoprotein that transports triglycerides and cholesterol out of the liver. Fortunately, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intracellular assembly, trafficking, degradation, and secretion of VLDL by hepatocytes, which has led to many exciting new molecular insights that are the topic of this review. Increasing our understanding of the biology of this pathway will aid to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve both the cardiovascular and the hepatic health of cardiometabolic patients.

TorsinA is an atypical ATPase that lacks intrinsic activity unless it is bound to its activator, lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) or luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1). We previously demonstrated that depletion of LAP1 from hepatocytes has more modest effects on liver triglyceride secretion and steatosis development than depletion of torsinA. We now show that depletion of LULL1 alone does not significantly decrease triglyceride secretion or cause steatosis. However, simultaneous depletion of both LAP1 and LULL1 leads to defective triglyceride secretion and marked steatosis similar to that observed with depletion of torsinA.

Methods and Results In this observational study using longitudinal data from the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) lipid trial, time-varying (achieved) HDL-C updated at 4, 8, and 12\u2009months, and annually thereafter over a mean of 4.7\u2009years, was analyzed in relation to risk of CAD and secondary outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariables among participants with (n=1781) and without (n=3191) the Hp2-2 phenotype. HDL-C did not differ between the phenotypes throughout the study. Having low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL for male participants and <50 mg/dL for female participants) was associated with a greater risk of CAD compared with non-low HDL-C among participants with the non-Hp2-2 phenotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18-1.87]) but not among the Hp2-2 phenotype (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.70-1.35]; P interaction=0.03). Similarly, an inverse relationship was observed between HDL-C quintiles and CAD risk among participants without the Hp2-2 phenotype, whereas no significant inverse relationship was observed among participants with the Hp2-2 phenotype (P interaction=0.38). Among the Hp2-2 phenotype group, having low HDL-C was associated with higher risk of CVD mortality (HR, 2.09 [95% CI, 1.05-4.13]), and compared with the lowest HDL-C quintile, higher quintiles were associated with lower risk of CVD mortality and congestive heart failure.

Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity is negatively associated with atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in humans, but the mechanisms are unknown. We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

The p.E167K variant was associated with increased hepatic fat content and reduced levels of plasma TG and LDL cholesterol. Over the next several years, additional studies defined the role of TM6SF2, which resides in the ER and the ER-Golgi interface, in the lipidation of nascent VLDL to generate mature, more TG-rich VLDL. Consistent results from cells and rodents indicated that the secretion of TG was reduced in the p.E167K variant or when hepatic TM6SF2 was deleted. However, data for secretion of APOB was inconsistent, either reduced or increased secretion was observed. A recent study of people homozygous for the variant demonstrated reduced in vivo secretion of large, TG-rich VLDL1 into plasma; both TG and APOB secretion were reduced. Here we present new results demonstrating increased secretion of VLDL APOB with no change in TG secretion in p.E167K homozygous individuals from the Lancaster Amish community compared to their wild-type siblings.

High levels of Lp(a) confer an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Most people have two circulating isoforms of apo(a) differing in their molecular mass, determined by the number of Kringle IV Type 2 repeats. Previous studies report a strong inverse relationship between Lp(a) levels and apo(a) isoform sizes. The roles of Lp(a) production and fractional clearance and how ancestry affects this relationship remain incompletely defined. We therefore examined the relationships of apo(a) size with Lp(a) levels and both apo(a) fractional clearance rates (FCR) and production rates (PR) in 32 individuals not on lipid-lowering treatment. We determined plasma Lp(a) levels and apo(a) isoform sizes, and used the relative expression of the two isoforms to calculate a \"weighted isoform size\" (wIS). Stable isotope studies were performed, using D3-leucine, to determine the apo(a) FCR and PR. As expected, plasma Lp(a) concentrations were inversely correlated with wIS (R2\u00a0= 0.27; P\u00a0= 0.002). The wIS had a modest positive correlation with apo(a) FCR (R2\u00a0= 0.10, P\u00a0= 0.08), and a negative correlation with apo(a) PR (R2\u00a0= 0.11; P\u00a0= 0.06). The relationship between wIS and PR became significant when we controlled for self-reported race and ethnicity (SRRE) (R2\u00a0= 0.24, P\u00a0= 0.03); controlling for SRRE did not affect the relationship between wIS and FCR.

However, LDs have been observed inside nuclei in some cells, although recent research on nuclear LDs has focused on cultured cell lines. To better understand nuclear LDs that occur in\u00a0vivo, here we examined LDs in primary hepatocytes from mice following depletion of the nuclear envelope protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1). Microscopic image analysis showed that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes contain frequent nuclear LDs, which differ from cytoplasmic LDs in their associated proteins. We found type 1 nucleoplasmic reticula, which are invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane, are often associated with nuclear LDs in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo depletion of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C from mouse hepatocytes led to severely abnormal nuclear morphology, but significantly fewer nuclear LDs than were observed upon depletion of LAP1. In addition, we show both high-fat diet feeding and fasting of mice increased cytoplasmic lipids in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes but reduced nuclear LDs, demonstrating a relationship of LD formation with nutritional state. Finally, depletion of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein did not change the frequency of nuclear LDs in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes, suggesting that it is not required for the biogenesis of nuclear LDs in these cells. Together, these data show that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes represent an ideal mammalian system to investigate the biogenesis of nuclear LDs and their partitioning between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to changes in nutritional state and cellular metabolism in\u00a0vivo.", "Keywords": ["animal models", "cell biology", "high-fat diet", "lamin", "lipid droplet", "liver", "mouse genetics", "nucleus", "nutritional state", "type 1 nucleoplasmic reticula"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Lipid Droplets", "Nuclear Envelope", "Lamin Type A", "Hepatocytes", "Membrane Proteins", "Peptides", "Lipids", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "\u00d6stlund", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Hernandez-Ono", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha J", "Last Name": "Turk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William T", "Last Name": "Dauer", "Affiliation": "Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard J", "Last Name": "Worman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ji-Yeon", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

However, even under optimal statin therapy, a significant residual ASCVD risk remains. Therefore, there has been an unmet clinical need for novel lipid-lowering agents that can target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other atherogenic particles. During the past decade, several drugs have been developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), shows comparable effects to that of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. Bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, is a valuable treatment option for the patients with statin intolerance. Pemafibrate, the first selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, showed a favorable benefit-risk balance in phase 2 trial, but the large clinical phase 3 trial (PROMINENT) was recently stopped for futility based on a late interim analysis. High dose icosapent ethyl, a modified eicosapentaenoic acid preparation, shows cardiovascular benefits. Evinacumab, an angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) monoclonal antibody, reduces plasma LDL-C levels in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. Novel antisense oligonucleotides targeting apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), ANGPTL3, and lipoprotein(a) have significantly attenuated the levels of their target molecules with beneficial effects on associated dyslipidemias. Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is considered as a potential treatment to exploit the athero-protective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but solid clinical evidence is necessary.

FGF19/15 is transcribed and released from enterocytes of the small intestine into enterohepatic circulation in response to bile-induced FXR activation. Previously, the TSS of FGF19 was identified to bind Wnt-regulated TCF7L2/encoded transcription factor TCF4 in colorectal cancer cells. Impaired Wnt signaling and specifical loss of function of its coreceptor LRP6\u00a0have been associated with NASH. We, therefore, examined if TCF7L2/TCF4 upregulates Fgf19 in the small intestine and restrains NASH through gut-liver crosstalk. We examined the mice globally overexpressing, haploinsufficient, and conditional knockout models of TCF7L2 in the intestinal epithelium. The TCF7L2+/- mice exhibited increased plasma bile salts and lipids and developed diet-induced fatty liver disease while mice globally overexpressing TCF7L2 were protected against these traits. Comprehensive in vivo analysis revealed that TCF7L2 transcriptionally upregulates FGF15 in the gut, leading to reduced bile synthesis and diminished intestinal lipid uptake. Accordingly, VilinCreert2 ; Tcf7L2fl/fl mice showed reduced Fgf19 in the ileum, and increased plasma bile. The global overexpression of TCF7L2 in mice with metabolic syndrome-linked LRP6R611C substitution rescued the fatty liver and fibrosis in the latter. Strikingly, the hepatic levels of TCF4 were reduced and CYP7a1 was increased in human NASH, indicating the relevance of TCF4-dependent regulation of bile synthesis to human disease.

For many years, plasma LDL-C levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation, but there are limitations to this method compared with direct measurement via beta-quantification (BQ).

All randomized patients were included irrespective of the treatment arm (n\u00a0= 6,122). We compared pairs of LDL-C values (n = 17,077) determined by each equation and BQ. We found that BQ-derived LDL-C values ranged from 1 to 397\u00a0mg/dl (mean 90.68\u00a0mg/dl).

This review summarizes recent advances, challenges, and future directions in liver microtissue research. Cellular engineering approaches are used to sustain primary hepatocytes or produce hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and other adult tissues. Three-dimensional microtissues are generated by scaffold-free assembly or scaffold-assisted methods such as macroencapsulation, droplet microfluidics, and bioprinting. Optimization of the hepatic microenvironment entails incorporating the appropriate cell composition for enhanced cell-cell interactions and niche-specific signals, and creating scaffolds with desired chemical, mechanical and physical properties. Perfusion-based culture systems such as bioreactors and microfluidic systems are used to achieve efficient exchange of nutrients and soluble factors. Taken together, systematic optimization of liver microtissues is a multidisciplinary effort focused on creating liver cultures and on-chip models with greater structural complexity and physiological relevance for use in liver disease research, therapeutic development, and regenerative medicine.", "Keywords": ["biomaterials", "liver microtissues", "microenvironment", "regenerative medicine", "tissue engineering"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dantong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah B", "Last Name": "Gibeley", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ozgenur", "Last Name": "Celik", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Advanced functional materials", "PubDate": "2020Oct28"}, {"PMID": "32982991", "Title": "Hypertriglyceridemia-Causes, Significance, and Approaches to Therapy.", "Abstract": "Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a common metabolic disorder with both genetic and lifestyle factors playing significant roles in its pathophysiology.

Moreover, a large number of people with prediabetes are at risk for developing frank diabetes worldwide. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even with statin treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, patients with diabetes have a high residual CVD risk. Factors mediating the residual risk are incompletely characterized. An attractive hypothesis is that remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs), derived by lipolysis from VLDL and chylomicrons, contribute to this residual risk. RLPs constitute a heterogeneous population of lipoprotein particles, varying markedly in size and composition. Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, for the purpose of this review we define RLPs as postlipolytic partially triglyceride-depleted particles derived from chylomicrons and VLDL that are relatively enriched in cholesteryl esters and apolipoprotein (apo)E. RLPs derived from chylomicrons contain apoB48, while those derived from VLDL contain apoB100. Clarity as to the role of RLPs in CVD risk is hampered by lack of a widely accepted definition and a paucity of adequate methods for their accurate and precise quantification. New specific methods for RLP quantification would greatly improve our understanding of their biology and role in promoting atherosclerosis in diabetes and other disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Chylomicrons", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Humans", "Lipoproteins", "Lipoproteins, VLDL", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Chait", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medicine Diabetes Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Vaisar", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medicine Diabetes Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Jay W", "Last Name": "Heinecke", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medicine Diabetes Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Ira J", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, New York University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Karin E", "Last Name": "Bornfeldt", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medicine Diabetes Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA bornf@uw.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "32052833", "Title": "Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: pathophysiological, genetic, and therapeutic insights: a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Consensus", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Bor\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "M John", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology-Metabolism Division, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re University Hospital, Sorbonne University, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ronald M", "Last Name": "Krauss", "Affiliation": "Department of Atherosclerosis Research, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute and UCSF, Oakland, CA 94609, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris J", "Last Name": "Packard", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jacob F", "Last Name": "Bentzon", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Heart Diseases, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Christoph J", "Last Name": "Binder", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Mat J", "Last Name": "Daemen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Linda L", "Last Name": "Demer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Hegele", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Nicholls", "Affiliation": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "B\u00f8rge G", "Last Name": "Nordestgaard", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, The Copenhagen General Population Study, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Gerald F", "Last Name": "Watts", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Bruckert", "Affiliation": "INSERM UMRS1166, Department of Endocrinology-Metabolism, ICAN -

We investigated whether genetic variability in the PPARA gene, coding for the pharmacological target of fibrates (PPAR-\u03b1), could be used to improve the selection of patients with type 2 diabetes who may derive cardiovascular benefit from addition of this treatment to statins. We identified a common variant at the PPARA locus (rs6008845, C/T) displaying a study-wide significant influence on the effect of fenofibrate on major cardiovascular events (MACE) among 3,065 self-reported white subjects treated with simvastatin and randomized to fenofibrate or placebo in the ACCORD-Lipid trial. T/T homozygotes (36% of participants) experienced a 51% MACE reduction in response to fenofibrate (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.34-0.72), whereas no benefit was observed for other genotypes (P interaction = 3.7 \u00d7 10-4). The rs6008845-by-fenofibrate interaction on MACE was replicated in African Americans from ACCORD (N = 585, P = 0.02) and in external cohorts (ACCORD-BP, ORIGIN, and TRIUMPH, total N = 3059, P = 0.005). Remarkably, rs6008845 T/T homozygotes experienced a cardiovascular benefit from fibrate even in the absence of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Among these individuals, but not among carriers of other genotypes, fenofibrate treatment was associated with lower circulating levels of CCL11-a proinflammatory and atherogenic chemokine also known as eotaxin (P for rs6008845-by-fenofibrate interaction = 0.003). The GTEx data set revealed regulatory functions of rs6008845 on PPARA expression in many tissues. In summary, we have found a common PPARA regulatory variant that influences the cardiovascular effects of fenofibrate and that could be used to identify patients with type 2 diabetes who would derive benefit from fenofibrate treatment, in addition to those with atherogenic dyslipidemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chemokines", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Female", "Fenofibrate", "Genotype", "Humans", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Lipids", "Male", "Middle Aged", "PPAR alpha", "Pharmacogenetics", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mario Luca", "Last Name": "Morieri", "Affiliation": "Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Hetal S", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Sjaarda", "Affiliation": "McMaster University and Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Petra A", "Last Name": "Lenzini", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Alison A", "Last Name": "Motsinger-Reif", "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC."}, {"First Name": "He", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Lovato", "Affiliation": "Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Prudente", "Affiliation": "Research Unit of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Assunta", "Last Name": "Pandolfi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University \"G. d'Annunzio,\" Chieti, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marcus G", "Last Name": "Pezzolesi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology and Hypertension and Diabetes and Metabolism Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT."}, {"First Name": "Ronald J", "Last Name": "Sigal", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Cardiac Sciences, and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, Faculties of Medicine and Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Guillaume", "Last Name": "Par\u00e9", "Affiliation": "McMaster University and Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Santica M", "Last Name": "Marcovina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, and Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Rotroff", "Affiliation": "Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH."}, {"First Name": "Elisabetta", "Last Name": "Patorno", "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Luana", "Last Name": "Mercuri", "Affiliation": "Research Unit of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo", "Last Name": "Trischitta", "Affiliation": "Research Unit of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Emily Y", "Last Name": "Chew", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Kraft", "Affiliation": "Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are epigenetic modulators of inflammation, thrombogenesis, and lipoprotein metabolism implicated in atherothrombosis. The BETonMACE trial tests the hypothesis that treatment with apabetalone, a selective BET protein inhibitor, will improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes after an ACS. DESIGN: Patients (n\u202f=\u202f2425) with ACS in the preceding 7 to 90 days, with type 2 diabetes and low HDL cholesterol (\u226440 mg/dl for men, \u226445 mg/dl for women), receiving intensive or maximum-tolerated therapy with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, were assigned in double-blind fashion to receive apabetalone 100 mg orally twice daily or matching placebo. Baseline characteristics include female sex (25%), myocardial infarction as index ACS event (74%), coronary revascularization for index ACS (80%), treatment with dual anti-platelet therapy (87%) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (91%), median LDL cholesterol 65 mg per deciliter, and median HbA1c 7.3%. The primary efficacy measure is time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. Assumptions include a primary event rate of 7% per annum in the placebo group and median follow-up of 1.5 years. Patients will be followed until at least 250 primary endpoint events have occurred, providing 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in the primary endpoint with apabetalone. SUMMARY: BETonMACE will determine whether the addition of the selective BET protein inhibitor apabetalone to contemporary standard of care for ACS reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Using two mouse models of T1DM, the authors investigated APOC3-mediated inhibition of both TG hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase and hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. They suggest that poorly catabolized lipoproteins, enriched in both APOC3 and APOE content, are particularly atherogenic. Notably, treating both mouse models with an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide lowered both plasma APOC3 and TRLs, and prevented atherosclerosis.

We showed that conditional hepatocyte deletion of the inner nuclear membrane protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) caused defective VLDL secretion and steatosis, including intranuclear lipid accumulation. LAP1 binds to and activates torsinA, an AAA+ ATPase that resides in the perinuclear space and continuous main ER. Deletion of torsinA from mouse hepatocytes caused even greater reductions in VLDL secretion and profound steatosis. Both of these mutant mouse lines developed hepatic steatosis and subsequent steatohepatitis on a regular chow diet in the absence of whole-body insulin resistance or obesity.

The discovery that 5% of Lancaster Old Order Amish are heterozygous for the APOC3 R19X null mutation provided the opportunity to determine the effects of a naturally occurring reduction in apo CIII levels on the metabolism of atherogenic containing lipoproteins. Approach and Results- We conducted stable isotope studies of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in 5 individuals heterozygous for the null mutation APOC3 R19X (CT) and their unaffected (CC) siblings. Fractional clearance rates and production rates of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL, apo CIII, and apo CII were determined. Affected (CT) individuals had 49% reduction in plasma apo CIII levels compared with CCs ( P<0.01) and reduced plasma levels of TG (35%, P<0.02), VLDL-TG (45%, P<0.02), and VLDL-apoB100 (36%, P<0.05). These changes were because of higher fractional clearance rates of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB100 with no differences in production rates. CTs had higher rates of the conversion of VLDL remnants to LDL compared with CCs. In contrast, rates of direct removal of VLDL remnants did not differ between the groups. As a result, the flux of apoB100 from VLDL to LDL was not reduced, and the plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and LDL-apoB100 were not lower in the CT group. Apo CIII production rate was lower in CTs compared with CCs, whereas apo CII production rate was not different between the 2 groups. The fractional clearance rates of both apo CIII and apo CII were higher in CTs than CCs. Conclusions- These studies demonstrate that 50% reductions in plasma apo CIII, in otherwise healthy subjects, results in a significantly higher rate of conversion of VLDL to LDL, with little effect on direct hepatic uptake of VLDL. When put in the context of studies demonstrating significant protection from cardiovascular events in individuals with loss of function variants in the APOC3 gene, our results provide strong evidence that therapies which increase the efficiency of conversion of VLDL to LDL, thereby reducing remnant concentrations, should reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.", "Keywords": ["apolipoprotein C-III", "cardiovascular diseases", "isotopes", "lipolysis", "lipoprotein lipase"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Apolipoprotein B-100", "Apolipoprotein C-III", "Female", "Humans", "Lipids", "Lipolysis", "Lipoproteins", "Lipoproteins, IDL", "Lipoproteins, VLDL", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gissette", "Last Name": "Reyes-Soffer", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Carol", "Last Name": "Sztalryd", "Affiliation": "Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore (C.S., R.B.H., T.I.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Richard B", "Last Name": "Horenstein", "Affiliation": "Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore (C.S., R.B.H., T.I.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Holleran", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Anastasiya", "Last Name": "Matveyenko", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Renu", "Last Name": "Nandakumar", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Ngai", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Wahida", "Last Name": "Karmally", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Rajasekhar", "Last Name": "Ramakrishnan", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (G.R.-S., S.H., A.M., T.T., R.N., C.N., W.K., H.N.G., R.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Toni I", "Last Name": "Pollin", "Affiliation": "Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore (C.S., R.B.H., T.I.P.)."}], "Journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "30371190", "Title": "Lower On-Treatment Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Women and Men: Pooled Analysis of 10 ODYSSEY Phase 3 Alirocumab Trials.", "Abstract": "Background In statin trials, men and women derived similar relative risk reductions in cardiovascular events per 39\u00a0mg/ dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) reduction. We explored whether lower LDL -C levels and greater LDL -C percentage reductions than those achieved with statins are associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) rates in women as well as men. Methods and Results Data pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY randomized trials (n=4983) comparing alirocumab with control (placebo/ezetimibe) were assessed for association between 39\u00a0mg/dL lower on-treatment LDL -C and percentage LDL -C change from baseline, and MACE risk by sex, using multivariable Cox regression. Mean baseline LDL -C was 135\u00a0mg/dL (women) and 121\u00a0mg/dL (men). Average on-treatment LDL -C levels with alirocumab, ezetimibe, and placebo were 71, 114, and 134\u00a0mg/dL, respectively, in women (n=1882) and 52, 93, and 122\u00a0mg/dL, respectively, in men (n=3090). Overall, 36.5% and 58.7% of women and men, respectively, achieved on-treatment LDL -C <50\u00a0mg/dL. Each 39\u00a0mg/dL lower LDL -C was associated with a 33% and 22%\u00a0lower risk of MACE in women ( P=0.0209) and men ( P=0.0307), respectively, with no significant between-sex difference ( P for heterogeneity=0.4597). Results were similar when analyzed per 50% LDL -C reduction, 24% ( P=0.1094) and 29% ( P=0.0125) lower MACE risk in women and men, respectively ( P for heterogeneity=0.7499).

Novel treatments that decrease LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) have also shown promise for reducing Lp(a) levels.

It decreases plasma levels of LDL-C by 25% to 39% and lowers levels of Lp(a) by 21% to 39%. We examined the mechanisms for Lp(a) lowering during mipomersen treatment. We enrolled 14 healthy volunteers who received weekly placebo injections for 3 weeks followed by weekly injections of mipomersen for 7 weeks. Stable isotope kinetic studies were performed using deuterated leucine at the end of the placebo and mipomersen treatment periods. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of Lp(a) was determined from the enrichment of a leucine-containing peptide specific to apo(a) by LC/MS. The production rate (PR) of Lp(a) was calculated from the product of Lp(a) FCR and Lp(a) concentration (converted to pool size).

In the overall study group, mipomersen treatment resulted in a 27% increase in the FCR of Lp(a) with no significant change in PR. However, there was heterogeneity in the response to mipomersen therapy, and changes in both FCRs and PRs affected the degree of change in Lp(a) concentrations.

In this work, we show that mice with liver-specific triple FoxO knockout (L-FoxO1,3,4), which are known to have reduced hepatic glucose production, also have increased HDL-C.

Fibrates are a class of drugs prescribed to treat dyslipidemia, but variation in response has been observed. To evaluate common and rare genetic variants that impact lipid responses to fenofibrate in statin-treated patients with T2D, we examined lipid changes in response to fenofibrate therapy using a genomewide association study (GWAS). Associations were followed-up using gene expression studies in mice. Common variants in SMAD3 and IPO11 were marginally associated with lipid changes in black subjects (P < 5 \u00d7 10-6 ). Rare variant and gene expression changes were assessed using a false discovery rate approach. AKR7A3 and HSD17B13 were associated with lipid changes in white subjects (q < 0.2). Mice fed fenofibrate displayed reductions in Hsd17b13 gene expression (q < 0.1). Associations of variants in SMAD3, IPO11, and HSD17B13, with gene expression changes in mice indicate that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and NRF2 signaling pathways may influence fenofibrate effects on dyslipidemia in patients with T2D.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aldehyde Reductase", "Animals", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Female", "Fenofibrate", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Lipid Metabolism", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Pharmacogenomic Testing", "Signal Transduction", "Smad3 Protein", "beta Karyopherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Rotroff", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonja S", "Last Name": "Pijut", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Skylar W", "Last Name": "Marvel", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Jack", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tammy M", "Last Name": "Havener", "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aurora", "Last Name": "Pujol", "Affiliation": "Neurometabolic Diseases Laboratory, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), and CIBERER U759, Center for Biomedical Research on Rare Diseases, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Agatha", "Last Name": "Schluter", "Affiliation": "Neurometabolic Diseases Laboratory, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), and CIBERER U759, Center for Biomedical Research on Rare Diseases, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Graf", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hetal S", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "He", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mario-Luca", "Last Name": "Morieri", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Doria", "Affiliation": "Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Josyf C", "Last Name": "Mychaleckyi", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard L", "Last Name": "McLeod", "Affiliation": "Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "John B", "Last Name": "Buse", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Wagner", "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison A", "Last Name": "Motsinger-Reif", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "ACCORD/ACCORDion Investigators", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "28729361", "Title": "CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) Inhibition With Anacetrapib Decreases Production of Lipoprotein(a) in Mildly Hypercholesterolemic Subjects.", "Abstract": "Lp(a) [lipoprotein (a)] is composed of apoB (apolipoprotein B) and apo(a) [apolipoprotein (a)] and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis.

Specifically, there is ongoing controversy about where apo(a) and apoB-100 bind to form Lp(a); which apoB-100 lipoproteins bind to apo(a) to create Lp(a); whether binding of apo(a) is reversible, allowing apo(a) to bind to more than one apoB-100 lipoprotein during its lifespan in the circulation; and how Lp(a) or apo(a) leave the circulation.

Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Blood Glucose", "Computational Biology", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Male", "Patient-Specific Modeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Gluckman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Engineering Sciences and Mechanics, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lena", "Last Name": "Mamykina", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "28444290", "Title": "Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 1.

Anacetrapib increased the VLDL-TG FCR by enhancing the lipolytic potential of VLDL, which lowered the VLDL-TG pool on atorvastatin background.

Vorinostat, an FDA-approved inhibitor of histone deacetylases, ameliorates lysosomal lipid accumulation in cultured NP-C patient fibroblasts. To assess the therapeutic potential of histone deacetylase inhibition, we pursued these in vitro observations in two murine models of NP-C disease. Npc1nmf164 mice, which express a missense mutation in the Npc1 gene, were treated intraperitoneally, from weaning, with the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat (150 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Disease progression was measured via gene expression, liver function and pathology, serum and tissue lipid levels, body weight, and life span. Transcriptome analyses of treated livers indicated multiple changes consistent with reversal of liver dysfunction that typifies NP-C disease. Significant improvements in liver pathology and function were achieved by this treatment regimen; however, NPC1 protein maturation and levels, disease progression, weight loss, and animal morbidity were not detectably altered. Vorinostat concentrations were >200 \u03bcm in the plasma compartment of treated animals but were almost 100-fold lower in brain tissue. Apolipoprotein B metabolism and the expression of key components of lipid homeostasis in primary hepatocytes from null (Npc1-/-) and missense (Npc1nmf164 ) mutant mice were altered by vorinostat treatment, consistent with a response by these cells independent of the status of the Npc1 locus.

Approaches targeting apoB synthesis, which lies upstream of VLDL secretion, have potential to effectively reduce dyslipidemia but can also lead to hepatic accumulation of unsecreted triglycerides (TG). Here, we found that treating mice with apoB antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for 6 weeks decreased VLDL secretion and plasma cholesterol without causing steatosis. The absence of steatosis was linked to an increase in ER stress in the first 3 weeks of ASO treatment, followed by development of ER autophagy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. The latter resulted in increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation that was inhibited by both chloroquine and 3-methyl adenine, consistent with trafficking of ER TG through the autophagic pathway before oxidation. These findings support the concept that inhibition of apoB synthesis traps lipids that have been transferred to the ER by microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), inducing ER stress. ER stress then triggers ER autophagy and subsequent lysosomal lipolysis of TG, followed by mitochondrial oxidation of released FA, leading to prevention of steatosis. The identification of this pathway indicates that inhibition of VLDL secretion remains a viable target for therapies aiming to reduce circulating levels of atherogenic apoB lipoproteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apolipoproteins B", "Atherosclerosis", "Autophagy", "Carrier Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Dyslipidemias", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Fatty Acids", "Fatty Liver", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donna M", "Last Name": "Conlon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatyana", "Last Name": "Fedotova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Hernandez-Ono", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gilbert", "Last Name": "Di Paolo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin B", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Ruggles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Gibeley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2016Oct03"}, {"PMID": "27486125", "Title": "Lipid changes during basal insulin peglispro, insulin glargine, or NPH treatment in six IMAGINE trials.", "Abstract": "Basal insulin peglispro (BIL) is a novel basal insulin with hepato-preferential action resulting from reduced peripheral effects.

Secondary goals were to determine whether subnephrotic proteinuria, apolipoprotein (apo)C-III and insulin resistance modify the CKD effect.

Response was assessed by the incremental area under the\u00a0curve of triglycerides and of apoB-48. The primary hypothesis was tested by correlation to estimated GFR. Significantly, for every 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated GFR, the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides was 17% greater while that of apoB-48 was 16% greater. Univariate analyses also showed that the incremental area\u00a0under the curve of triglycerides and apoB-48 were significantly associated with subnephrotic proteinuria, apoC-III, and insulin resistance. In multivariate analysis, CKD and insulin resistance were independently associated with increased area under the curve and were each linked\u00a0to increased levels of apoC-III. Thus, postprandial triglyceride and chylomicron plasma excursions are increased in direct proportion to the degree of CKD.

its low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering effects should therefore result from reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). We enrolled 17 healthy volunteers who received placebo injections weekly for 3 weeks followed by mipomersen weekly for 7 to 9 weeks. Stable isotopes were used after each treatment to determine fractional catabolic rates and production rates of apoB in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), and LDL, and of triglycerides in VLDL. Mipomersen significantly reduced apoB in VLDL, IDL, and LDL, which was associated with increases in fractional catabolic rates of VLDL and LDL apoB and reductions in production rates of IDL and LDL apoB. Unexpectedly, the production rates of VLDL apoB and VLDL triglycerides were unaffected. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of apoB expression in human liver cells demonstrated preservation of apoB secretion across a range of apoB synthesis. Titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in chow-fed mice preserved both apoB and triglyceride secretion. In contrast, titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in high-fat-fed mice resulted in stepwise reductions in both apoB and triglyceride secretion. Mipomersen lowered all apoB lipoproteins without reducing the production rate of either VLDL apoB or triglyceride. Our human data are consistent with long-standing models of posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of apoB secretion and are supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Fenofibrate treatment partially reverses dyslipidemia in these subjects. However, a paradoxical marked reduction in HDL-C and HDL's major protein, apolipoprotein A-I, is a complication of fenofibrate in combination with rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent. Risk factors for this condition, termed hypoalphalipoproteinemia, have yet to be identified. Using a case-control study design with subjects enrolled in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, we tested the hypothesis that alterations in HDL's protein cargo predispose diabetic subjects to fenofibrate/rosiglitazone-induced hypoalphalipoproteinemia. HDL was isolated from blood obtained from controls (no decreases or increase in HDL-C while receiving fenofibrate/rosiglitazone therapy) and cases (developed hypoalphalipoproteinemia after fenofibrate/rosiglitazone treatment) participating in the ACCORD study before they began fenofibrate/rosiglitazone treatment. HDL proteins were quantified by targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with isotope dilution. This approach demonstrated marked increases in the relative concentrations of paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1), apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), apolipoprotein C-I, and apolipoprotein H in the HDL of subjects who developed hypoalphalipoproteinemia. The case and control subjects did not differ significantly in baseline HDL-C levels or other traditional lipid risk factors. We used orthogonal biochemical techniques to confirm increased levels of PON1 and APOC2. Our observations suggest that an imbalance in HDL proteins predisposes diabetic subjects to develop hypoalphalipoproteinemia on fenofibrate/rosiglitazone therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Apolipoprotein C-II", "Aryldialkylphosphatase", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Fenofibrate", "Humans", "Hypoalphalipoproteinemias", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proteomics", "Risk Factors", "Rosiglitazone", "Thiazolidinediones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Graziella E", "Last Name": "Ronsein", "Affiliation": "From the \u2021Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98109; ronsein@iq.usp.br."}, {"First Name": "Gissette", "Last Name": "Reyes-Soffer", "Affiliation": "\u00a7 Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Department of Medicine, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "From the \u2021Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98109;"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Oda", "Affiliation": "\u00b6Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA 94609."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "\u00a7 Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Department of Medicine, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Jay W", "Last Name": "Heinecke", "Affiliation": "From the \u2021Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98109;"}], "Journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "PubDate": "2016Mar"}, {"PMID": "26376908", "Title": "Nonstatin Low-Density Lipoprotein-Lowering Therapy and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction-Statement From ATVB Council.", "Abstract": "Pharmacological reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol using statin drugs is foundational therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here, we consider the place of nonstatin therapies that also reduce LDL cholesterol in prevention of CVD. Among conventional nonstatins, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials showed that bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates given as monotherapy each reduce CVD end points. From trials in which patients' LDL cholesterol was already well controlled on a statin, adding ezetimibe incrementally reduced CVD end points, whereas adding a fibrate or niacin showed no incremental benefit. Among emerging nonstatins, monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 added to a statin and given for \u226478 weeks showed preliminary evidence of reductions in CVD outcomes. Although these promising early findings contributed to the recent approval of these agents in Europe and in North America, much larger and longer duration outcomes studies are ongoing for definitive proof of CVD benefits. Other nonstatin agents recently approved in the United States include lomitapide and mipomersen, which both act via distinctive LDL receptor independent mechanisms to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We also address some unanswered questions, including measuring alternative biochemical variables to LDL cholesterol, evidence for treating children with monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis, and potential risks of extremely low LDL cholesterol. As evidence for benefit in CVD prevention accumulates, we anticipate that clinical practice will shift toward more assertive LDL-lowering treatment, using both statins and nonstatins initiated earlier in appropriately selected patients.", "Keywords": ["LDL", "atherosclerosis", "cardiovascular diseases", "cholesterol", "guideline", "lipids", "lipoproteins", "therapeutics"], "MeSH terms": ["Anticholesteremic Agents", "Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Down-Regulation", "Humans", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Hegele", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Medicine, Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada (R.A.H.); Nemours Cardiac Center, A.

Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C \u22655 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C \u22654 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is \u22653.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.", "Keywords": ["Adolescents", "Children", "Consensus statement", "Diagnosis", "Ezetimibe", "Familial hypercholesterolaemia", "LDL cholesterol", "PCSK9 inhibitor", "Statin", "Treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Atherosclerosis", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Child", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Cost of Illness", "Counseling", "Diet", "Dietary Supplements", "Early Diagnosis", "Economics, Medical", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Life Expectancy", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "Wiegman", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands a.wiegman@amc.uva.nl."}, {"First Name": "Samuel S", "Last Name": "Gidding", "Affiliation": "Nemours Cardiac Center, A.

This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7-29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge.

Dgat1(-/-) mice exhibit a number of beneficial metabolic effects including reduced obesity and improved insulin sensitivity and no known cardiac dysfunction. In contrast, failing human hearts have severely reduced DGAT1 expression associated with accumulation of DAGs and ceramides. To test whether DGAT1 loss alone affects heart function, we created cardiomyocyte-specific DGAT1 knock-out (hDgat1(-/-)) mice. hDgat1(-/-) mouse hearts had 95% increased DAG and 85% increased ceramides compared with floxed controls. 50% of these mice died by 9 months of age. The heart failure marker brain natriuretic peptide increased 5-fold in hDgat1(-/-) hearts, and fractional shortening (FS) was reduced. This was associated with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 and cluster of differentiation 36. We crossed hDgat1(-/-) mice with previously described enterocyte-specific Dgat1 knock-out mice (hiDgat1(-/-)). This corrected the early mortality, improved FS, and reduced cardiac ceramide and DAG content. Treatment of hDgat1(-/-) mice with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exenatide also improved FS and reduced heart DAG and ceramide content. Increased fatty acid uptake into hDgat1(-/-) hearts was normalized by exenatide. Reduced activation of protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1), which is increased by DAG and ceramides, paralleled the reductions in these lipids.

Although statins are generally considered to be safe, recent studies suggest they are associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes (T2D). This led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change their labelling requirements for statins to include a warning about the possibility of increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to issue guidance on a small increased risk of T2D with the statin class. This review examines the evidence leading to these claims and provides practical guidance for primary care physicians on the use of statins in people with or at risk of developing T2D. Overall, evidence suggests that the benefits of statins for the reduction of CV risk far outweigh the risk of developing T2D, especially in individuals with higher CV risk. To reduce the risk of developing T2D, physicians should assess all patients for T2D risk prior to starting statin therapy, educate patients about their risks, and encourage risk-reduction through lifestyle changes. Whether some statins are more diabetogenic than others requires further study. Statin-treated patients at high risk of developing T2D should regularly be monitored for changes in blood glucose or HbA1c levels, and the risk of conversion from pre-diabetes to T2D should be reduced by intensifying lifestyle changes.

Common mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia is typically multigenic, and results from the cumulative burden of common and rare variants in more than 30 genes, as quantified by genetic risk scores. Rare autosomal recessive monogenic hypertriglyceridaemia can result from large-effect mutations in six different genes. Hypertriglyceridaemia is exacerbated by non-genetic factors. On the basis of recent genetic data, we redefine the disorder into two states: severe (triglyceride concentration >10 mmol/L), which is more likely to have a monogenic cause; and mild-to-moderate (triglyceride concentration 2-10 mmol/L). Because of clustering of susceptibility alleles and secondary factors in families, biochemical screening and counselling for family members is essential, but routine genetic testing is not warranted. Treatment includes management of lifestyle and secondary factors, and pharmacotherapy.

While best standards of care, including high-dose statins, can ameliorate the risk of vascular complications, patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) has previously highlighted atherogenic dyslipidaemia, defined as the imbalance between proatherogenic triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B-containing-lipoproteins and antiatherogenic apolipoprotein A-I-lipoproteins (as in high-density lipoprotein, HDL), as an important modifiable contributor to lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk, especially in insulin-resistant conditions. As part of its mission to improve awareness and clinical management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, the R3i has identified three key priorities for action: i) to improve recognition of atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients at high cardiometabolic risk with or without diabetes; ii) to improve implementation and adherence to guideline-based therapies; and iii) to improve therapeutic strategies for managing atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The R3i believes that monitoring of non-HDL cholesterol provides a simple, practical tool for treatment decisions regarding the management of lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk. Addition of a fibrate, niacin (North and South America), omega-3 fatty acids or ezetimibe are all options for combination with a statin to further reduce non-HDL cholesterol, although lacking in hard evidence for cardiovascular outcome benefits. Several emerging treatments may offer promise. These include the next generation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u03b1 agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. However, long-term outcomes and safety data are clearly needed. In conclusion, the R3i believes that ongoing trials with these novel treatments may help to define the optimal management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia to reduce the clinical and socioeconomic burden of residual cardiovascular risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Humans", "Learning", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jean-Charles", "Last Name": "Fruchart", "Affiliation": "R3i Foundation, St, Alban-Anlage 46, Basel, CH 4010, Switzerland. jean-charles.fruchart@r3i.org."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Davignon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel P", "Last Name": "Hermans", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Khalid", "Last Name": "Al-Rubeaan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pierre", "Last Name": "Amarenco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Assmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Barter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Betteridge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Bruckert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ada", "Last Name": "Cuevas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Farnier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ele", "Last Name": "Ferrannini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Fioretto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jacques", "Last Name": "Genest", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Antonio M", "Last Name": "Gotto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dayi", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Kadowaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatsuhiko", "Last Name": "Kodama", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Krempf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuji", "Last Name": "Matsuzawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jes\u00fas Mill\u00e1n", "Last Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cort\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos Calvo", "Last Name": "Monfil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hisao", "Last Name": "Ogawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Plutzky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shaukat", "Last Name": "Sadikot", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raul D", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evgeny", "Last Name": "Shlyakhto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Piyamitr", "Last Name": "Sritara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rody", "Last Name": "Sy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chee Eng", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lale", "Last Name": "Tokg\u00f6zo\u011flu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter P", "Last Name": "Toth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Valensi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Wanner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Zambon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Junren", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Zimmet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "PubDate": "2014Jan24"}, {"PMID": "24382103", "Title": "Monthly haemostatic factor variability in women and men.", "Abstract": "Hormonal status influences haemostatic factors including fibrinogen, factor VII and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and concentrations differ among men, premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

The present studies, employing genetic and nutritional interventions, explored factors that are responsible for regulating RE accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue and how these influence levels of retinoic acid (RA) and RA-responsive gene expression. Our data establish that acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activity is not involved in RE synthesis in the liver, even when mice are nutritionally stressed by feeding a 25-fold excess retinol diet or upon ablation of cellular retinol-binding protein type I (CRBPI), which is proposed to limit retinol availability to ARATs.

However, when CrbpI is also absent, RE levels resemble wild-type levels, suggesting a role for CrbpI in RE accumulation in adipose tissue. Although expression of several RA-responsive genes is elevated in Lrat-deficient liver, employing a sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry protocol and contrary to what has been assumed for many years, we did not detect elevated concentrations of all-trans-RA.

These risk factors individually and interdependently increase the risk of CV and cerebrovascular events, and represent one of the biggest health challenges worldwide today. CV diseases account for almost 50% of all deaths in Europe and around 30% of all deaths worldwide. Furthermore, the risk of CV death is increased twofold to fourfold in people with T2D. Whilst the clinical management of CV disease has improved in Western Europe, the pandemic of obesity and T2D reduces the impact of these gains. This, together with the growing, aging population, means the number of CV deaths is predicted to increase from 17.1 million worldwide in 2004 to 23.6 million in 2030. The recommended treatment for MetS is lifestyle change followed by treatment for the individual risk factors. Numerous studies have shown that lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins can significantly reduce CV risk in people with and without T2D or MetS. However, the risk of major vascular events in those attaining the maximum levels of LDL-C-reduction is only reduced by around one-third, which leaves substantial residual risk. Recent studies suggest that low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (<1 .0 mmol/l; 40 mg/dl) and high triglyceride levels (\u22651.7 mmol/l; 150 mg/dl) are independent risk factors for CV disease and that the relationship between HDL-C and CV risk persists even when on-treatment LDL-C levels are low (<1.7 mmol/l; 70 mg/dl). European guidelines highlight the importance of reducing residual risk by targeting these risk factors in addition to LDL-C. This is particularly important in patients with T2D and MetS because obesity and high levels of glycated hemoglobin are directly related to low levels of HDL-C and high triglyceride. Although most statins have a similar low-density lipoprotein-lowering efficacy, differences in chemical structure and pharmacokinetic profile can lead to variations in pleiotropic effects (for example, high-density lipoprotein-elevating efficacy), adverse event profiles, and drug-drug interactions. The choice of statin should therefore depend on the needs of the individual patient. The following reviews will discuss the potential benefits of pitavastatin versus other statins in the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia and MetS or T2D, focusing on its effects on HDL-C quantity and quality, its potential impact on atherosclerosis and CV risk, and its metabolic characteristics that reduce the risk of drug interactions.

This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis.

Improvements in the ability to readily and reliably measure the kinetics of apo(a) using a stable isotope labeled tracer is expected to facilitate studies of the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular disease.

We aimed to develop a rapid and efficient method for studying apo(a) kinetics that is suitable for use in studies involving human subjects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Apolipoproteins A", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Microfluidic Analytical Techniques", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haihong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Molecular Biomarkers-PPDM, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Castro-Perez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Lassman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wenyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Theresa", "Last Name": "McLaughlin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xie", "Last Name": "Dan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Jumes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Wagner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Gutstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian K", "Last Name": "Hubbard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Millar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gissette", "Last Name": "Reyes-Soffer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Cleary", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen F", "Last Name": "Previs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas P", "Last Name": "Roddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM", "PubDate": "2013Jun30"}, {"PMID": "23593417", "Title": "Recombinant human growth hormone and rosiglitazone for abdominal fat accumulation in HIV-infected patients with insulin resistance: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial trial.", "Abstract": "Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume in HIV-infected patients but can worsen glucose homeostasis and lipoatrophy.
