This randomized controlled study assessed the efficacy of a brief social contact-based video intervention in reducing self-stigma in a large sample of individuals ages 18-35 endorsing an ongoing mental health condition. We hypothesized that the brief video would reduce self-stigma. Methods: In January and February 2023, we recruited and assigned 1,214 participants to a brief video-based intervention depicting a young individual living with mental illness sharing his personal story or to a non-intervention control. In the 2-minute video, informed by focus groups, a young individual described struggles with mental illness symptoms; this was balanced with descriptions of living a meaningful and productive life. Self-stigma assessments (Stereotype Endorsement, Alienation, Stigma Resistance, Perceived Devaluation Discrimination, Secrecy, and Recovery Assessment Scale) were conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 30-day follow-up. Results: A 2\u2009\u2715\u20093 group-by-time analysis of variance showed that mean self-stigma scores decreased in the intervention arm relative to control across 5 of 6 self-stigma domains: Stereotype Endorsement (P\u2009=\u2009.006), Alienation (P\u2009<\u2009.001), Stigma Resistance (P\u2009=\u2009.004), Secrecy (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and Recovery Assessment Scale (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.22 to 0.46 for baseline to post-intervention changes. Baseline and 30-day follow-up assessments did not significantly differ. Conclusions: A 2-minute social contact-based video intervention effectively yielded an immediate but not a lasting decrease in self-stigma among young individuals with ongoing mental health conditions. This is the first study to examine the effect of a video intervention on self-stigma. Future trials of self-stigma treatment interventions should explore whether combining existing interventions with brief videos enhances intervention effects.

We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Even when active-comparator trials exist, they might not produce meaningful data to inform decisions in clinical practice and health policy. The uncertainty associated with the paucity of well designed active-comparator trials has been compounded by legal and regulatory changes in Europe and the USA that have created a complex mix of expedited programmes aimed at facilitating faster access to new drugs. Comparative evidence generation is even sparser for medical devices. Some have argued that the current process for regulatory approval needs to generate more evidence that is useful for patients, clinicians, and payers in health-care systems. We propose a set of five key principles relevant to the European Medicines Agency, European medical device regulatory agencies, US Food and Drug Administration, as well as payers, that we believe will provide the necessary incentives for pharmaceutical and device companies to generate comparative data on drugs and devices and assure timely availability of evidence that is useful for decision making. First, labelling should routinely inform patients and clinicians whether comparative data exist on new products. Second, regulators should be more selective in their use of programmes that facilitate drug and device approvals on the basis of incomplete benefit and harm data. Third, regulators should encourage the conduct of randomised trials with active comparators. Fourth, regulators should use prospectively designed network meta-analyses based on existing and future randomised trials. Last, payers should use their policy levers and negotiating power to incentivise the generation of comparative evidence on new and existing drugs and devices, for example, by explicitly considering proven added benefit in pricing and payment decisions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers, Pharmacological", "Device Approval", "Drug Approval", "Drug Tolerance", "Equipment Safety", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Safety", "United States", "United States Food and Drug Administration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huseyin", "Last Name": "Naci", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK.

At present, available treatments offer only minimal to moderate benefits to ameliorate cognitive deficits. Thus, there remains an urgent need to identify novel interventions to improve cognition in people with SZ. Emerging evidence from animal and basic human research suggests aerobic exercise training (AE) has beneficial effects on cognition. Preliminary findings suggest that AE is efficacious in improving cognitive functioning in SZ, however the extant studies have been limited by small samples, a dearth of information on biologically-relevant covariates, and limited information on impact on daily functioning. Additionally, while AE-related cognitive benefits have been linked to Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) upregulation, this putative mechanism needs confirmation. The present report describes a study protocol designed to address these limitations-we review and summarize the current literature on treatment of cognitive deficits in SZ, state the rationale for employing AE to target these deficits, and describe the current protocol-a multi-site, single-blind, randomized clinical trial aiming to recruit 200 community-dwelling individuals with SZ. Participants are randomized to one of two 12-week interventions: AE using active-play video games (i.e., Xbox Kinect) and traditional cardiovascular exercise equipment or a stretching-and-toning (ST) control intervention. Participants undergo assessments of aerobic fitness, cognition, and daily functioning, as well as BDNF and other biomarkers of cognitive change, at baseline and after 6-and 12-weeks.", "Keywords": ["BDNF", "aerobic exercise", "aerobic fitness", "cognition", "functioning", "inflammation", "neuroplasticity", "neurotrophins", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luz H", "Last Name": "Ospina", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lars F", "Last Name": "Jarskog", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob S", "Last Name": "Ballon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "McEvoy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew N", "Last Name": "Bartels", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Buchsbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "T Scott", "Last Name": "Stroup", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kimhy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of psychiatry and brain science", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31378553", "Title": "Examination of heterogeneity in treatment response to antipsychotic medications.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Deprescriptions", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Olanzapine", "Perphenazine", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Psychotic Disorders", "Quetiapine Fumarate", "Risperidone", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Bareis", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA.

"30192094", "Title": "Management of common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications.", "Abstract": "The benefits of antipsychotic medications are sometimes obscured by their adverse effects. These effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues (e.g., mild sedation or dry mouth) to very unpleasant (e.g., constipation, akathisia, sexual dysfunction) to painful (e.g., acute dystonias) to disfiguring (e.g., weight gain, tardive dyskinesia) to life-threatening (e.g., myocarditis, agranulocytosis). Importantly, adverse effect profiles are specific to each antipsychotic medication and do not neatly fit into first- and second-generation classifications. This paper reviews management strategies for the most frequent side effects and identifies common principles intended to optimize net antipsychotic benefits. Only use antipsychotics if the indication is clear; only continue antipsychotics if a benefit is discernible. If an antipsychotic is providing substantial benefit, and the adverse effect is not life-threatening, then the first management choice is to lower the dose or adjust the dosing schedule. The next option is to change the antipsychotic; this is often reasonable unless the risk of relapse is high. In some instances, behavioral interventions can be tried. Finally, concomitant medications, though generally not desirable, are necessary in many instances and can provide considerable relief. Among concomitant medication strategies, anticholinergic medications for dystonias and parkinsonism are often effective; beta-blockers and anticholinergic medications are useful for akathisia; and metformin may lead to slight to moderate weight loss. Anticholinergic drops applied sublingually reduce sialorrhea. Usual medications are effective for constipation or dyslipidemias. The clinical utility of recently approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, is unclear.", "Keywords": ["Antipsychotics", "adverse effects", "agranulocytosis", "akathisia", "dystonias", "impulse control disorders", "metabolic effects", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome", "orthostatic hypotension", "parkinsonism", "schizophrenia", "sedation", "sexual function", "sialorrhea", "tardive dyskinesia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "T Scott", "Last Name": "Stroup", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, John A.

However, genome-wide investigation of the contribution of CNV to risk has been hampered by limited sample sizes.

A global enrichment of CNV burden was observed in cases (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 5.7 \u00d7 10-15), which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR = 1.07, P = 1.7 \u00d7 10-6). CNV burden was enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8 \u00d7 10-11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P = 7.3 \u00d7 10-5). Genome-wide significant evidence was obtained for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2.

Aerobic exercise (AE) has emerged as a potential intervention. This review examines the impact of AE on brain structure and function along with neurocognitive performance in individuals with schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence indicates that AE can increase hippocampal volume and cortical thickness, in addition to exerting a neuroprotective effect against hippocampal volume decrease and cortical thinning. There is also evidence that AE is able to significantly increase serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, which are implicated in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and cognitive improvement. Finally, evidence suggests that AE plays a significant role in improving overall cognition, including improvements in processing speed, working memory, and visual learning. The authors discuss the implications of the findings and provide recommendations for future research and areas of inquiry.", "Keywords": ["Aerobic exercise", "Aerobic fitness", "BDNF", "Brain structure", "Cognition", "Hippocampal volume", "Neuroplasticity", "Neurotrophins", "Schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Vakhrusheva", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry Westchester Division, Weill Cornell Medical College, Outpatient Department, 21 Bloomingdale Road, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brielle", "Last Name": "Marino", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry Westchester Division, Weill Cornell Medical College, Outpatient Department, 21 Bloomingdale Road, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."}, {"First Name": "T Scott", "Last Name": "Stroup", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kimhy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Current behavioral neuroscience reports", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}, {"PMID": "27247177", "Title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate Versus Haloperidol Decanoate in Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This study assessed the relative cost-effectiveness of haloperidol decanoate (HD), a first-generation long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic, and paliperidone palmitate (PP), a second-generation LAI antipsychotic.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Haloperidol", "Humans", "Injections", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Paliperidone Palmitate", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Psychotic Disorders", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Schizophrenia", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Rosenheck", "Affiliation": "Dr. Rosenheck is with the Department of Psychiatry, Yale Medical School, New Haven, Connecticut, and with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs New England Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center, West Haven (e-mail: robert.rosenheck@yale.edu ).

We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 \u00b1 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 \u00b1 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease.
