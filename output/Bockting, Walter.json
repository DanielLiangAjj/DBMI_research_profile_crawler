However, most transgender-health studies have focused on convenience samples with limited generalizability. This study utilized data from the 2016-2018 TransPop Study, the first national probability sample of transgender adults (n=274) with a cisgender comparison sample (n=1162). Using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for demographics, we compared the prevalence of hazardous drinking, problematic drug use, serious psychological distress, suicidality, and non-suicidal self-injury between transgender and cisgender individuals and among transgender men (n=78), transgender women (n=120), and transgender nonbinary individuals (n=76). Among transgender individuals, 28.2% (95%CI 21.2-35.2) and 31.2% (95%CI 23.8-38.7) reported hazardous drinking and problematic drug use, respectively; 44.4% (95% CI 35.8-53.0) reported recent suicidal ideation, 6.9% (95% CI 2.3-11.5) reported a recent suicide attempt, and 21.4% (95% CI 14.5%-28.4%) reported recent non-suicidal self-injury. In their lifetime, 81.3% (95%CI 75.1-87.5) of transgender respondents had suicidal ideation, 42.0% (95%CI 34.2-49.8) had attempted suicide, and 56.0% (95% CI 48.2-63.8) reported non-suicidal self-injury. Most (81.5%; 95%CI 75.5-87.5) had utilized formal mental health care and 25.5% (95%CI 18.5-32.4) had sought informal mental health support. There were no differences in alcohol or drug-use outcomes between transgender and cisgender adults. Compared to cisgender adults, transgender adults had higher odds of serious psychological distress (aOR=3.1; 95%CI 1.7-5.7), suicidal ideation (recent: aOR=5.1, 95%CI 2.7-9.6); lifetime: aOR=6.7, 95%CI 3.8-11.7), lifetime suicide attempts (aOR=4.4, 95%CI 2.4-8.0), and non-suicidal self-injury (recent: aOR=13.0, 95%CI 4.8-35.1); lifetime: aOR=7.6, 95%CI 4.1-14.3). Transgender nonbinary adults had the highest odds for all outcomes, including substance use outcomes.

While there is mounting evidence of gender-based stigma and discrimination in healthcare, little is known about how TGNB individuals develop positive patient-provider relationships. Aims: To examine TGNB individuals' interactions with healthcare providers and identify main characteristics of positive patient-providers relationships. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 TGNB individuals in New York, NY. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed inductively for themes related to characteristics of positive and trusting relationships with healthcare providers. Results: Participants' mean age was 30\u2009years (IQR = 13\u2009years) and most participants were nonwhite (n\u2009=\u200912, 92%). Receiving peer referrals to specific clinics or providers helped many participants find providers perceived to be competent and created initial grounds for positive patient-provider relationships. Providers with whom participants had positive relationships commonly managed primary care and gender-affirming care and relied on a network of interdisciplinary providers for other specialized care. Providers who were positively evaluated were perceived to possess in-depth clinical knowledge on the issues they were responsible for managing, including gender-affirming interventions, particularly for TGNB patients who perceived themselves to be knowledgeable about TGNB-specific care. Provider and staff cultural competence and a TGNB-affirming clinic environment were also important, particularly early in the patient-provider relationship, and if combined with TGNB clinical competence. Discussion: Provider-focused training and education programs should combine components of TGNB clinical and cultural competence to facilitate development of positive relationships between TGNB patients and providers, thereby improving the health and wellbeing of TGNB people.", "Keywords": ["Gender identity", "patient satisfaction", "patient-provider relationships", "qualitative research",

Many transgender adolescents experience gender dysphoria related to incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth. This dysphoria may worsen as puberty progresses. Puberty suppression by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), such as leuprolide, can help alleviate gender dysphoria and provide additional time before irreversible changes in secondary sex characteristics may be initiated through feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy congruent with the adolescent's gender experience. However, the effects of GnRH agonists on brain function and mental health are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of leuprolide on reproductive function, social and affective behavior, cognition, and brain activity in a rodent model. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were injected daily with saline or leuprolide (20\u2009\u03bcg) for 6 weeks and tested in several behavioral assays. We found that leuprolide increases hyperlocomotion, changes social preference, and increases neuroendocrine stress responses in male mice, while the same treatment increases hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. Neuronal hyperactivity was found in the dentate gyrus (DG) of leuprolide-treated females, but not males, consistent with the elevation in hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. These data show for the first time that GnRH agonist treatment after puberty onset exerts sex-specific effects on social- and affective behavior, stress regulation, and neural activity. Investigating the behavioral and neurobiological effects of GnRH agonists in mice will be important to better guide the investigation of potential consequences of this treatment for youth experiencing gender dysphoria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Female", "Gender Identity", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Puberty", "Transgender Persons", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

Parental support is a recognized adolescent protective factor; however, little is known about the specific parental behaviors that trans adolescents perceive as most or least supportive. To address this gap, we analyzed data from qualitative interviews conducted with an ethnically diverse, urban-based sample of trans adolescents (N = 24; 16-20 years old) to describe (a) the spectrum of specific parental behaviors across 3 categories-rejecting, supportive, and mixed (i.e., simultaneous supportive and rejecting behaviors)-and (b) the perceived psychosocial consequences across these 3 categories of parental behaviors. Qualitative data were gathered through lifeline interviews (i.e., visual representations from birth to present) and photo elicitation (i.e., photographs representing parental support and/or rejection). Supportive behaviors included instances where parents made independent efforts to learn about trans issues or help their child obtain gender-affirming health care. Rejecting behaviors included instances when parents refused to use their child's name or pronouns or failed to show empathy when their child struggled with gender-identity-related challenges. Mixed behaviors included examples when parents expressed support of their child's gender identity, but not of their sexual orientation (or vice versa). Overall, participants reported that rejecting and mixed parental behaviors contributed to a range of psychosocial problems (e.g., depression and suicidal ideation), while supportive behaviors increased positive wellbeing. These findings expand upon descriptions of parental support and rejection within the trans adolescent literature and can help practitioners target specific behaviors for interventions.

Methods: An item pool was created based on responses from a small clinical sample (N\u2009=\u200912) to an open-ended questionnaire. Expert judges reviewed the items, resulting in a 60-item instrument for empirical testing. We conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) by using a community sample of 430 transgender individuals (aged 18-72, mean [M]\u2009=\u200937.4, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200912.0), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by using an online sample of 903 transgender individuals (aged 18-66, M\u2009=\u200931.6, SD\u2009=\u200911.1). Construct validity was examined by using correlations with instruments assessing related constructs administered to the online sample. Results: EFA resulted in a 52-item instrument with four subscales: Pride, Passing, Alienation, and Shame. CFA, after removal of half of the items, retained the four-factor structure. The final 26-item scale showed excellent internal consistency (0.90) and test-retest reliability (0.93). The factors showed a pattern of association with crossgender identity, gender ideology, outness, felt stigma, self-esteem, and psychological distress consistent with moderate-to-good construct validity. Conclusion: Internalized transphobia can be conceptualized as four inter-related dimensions: pride in transgender identity (reverse scored), investment in passing as a cisgender person, alienation from other transgender people, and shame. The Transgender Identity Survey reliably assesses this construct, useful in research to understand the impact of minority stress on transgender people's health.

In studies of other biomedical HIV prevention products (e.g., oral PrEP) it is clear that transgender women have unique concerns related to the use of these strategies.

Findings showed that participants were overwhelmingly positive about long-acting HIV prevention strategies, though they had some apprehensions. Overall, participants felt that injections and IMDDs could help address adherence challenges, and that transgender-specific needs should be addressed during clinical trials. Also, there were concerns related to injection or IMDD logistics, concerns about injections' or IMDDs' presence in the body, and familiarity with these products affected participants' opinions on them.

The study contributes to a better understanding of barriers and facilitators to uptake and adherence for FSW and WWID around both existing and new PrEP modalities, with implications for future clinical trials and PrEP interventions with at risk-populations.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "Modes of delivery", "PrEP", "female injection drug user", "female sex worker"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Baltimore", "Condoms", "Drug Users", "Female", "Focus Groups", "HIV Infections", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Medication Adherence", "Needle Sharing", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Factors", "Safe Sex", "Sex Workers", "Sexual Partners", "Substance Abuse, Intravenous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine H A", "Last Name": "Footer", "Affiliation": "a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA."}, {"First Name": "Sahnah", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "b Department of Population Health, NYU School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine Tagliaferri", "Last Name": "Rael", "Affiliation": "c HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, New\u00a0York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New\u00a0York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "George J", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "d Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University , Chicago , IL , USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Carballa-Di\u00e9guez", "Affiliation": "c HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, New\u00a0York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New\u00a0York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Giguere", "Affiliation": "c HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, New\u00a0York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University , New\u00a0York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "e Program for the Study of LGBT Health, New\u00a0York State Psychiatric Institute / Columbia Psychiatry with the Columbia University School of Nursing , New\u00a0York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Bockting", "Affiliation": "e Program for the Study of LGBT Health, New\u00a0York State Psychiatric Institute / Columbia Psychiatry with the Columbia University School of Nursing , New\u00a0York , NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "D'Aquila", "Affiliation": "d Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University , Chicago , IL , USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan G", "Last Name": "Sherman", "Affiliation": "a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA."}], "Journal": "AIDS care", "PubDate": "2019Oct"}, {"PMID": "30601189", "Title": "Nurse Documentation of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Home Healthcare: A Text Mining Study.", "Abstract": "Health disparities have been documented in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population, but more research is needed to better understand how to address them.

Qualitative interviews were conducted with transmasculine spectrum people (N = 18) who reported a history of NSSI. Their mean age was 24.9 years old (SD = 5.43, range = 17-38). Participants reported that NSSI was influenced by a variety of factors including stress from gender nonconformity in childhood and adolescence. Stigma related to minority status and identity as well as proximal minority stress processes of concealment and expectations of rejection were identified as contributing to NSSI. Transgender identity development tasks such as coming out and identity exploration also appeared to affect NSSI. Finding a community of peers who engage in NSSI was helpful in mitigating social isolation, but at times reinforced NSSI. We discuss clinical implications at the individual and family levels.

The authors conducted a secondary analysis of data that included 680 transgender women (M age\u00a0=\u00a032.63, SD age\u00a0=\u00a012.29) and 530 transgender men (M age\u00a0=\u00a026.14, SD age\u00a0=\u00a07.42).

Overall, 21.5% of participants reported excessive alcohol use; no significant differences were found on the rates of excessive alcohol use between transgender women and men. Cannabis use among our sample was 24.4%; trangender men reported significantly higher rates of cannabis use compared to transgender women. Illicit drug (noncannabis) use among our sample was 11.6%; transgender men also reported significantly higher rates of illicit drug use compared to transgender women. Multivariate analyses suggested that gender dysphoria was significantly associated with: excessive alcohol use for transgender women, cannabis use among both transgender women and men, and illicit (noncannabis) drug use among transgender women. A nonheterosexual orientation was associated with increased odds of cannabis use among transgender women and men; a nonheterosexual orientation was associated with greater odds of illicit substance use among transgender men but not among transgender women. Gender\u00a0minority stressors were independently associated with excessive alcohol use among transgender men and cannabis use among transgender women.

Ethical Issues Related to Using Computational Methods to Discover Non-Disclosed Patient Characteristics.", "Abstract": "Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of \"big data\" mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report's principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician's biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.", "Keywords": ["LGBT; informed consent", "LGBTQ", "and burdens of research/beneficence and non-maleficence", "benefits", "clinical settings", "data mining", "data sharing", "electronic health record", "other clinical", "risks"], "MeSH terms": ["Beneficence", "Data Collection", "Disclosure", "Electronic Health Records", "Electronics", "Humans", "Information Dissemination", "Informed Consent", "Personal Autonomy", "Personhood", "Phenotype", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Privacy", "Social Justice", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Transgender Persons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenrick D", "Last Name": "Cato", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA kdc2110@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Bockting", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Larson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of empirical research on human research ethics : JERHRE", "PubDate": "2016Jul"}, {"PMID": "27272643", "Title": "Nonsuicidal self-injury among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations: an integrative review.", "Abstract": "To conduct an integrative review of nonsuicidal self-injury among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations to better understand the prevalence; to identify the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender subgroups at increased risk for nonsuicidal self-injury; and to examine the risk factors associated with nonsuicidal self-injury among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations.", "Keywords": ["bisexual", "gay", "integrative review", "lesbian", "mental health", "nonsuicidal self-injury", "sexual and gender minorities", "transgender"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Gender Identity", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Sexual and Gender Minorities"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kate", "Last Name": "Jackman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University School of Nursing, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judy", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Columbia University School of Nursing, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Bockting", "Affiliation": "Division of Gender, Sexuality, & Health, New York State Psychiatric Institute / Columbia Psychiatry and the Columbia University School of Nursing, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical nursing", "PubDate": "2016Dec"}, {"PMID": "27238062", "Title": "Vulnerability and Resilience Among Gender-Nonconforming Children and Adolescents: Mental Health Professionals Have a Key Role to Play.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Gender Identity", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Resilience, Psychological", "Transgender Persons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Walter O", "Last Name": "Bockting", "Affiliation": "Program for the Study of LGBT Health, Division of Gender, Sexuality, and Health, New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI)/Columbia Psychiatry and the Columbia University School of Nursing, New York.

These approaches each have pros and cons, and raise ethical, legal, and logistical questions, given that ethical tensions can emerge between preserving the integrity of research vs. protecting the privacy and confidentiality of study respondents.

To help researchers with the challenging task of identifying appropriate measures for studies in sexual-minority health, we reviewed measures of homophobia published in the academic literature from 1970 to 2012. Instruments that measured attitudes toward male homosexuals/homosexuality or measured homosexuals' internalized attitudes toward homosexuality were identified using measurement manuals and a systematic review. A total of 23 instruments met criteria for inclusion, and their features were summarized and compared. All 23 instruments met minimal criteria for adequate scale construction, including scale development, sampling, reliability, and evidence of validity. Validity evidence was diverse and was categorized as interaction with gay men, HIV/AIDS variables, mental health, and conservative religious or political beliefs.
