[{"PMID": "38895424", "Title": "Ephrin Forward Signaling Controls Interspecies Cell Competition in Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "Abstract": "In the animal kingdom, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms known as cell competition eliminate unfit cells during development. Interestingly, cell competition also leads to apoptosis of donor cells upon direct contact with host cells from a different species during interspecies chimera formation. The mechanisms underlying how host animal cells recognize and transmit cell death signals to adjacent xenogeneic human cells remain incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an interspecies cell contact reporter system to dissect the mechanisms underlying competitive interactions between mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Through single-cell RNA-seq analyses, we discovered that Ephrin A ligands in mouse cells play a crucial role in signaling cell death to adjacent human cells that express EPHA receptors during interspecies PSC co-culture. We also demonstrated that blocking the Ephrin A-EPHA receptor interaction pharmacologically, and inhibiting Ephrin forward signaling genetically in the mouse cells, enhances the survival of human PSCs and promotes chimera formation both in vitro and in vivo . Our findings elucidate key mechanisms of interspecies PSC competition during early embryogenesis and open new avenues for generating humanized tissues or organs in animals, potentially revolutionizing regenerative medicine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junichi", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuri", "Last Name": "Kondo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Sakurai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anri", "Last Name": "Sawada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youngmin", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Akihiro", "Last Name": "Miura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuko", "Last Name": "Shimamura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dai", "Last Name": "Shimizu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yingying", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hemanta", "Last Name": "Sarmah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zurab", "Last Name": "Ninish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Munemasa", "Last Name": "Mori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun03"}, {"PMID": "38865239", "Title": "Generation of salivary glands derived from pluripotent stem cells via conditional blastocyst complementation.", "Abstract": "Whole salivary gland generation and transplantation offer potential therapies for salivary gland dysfunction.

Foxa2 promoter-driven, conditional Fgfr2 gene depletion caused the lung and thymus agenesis phenotype in mice. Wild-type donor mouse PSCs injected into their blastocysts rescued this phenotype by complementing the Fgfr2-defective niche in the lung epithelium and mesenchyme and thymic epithelium. Donor cell is shown to replace the entire lung epithelial and robust mesenchymal niche during lung development, efficiently complementing the nearly entire lung niche.

Generation of multiple cilia requires both activation of a specialized transcriptional program and subsequent massive amplification of centrioles within the cytoplasm. The E2F4 transcription factor is required for both roles and consequently for multiciliogenesis. Here we establish that E2F4 associates with two distinct components of the centriole replication machinery, Deup1 and SAS6, targeting nonhomologous domains in these proteins. We map Deup1 and SAS6 binding to E2F4's N-terminus and show that this domain is sufficient to mediate E2F4's cytoplasmic role in multiciliogenesis. This sequence is highly conserved across the E2F family, but the ability to bind Deup1 and SAS6 is specific to E2F4 and E2F5, consistent with their shared roles in multiciliogenesis. By generating E2F4/E2F1 chimeras, we identify a six-residue motif that is critical for Deup1 and SAS6 binding.

We show that when epithelial tubules are forming and branching, a nucleocytoplasmic shift in Yap localization marks the boundary between the airway and the distal lung compartments. At this transition zone, Yap specifies a transcriptional program that controls Sox2 expression and ultimately generates the airway epithelium. Without Yap, epithelial progenitors are unable to properly respond to local TGF-\u03b2-induced cues and control levels and distribution of Sox2 to form airways. Yap levels and subcellular localization also markedly influence Sox2 expression and differentiation of adult airway progenitors.

Obesity causes central leptin resistance. However, whether enhanced peripheral leptin sensitivity could overcome central leptin resistance remains obscure. A peripheral metabolic organ targeted by leptin is the liver, with low Leprb expression. We here show that mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and obese patients with hepatosteatosis exhibit increased expression of hepatic helicase with zinc finger 2, a transcriptional coactivator (Helz2), which functions as a transcriptional coregulator of several nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 in vitro. To explore the physiological importance of Helz2, we generated Helz2-deficient mice and analyzed their metabolic phenotypes. Helz2-deficient mice showing hyperleptinemia associated with central leptin resistance were protected against HFD-induced obesity and had significantly up-regulated hepatic Leprb expression. Helz2 deficiency and adenovirus-mediated liver-specific exogenous Leprb overexpression in wild-type mice significantly stimulated hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase on HFD, whereas Helz2-deficient db/db mice lacking functional Leprb did not. Fatty acid-\u03b2 oxidation was increased in Helz2-deficeint hepatocytes, and Helz2-deficient mice revealed increased oxygen consumption and decreased respiratory quotient in calorimetry analyses. The enhanced hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase energy-sensing pathway in Helz2-deficient mice ameliorated hyperlipidemia, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance by reducing lipogenic gene expression and stimulating lipid-burning gene expression in the liver. These findings together demonstrate that Helz2 deficiency ameliorates HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities by stimulating endogenous hepatic Leprb expression, despite central leptin resistance. Hepatic HELZ2 might be a novel target molecule for the treatment of obesity with hepatosteatosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Animals", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Leptin", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Obesity", "RNA Helicases", "Receptors, Leptin", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Yoshino", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and Molecular Science (S.Y., T.Sat., M.Y., K.H., T.To., A.K.-T., S.K., S.O., H.S., A.O., T.Tu., Ma.Mori) and Human Pathology (H.I., Y.N.), Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, 371-8511 Japan; Laboratory of Biosignal Sciences (Mu.Mori, T.Ma.) and Metabolic Signal Research Center, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation (T.Sas., T.K.), Gunma University, Maebashi, 371-8512 Japan; and Kitakanto Molecular Novel Research Institute for Obesity and Metabolism (Ma.Mori), Midori, 379-2311 Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tetsurou", "Last Name": "Satoh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masanobu", "Last Name": "Yamada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Koshi", "Last Name": "Hashimoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takuya", "Last Name": "Tomaru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Akiko", "Last Name": "Katano-Toki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Satoru", "Last Name": "Kakizaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shuichi", "Last Name": "Okada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroyuki", "Last Name": "Shimizu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Atsushi", "Last Name": "Ozawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takafumi", "Last Name": "Tuchiya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hayato", "Last Name": "Ikota", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yoichi", "Last Name": "Nakazato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Munemasa", "Last Name": "Mori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Matozaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tsutomu", "Last Name": "Sasaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tadahiro", "Last Name": "Kitamura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masatomo", "Last Name": "Mori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Endocrinology", "PubDate": "2014Sep"}, {"PMID": "24451369", "Title": "Shear stress-induced redistribution of vascular endothelial-protein-tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) in endothelial cells and its role in cell elongation.", "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are continuously exposed to shear stress (SS) generated by blood flow. Such stress plays a key role in regulation of various aspects of EC function including cell proliferation and motility as well as changes in cell morphology. Vascular endothelial-protein-tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) is an R3-subtype PTP that possesses multiple fibronectin type III-like domains in its extracellular region and is expressed specifically in ECs. The role of VE-PTP in EC responses to SS has remained unknown, however. Here we show that VE-PTP is diffusely localized in ECs maintained under static culture conditions, whereas it undergoes rapid accumulation at the downstream edge of the cells relative to the direction of flow in response to SS. This redistribution of VE-PTP triggered by SS was found to require its extracellular and transmembrane regions and was promoted by integrin engagement of extracellular matrix ligands. Inhibition of actin polymerization or of Cdc42, Rab5, or Arf6 activities attenuated the SS-induced redistribution of VE-PTP. VE-PTP also underwent endocytosis in the static and SS conditions. SS induced the polarized distribution of internalized VE-PTP. Such an effect was promoted by integrin engagement of fibronectin but prevented by inhibition of Cdc42 activity or of actin polymerization. In addition, depletion of VE-PTP by RNA interference in human umbilical vein ECs blocked cell elongation in the direction of flow induced by SS. Our results suggest that the polarized redistribution of VE-PTP in response to SS plays an important role in the regulation of EC function by blood flow.", "Keywords": ["Endothelial Cell", "Membrane Proteins", "Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase (Tyrosine Phosphatase)", "Shear Stress", "Small GTPases"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Animals", "Blood Circulation", "Cell Enlargement", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytoskeleton", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "RNA Interference", "Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3", "Shear Strength", "Stress, Mechanical", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kemala Isnainiasih", "Last Name": "Mantilidewi", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-0017, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yoji", "Last Name": "Murata", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.
