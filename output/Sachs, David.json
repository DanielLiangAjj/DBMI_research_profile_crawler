Motivated by experimental observations and by consideration of its composition, a quadriphasic model of the dermis is proposed, distinguishing solid matrix components, interstitial fluid and charged constituents moving within the fluid, i.e., anions and cations. Compression and tensile experiments with and without change of osmolarity of the bath are performed to characterize the chemo-mechanical coupling in the dermis. Model parameters are determined through inverse analysis. The computations predict a dominant role of the permeability in the determination of the temporal evolution of the mechanical response of the tissue. In line with the previous studies on other tissues, the analysis shows that an ideal model based on Donnan's equilibrium overestimates the osmotic pressure in skin for the case of very dilute solutions. The quadriphasic model is applied to predict changes in dermal cell environment and therefore alterations in what is called the \"mechanome,\" associated with skin stretch. The simulations indicate that skin deformation causes a variation in several local variables, including in particular the electric field associated with a deformation-induced non-homogeneous distribution of fixed charges.", "Keywords": ["Dermis", "Electrical potential", "Mechanobiology", "Osmotic pressure", "Quadriphasic model"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Institute for Mechanical Systems, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland. sachs@imes.mavt.ethz.ch."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Jakob", "Affiliation": "Institute for Mechanical Systems, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Gaetana", "Last Name": "Restivo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "J\u00fcrg", "Last Name": "Hafner", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Lindenblatt", "Affiliation": "Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, University Hospital Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Alexander E", "Last Name": "Ehret", "Affiliation": "Institute for Mechanical Systems, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Edoardo", "Last Name": "Mazza", "Affiliation": "Institute for Mechanical Systems, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland. mazza@imes.mavt.ethz.ch."}], "Journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "PubDate": "2024Mar15"}, {"PMID": "38465797", "Title": "Xenotransplantation at 30 years - A personal reminiscence and some thoughts for the future.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Transplantation, Heterologous", "Memory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Departments of Surgery and Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Xenotransplantation", "PubDate": "2024Mar-Apr"}, {"PMID": "38452918", "Title": "Enhancing Kidney Transplantation and the Role of Xenografts: Report of a Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.", "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 37 million people in the United States; of these,>800,000 have end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Despite efforts to increase the donor kidney supply, approximately 100,000 people are registered on the kidney transplant wait-list with no measurable decrease over the past 2 decades. The outcomes of kidney transplantation are significantly better than for chronic dialysis: kidney transplant recipients have lower rates of mortality and cardiovascular events and better quality of life, but wait-list time matters. Time on dialysis waiting for a deceased-donor kidney is a strong independent risk factor for outcomes after a kidney transplant. Deceased-donor recipients with wait-list times on dialysis of<6 months have graft survival rates equivalent to living-donor recipients with waitlist times on dialysis of>2 years.

As the gap between the demand for and availability of donor kidneys for allotransplantation continues to widen, alternative strategies are needed to provide a stable, sufficient, and timely supply.

Recently approved microsampling devices address some of these issues but remain cost-prohibitive for resource-limited settings. In this work, a cost-effective microsampling device is described for the collection of liquid blood with minimal invasiveness and sufficient volume retrieval for laboratory analyses or immediate point-of-care testing. Inspired by the anatomy of sanguivorous leeches, the single-use device features a storage compartment for blood collection and a microneedle patch hidden within a suction cup. Finite Element Method simulations, corroborated by mechanical analyses, guide the material selection for device fabrication and design optimization. In piglets, the device successfully collects \u2248195\u00a0\u00b5L of blood with minimal invasiveness. Additionally, a tailor-made lid and adapter enable safe fluid transportation and integration with commercially available point-of-care systems for on-site analyses, respectively. Taken together, the proposed platform holds significant promise for enhancing healthcare in the pediatric population by improving patient compliance and reducing the risk of needlestick injuries through concealed microneedles.

A comparison with numerical simulations indicates that the measured increase in skin stiffness is far below the level expected for the corresponding deformation of abdominal skin. A new set of simulations accounting for growth could rationalize all observations. The predicted amount of tissue growth corresponds to approximately 40% area increase before delivery. The results of the simulations also offered the opportunity to investigate the biophysical cues present in abdominal skin along gestation and to compare them with those arising in skin expanders.

We examine the effect of various diameters of the ring-shaped culture insert on the HSE's characteristics and compare them to state-of-the-art unconstrained and planar constrained HSEs. We show that radial matrix constraint of HSEs regulates tissue contraction, promotes fibroblast and matrix organization that is similar to human skin in vivo and improves keratinocyte differentiation, epidermal stratification, and basement membrane formation depending on the culture insert diameter.

In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed on a compassionate use basis, and xenotransplantation experiments using pig kidneys in deceased human recipients provided encouraging data. Many advances in xenotransplantation have resulted from improvements in the ability to genetically modify pigs using CRISPR-Cas9 and other methodologies. Gene editing has the capacity to generate pig organs that more closely resemble those of humans and are hence more physiologically compatible and less prone to rejection. Despite such modifications, immune responses to xenografts remain powerful and multi-faceted, involving innate immune components that do not attack allografts.

Research reveals behavioral differences between adults ready to discontinue tobacco use and those who are not. Thus, the interventions applied to these populations might differ. However, the evidence of using varenicline in individuals who are not ready to discontinue tobacco use is uncertain. Objectives: To determine if, in tobacco-dependent adults who report not being ready to discontinue tobacco use, clinicians should begin treatment with varenicline or wait until subjects are ready to discontinue tobacco use. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of treatment with varenicline in tobacco-dependent adults who are not ready to discontinue tobacco use. We systematically searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify randomized controlled trials comparing varenicline versus placebo for individuals who were not ready to discontinue tobacco use. Outcomes of interest include point prevalence abstinence during treatment or at six months or longer, smoking reduction, motivation to quit, adverse events, and withdrawal symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed eligibility and risk of bias using a standardized data collection form. We followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Results: Five trials met our inclusion criteria. All 2,616 participants were adults who were not ready to discontinue tobacco use at study entry. For 7-day point prevalence abstinence at six months or longer, high-certainty evidence suggested that varenicline increased abstinence compared with placebo (relative risk, 2.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.70-2.35]; absolute risk reduction, 173 more per 1,000 [95% CI, 121 more to 234 more]). We identified moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that varenicline increased serious adverse events (relative risk, 1.75 [95% CI, 0.98-3.13]; absolute risk reduction, 12 more per 1,000 [95% CI, 0 fewer to 35 more]). For withdrawal, low-certainty evidence suggested that varenicline treatment was associated with a lower symptom score (mean difference, 1.54 points lower; 95% CI, 2.15-0.93 points lower; low certainty) assessed using the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges.

Here, we induce efficient human PSC-CM (hPSC-CM) maturation through metabolic-pathway modulations. Specifically, we find that peroxisome-proliferator-associated receptor (PPAR) signaling regulates glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in an isoform-specific manner. While PPARalpha (PPARa) is the most active isoform in hPSC-CMs, PPARdelta (PPARd) activation efficiently upregulates the gene regulatory networks underlying FAO, increases mitochondrial and peroxisome content, enhances mitochondrial cristae formation, and augments FAO flux. PPARd activation further increases binucleation, enhances myofibril organization, and improves contractility. Transient lactate exposure, which is frequently used for hPSC-CM purification, induces an independent cardiac maturation program but, when combined with PPARd activation, still enhances oxidative metabolism. In summary, we investigate multiple metabolic modifications in hPSC-CMs and identify a role for PPARd signaling in inducing the metabolic switch from glycolysis to FAO in hPSC-CMs.", "Keywords": ["PPAR signaling", "cardiac maturation", "fatty acid oxidation", "metabolism", "stem cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "PPAR delta", "Pluripotent Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nadeera M", "Last Name": "Wickramasinghe", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell, Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA;

We conducted an interview study with 14 active and 3 inactive participants of a community-based Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors (TIPS) to examine older individuals' perceived benefits and barriers to participating in community-based telehealth programs as well as strategies to improve those programs. We found that older adults had a positive experience toward the use of telehealth services in a community setting, including benefits like monitoring health status and enabling socialization. There were no perceived barriers about the telehealth program. Aspects that can be improved include facilitating the management and sharing of historical physiological data, providing additional assessments of cognitive and/or mental status, supporting self-education, and enabling more comprehensive health status tracking.

Motivated by skin's histology, a biphasic model is proposed which differentiates between epidermis, papillary and reticular dermis, and hypodermis. Inverse analysis of ex vivo tensile and in vivo suction experiments yields mechanical parameters for each layer and predicts a stiff reticular dermis and successively softer papillary dermis, epidermis and hypodermis. Layer-specific analysis of simulations underlines the dominating role of the reticular dermis in tensile loading.

In in vivo suction experiments, the softer upper layers strongly influence the mechanical response, whose dissipative part is determined by interstitial fluid redistribution within the tissue.

Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks.

With recent progress in xenotransplantation permitting porcine organ graft survival of months or even years in nonhuman primates, there is renewed interest in its potential to alleviate the organ shortage. Many of these advances are the result of our heightened capacity to modify pigs genetically, particularly with the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing methodologies. Although this approach allows the engineering of pig organs that are less prone to rejection, the clinical application of xenotransplantation will require the ability to avoid the ravages of a multifaceted attack on the immune system while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. In this review, we will discuss the potential and limitations of these modifications and how the engineering of the graft can be leveraged to alter the host immune response so that all types of immune attack are avoided.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Organ Transplantation", "Swine", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, USA. megan.sykes@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Science immunology", "PubDate": "2019Nov01"}, {"PMID": "31630416", "Title": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of a clinically effective anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody.", "Abstract": "The humanized IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody siplizumab and its rat parent monoclonal IgG2b antibody BTI-322 are directed against the CD2 antigen.

Experimental samples and control samples, consisting of pre-transplant porcine and baboon serum and plasma, were analyzed for standard lipid profiles and for amino acid levels. Lipid profiles of LXT recipients remained stable following xenotransplantation compared to donor porcine baseline levels. Amino acid concentrations also remained similar to baseline controls, with the exception of a 3-fold increase in l-ornithine and more than a 10-fold decrease in l-arginine post-transplant when compared to both porcine and baboon baseline levels. The observed changes in l-arginine are consistent with prior studies investigating the effects of graft preservation injury following liver transplantation.

The degree of inflammation was evaluated at early and late time points by visual inspection and histopathologic analysis. In addition, the side effects of CFA injections were evaluated based on clinical findings, behavioral changes, physiologic state, and (histo)pathologic lesions. Pigs were injected with CFA at the back of the neck's skin at different depths. All animals showed histologic signs of inflammation at the injection site. Animals injected SC did not show any signs of pain or distress (loss of appetite, abnormal behavior) and did not require pain medication. Inflammation was followed by measuring the area of induration beneath the skin. Animals injected into the dermis and/or epidermis demonstrated a severe inflammatory response on the skin surface with massive swelling, redness within 12hrs of CFA injection, and severe skin necrosis within a week, preventing accurate induration measurements. In contrast to animals injected SC, animals receiving intradermal and/or intraepidermal injection of CFA showed signs of distress requiring pain medication. Conclusion. SC injection of CFA in swine induces an inflammatory response that can be measured accurately by induration without causing unnecessary discomfort, providing a useful preclinical large-animal model of inflammatory skin disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nal\u00fa", "Last Name": "Navarro-Alvarez", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13 Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz M M", "Last Name": "Gon\u00e7alves", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13 Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alec R", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13 Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13 Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christene A", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13 Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of inflammation", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "29913045", "Title": "Transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism: From allo to xeno.", "Abstract": "To date, the only successful means of achieving allogeneic transplantation tolerance in the clinic has involved induction of mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism.

Despite an extensive understanding of HCMV biology during acute infection in fibroblasts, the molecular basis for latency in myeloid cells remains incomplete. This knowledge gap is due largely to the fact that the existing genetic systems require virus rescue in fibroblasts, precluding the study of genes that are essential during acute infection, yet likely play unique roles in myeloid cells or the establishment of latency. Here we present a solution to address this restriction. Through the exploitation of a hematopoietic-specific microRNA, we demonstrate a one-step recombineering approach that enables gene silencing only in cells associated with latency. As a proof of concept, here we describe a TB40/E variant that undergoes hematopoietic targeting of the Immediate Early-2 (IE2) gene to explore its function during infection of myeloid cells. While virus replication of the hematopoietic-targeted IE2 variant was unimpaired in fibroblasts, we observed a >100-fold increase in virus titers in myeloid cells. Virus replication in myeloid cells demonstrated that IE2 has a significant transcriptional footprint on both viral and host genes.

Three experimental donor animals underwent total pancreatectomy and autologous islet transplantation underneath the renal capsule to prepare an IK at a load of \u22641,000 islet equivalents (IE)/kg donor weight, leading to a chronic diabetic state during the engraftment period (fasting blood glucose >250 mg/dL). Three control donor animals underwent partial pancreatectomy (sufficient to maintain normoglycemia during islet engraftment period) and IK preparation. As in vivo functional readout for islet engraftment, the IKs were transplanted across an immunologic minor or class I mismatch barrier into diabetic, nephrectomized recipients at an islet load of \u223c4,500 IE/kg recipient weight. A 12-d course of cyclosporine was administered for tolerance induction. All experimental donors became diabetic and showed signs of end organ injury, while control donors maintained normoglycemia. All recipients of IK from both experimental and control donors achieved glycemic control over long-term follow-up, with reversal of diabetic nephropathy and with similar glucose tolerance tests.

It is therefore critical to develop strategies to prevent influenza disease. Many loss-of-function screens have been performed to identify the host proteins required for viral infection. However, there has been no systematic screen to identify the host factors that, when overexpressed, are sufficient to prevent infection. In this study, we\u00a0used CRISPR/dCas9 activation technology to perform a genome-wide overexpression screen to identify IAV restriction factors.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration concluded a comprehensive review of xenotransplantation in 2003, considerable progress has been made in the experimental laboratory to improve cell and organ xenograft survival in several pig-to-nonhuman primate systems that offer the best available models to predict clinical outcomes. Survival of heart, kidney, and islet grafts in nonhuman primates is now being measured in months or even years. The potential risks associated with xenotransplantation, for example, the transfer of an infectious microorganism, that were highlighted in the 2003 Food and Drug Administration guidance and subsequent World Health Organization consensus documents have been carefully studied and shown to be either less likely than previously thought or readily manageable by donor selection or recipient management strategies. In this context, we suggest that the national regulatory authorities worldwide should re-examine their guidelines and regulations regarding xenotransplantation, so as to better enable design and conduct of safe and informative clinical trials of cell and organ xenotransplantation when and as supported by the preclinical data.

Systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment of this class of proteins illustrates the recognition of unbranched RNA stem loops.

Porcine xenografts are viable alternatives but undergo \u03b1-1,3-galactose (Gal)-mediated hyperacute rejection and are lost by post-operative day (POD) 3 because of naturally occurring antibodies to Gal in primate recipients. Using baboons, we previously demonstrated that xenografts from GalT-KO swine (lacking Gal) provided wound coverage comparable with allografts with systemic immunosuppression. In this study, we investigate topical immunosuppression as an alternative to prolong xenograft survival. Full-thickness wounds in baboons were created and covered with xenogeneic and allogeneic split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Animals were treated with slow-release (TyroSphere-encapsulated) topical formulations (cyclosporine-A [CSA] or Tacrolimus) applied 1) directly to the STSGs only, or 2) additionally to the wound bed before STSG and 1). Topical CSA did not improve either xenograft or allograft survival (median: treated grafts = 12.5 days, control = 14 days; P = 0.27) with similar results when topical Tacrolimus was used. Pretreatment of wound beds resulted in a significant reduction of xenograft survival compared with controls (10 vs 14 days; P = 0.0002), with comparable results observed in allografts. This observation was associated with marked reduction of inflammation on histology with Tacrolimus and not CSA. Prolongation of allograft and xenograft survival after application to full-thickness wound beds was not achieved with the current formulation of topical immunosuppressants. Modulation of inflammation within the wound bed was effective with Tacrolimus pretreatment before STSG application and may serve as a treatment strategy in related fields.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Topical", "Animals", "Bandages", "Cyclosporine", "Disease Models, Animal", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Papio", "Skin Transplantation", "Tacrolimus", "Wound Healing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Mastroianni", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Zhi Yang", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Ritu", "Last Name": "Goyal", "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, The New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, Rutgers-the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mallard", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Evan A", "Last Name": "Farkash", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Leonard", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Albritton", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Kumaran", "Last Name": "Shanmugarajah", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Josef M", "Last Name": "Kurtz", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren K", "Last Name": "Macri", "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, The New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, Rutgers-the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Joachim", "Last Name": "Kohn", "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, The New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, Rutgers-the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Curtis L", "Last Name": "Cetrulo", "Affiliation": "Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}], "Journal": "Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association", "PubDate": "2018Apr20"}, {"PMID": "28591112", "Title": "The promise of organ and tissue preservation to transform medicine.", "Abstract": "The ability to replace organs and tissues on demand could save or improve millions of lives each year globally and create public health benefits on par with curing cancer.

FDA-approved diphtheria toxin-based recombinant fusion toxin for treatment of human CD25+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, it has been discontinued clinically due to the production issue related to the bacterial expression system with difficult purification. Recently we have developed monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins targeting human CD25+ cells using advanced unique diphtheria toxin resistant yeast Pichia Pastoris expression system. In vitro efficacy characterization using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG cells demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent isoforms are potent and the bivalent isoform is approximately two logs more potent than the monovalent isoform. In this study, we further assessed the in vivo efficacy of the human IL-2 fusion toxins using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mouse model. The data demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins significantly prolonged the survival of the human CD25+ tumor-bearing NSG mice in a dose-dependent manner.

To investigate ZIKV genetic flexibility, we used transposon mutagenesis to add 15-nucleotide insertions throughout the ZIKV MR766 genome and subsequently deep sequenced the viable mutants. Few ZIKV insertion mutants replicated, which likely reflects a high degree of functional constraints on the genome. The NS1 gene exhibited distinct mutational tolerances at different stages of the screen. This result may define regions of the NS1 protein that are required for the different stages of the viral life cycle. The ZIKV structural genes showed the highest degree of insertional tolerance. Although the envelope (E) protein exhibited particular flexibility, the highly conserved envelope domain II (EDII) fusion loop of the E protein was intolerant of transposon insertions. The fusion loop is also a target of pan-flavivirus antibodies that are generated against other flaviviruses and neutralize a broad range of dengue virus and ZIKV isolates. The genetic restrictions identified within the epitopes in the EDII fusion loop likely explain the sequence and antigenic conservation of these regions in ZIKV and among multiple flaviviruses. Thus, our results provide insights into the genetic restrictions on ZIKV that may affect the evolution of this virus.IMPORTANCE Zika virus recently emerged as a significant human pathogen. Determining the genetic constraints on Zika virus is important for understanding the factors affecting viral evolution. We used a genome-wide transposon mutagenesis screen to identify where mutations were tolerated in replicating viruses. We found that the genetic regions involved in RNA replication were mostly intolerant of mutations. The genes coding for structural proteins were more permissive to mutations. Despite the flexibility observed in these regions, we found that epitopes bound by broadly reactive antibodies were genetically constrained. This finding may explain the genetic conservation of these epitopes among flaviviruses.", "Keywords": ["Zika virus", "genetic mapping", "mutagenesis", "transposons"], "MeSH terms": ["Conserved

Second-degree burns were created on young swine using brass cylinders, warmed to varying temperatures before skin contact. Animals were treated in double-blind fashion with normal saline, control peptide, or blocking peptide. Biopsies were taken at 2 hours, 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after burn injury. Burn wound healing parameters were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, immunoglobulin (Ig)M, and interleukin (IL)-8 were also performed. N2 blocking peptide administration decreased dermal injury at 4 days with increased reepithelization, indicating more rapid healing. N2 normalized skin histology by 14 days and showed improved epidermal healing. Granulation tissue thickness was decreased, and there was an accompanying decrease in neutrophil infiltration. The basal layer of epidermis in N2-treated animals displayed more cells positive for Ki-67, suggesting a prompter regenerative capacity. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated decreased deposition of immunoglobulin M and interleukin-8 after thermal injury in animals treated with N2 peptide, in comparison to controls.

Thus, we performed a side-by-side comparative study of fresh vs frozen skin grafts, across both minor and major histocompatibility barriers, in a miniature swine model. Since porcine skin shares many physical and immunological properties with human skin, our findings have relevance to current clinical practices involving allogeneic grafting and may support future, temporary wound therapies involving frozen xenografts, comprised genetically modified porcine skin. Four miniature swine underwent harvest and grafting of split-thickness skin, with and without cryopreservation, in order to observe autologous grafts and grafts across minor and major histocompatibility barriers. A biopsy of the grafts was done at regular intervals for study of architecture, vascularization, and outcomes. All grafts vascularized without technical complications. Differences were noted in the early appearance of some fresh vs frozen grafts, but no significant difference was observed in overall survival times in any of the experimental groups.

Interestingly, a significant proportion of the proliferated CD4+ cells were FOXP3+ in TOL recipients, but not in AR or naive NHPs.

Although this temporary immunity has been assumed to be the result of residual nonspecific inflammation, this period of induced immunity has not been fully studied. Because IAV has long been characterized as a cytopathic virus (based on its ability to rapidly lyse most cell types in culture), it has been a forgone conclusion that directly infected cells could not be contributing to this effect. Using a Cre recombinase-expressing IAV, we have previously shown that club cells can survive direct viral infection. We show here not only that these cells can eliminate all traces of the virus and survive but also that they acquire a heightened antiviral response phenotype after surviving. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate temporary nonspecific viral immunity after IAV infection and show that surviving cells are required for this phenotype.

While some studies have also implicated miRNAs as regulators of the antiviral response, others have found that the RISC complex that facilitates miRNA-mediated silencing is rendered nonfunctional during cellular stress, including virus infection. To determine the global role of miRNAs in the cellular response to virus infection, we generated a vector that rapidly eliminates total cellular miRNA populations in terminally differentiated primary cultures.

CCR4 is expressed on some tumor cells such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), adult peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). CCR4 is also expressed on majority of Tregs, mainly effector Tregs. In this study we have successfully developed three versions of diphtheria-toxin based anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins (monovalent, bivalent and single-chain fold-back diabody). Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that all three versions of the anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins bound to the human CCR4(+) tumor cell line as well as CCR4(+) human PBMC. The bivalent isoform bound stronger than its monovalent counterpart and the single-chain foldback diabody isoform was the strongest among the three versions. In\u00a0vitro efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform was 20 fold more potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CCR4(+) tumor cells compared to the monovalent anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin. The single-chain fold-back diabody isoform was 10 fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart and 200 fold more potent than its monovalent counterpart.

Strong genetic pressures are responsible for bottlenecks during adaptation across different host species, whereas transmission between susceptible hosts results in bottlenecks that are not genetically driven and occur at the level of the recipient.

Porcine skin shares many physical properties with human skin, but is susceptible to hyperacute rejection due to preformed antibodies to \u03b1-1,3-galactose (Gal), a carbohydrate on all porcine cells. Our preliminary studies have suggested that skin grafts from \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock out (GalT-KO) miniature swine might provide temporary wound coverage comparable to allografts, since GalT-KO swine lack this carbohydrate. To further evaluate this possibility, eight non-human primates received primary autologous, allogeneic, GalT-KO, and GalT+xenogeneic skin grafts. Additionally, secondary grafts were placed to assess whether sensitization would affect the rejection time course of identical-type grafts. We demonstrate that both GalT-KO xenografts and allografts provide temporary coverage of partial- and full-thickness wounds for up to 11 days. In contrast, GalT+xenografts displayed hyperacute rejection, with no signs of vascularization and rapid avulsion from wounds. Furthermore, secondary GalT-KO transplants failed to vascularize, demonstrating that primary graft rejection sensitizes the recipient. We conclude that GalT-KO xenografts may provide temporary coverage of wounds for a duration equivalent to allografts, and thus, could serve as a readily available alternative treatment of severe burns.", "Keywords": ["Burn treatment", "GalT-KO", "Skin graft", "Wound coverage", "Xenograft"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Biological Dressings", "Burns", "Cyclosporine", "Galactosyltransferases", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Papio hamadryas", "Skin Transplantation", "Swine", "Swine, Miniature", "Transplantation, Heterologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angelo A", "Last Name": "Leto Barone", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Mastroianni", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Evan A", "Last Name": "Farkash", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mallard", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Albritton", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Radbeh", "Last Name": "Torabi", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Leonard", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Josef M", "Last Name": "Kurtz", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Biology, Emmanuel College, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Curtis L", "Last Name": "Cetrulo", "Affiliation": "Transplant Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.

In this study, we have developed diphtheria toxin-based monovalent and bivalent murine IL-2 fusion toxins for depleting murine IL-2 receptor positive cells including CD25(+) Treg in vivo. Their potencies were assessed by in vitro protein synthesis inhibition and cell proliferation inhibition assays using a murine CD25(+) CTLL-2 cell line. Surprisingly, in contrast to our previously developed recombinant fusion toxins, the monovalent isoform (DT390-mIL-2) was approximately 4-fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart (DT390-bi-mIL-2). Binding analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that the monovalent isoform bound stronger than the bivalent version. In vivo Treg depletion with the monovalent murine IL-2 fusion toxin was performed using C57BL/6J (B6) mice.

Thus, Treg have proven to be key players in the induction of transplantation tolerance, protection from autoimmune disease and prevention of the development of effective anti-tumor immune reactions. Treg express high levels of the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) consisting of IL-2R\u03b1 (CD25) together with IL-2R\u03b2 (CD122) and the common \u03b3-chain (CD132). An effective reagent capable of depleting Treg in vivo would facilitate better cancer treatment and allow mechanistic studies of the role of Treg in transplantation tolerance and the development of autoimmune disease. In this study, we have developed a novel bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxin along with an Ontak\u00ae-like monovalent human IL-2 fusion toxin and compared the functional ability of these reagents in vitro. Here we show that genetically linking two human IL-2 domains in tandem, thereby generating a bivalent fusion toxin, results in significantly improved capacity in targeting human CD25(+) cells in vitro. Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that the bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxin has notably increased affinity for human CD25(+) cells. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform has an increased potency of approximately 2 logs in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CD25(+) cells compared to the monovalent human IL-2 fusion toxin. Additionally, we performed two inhibition assays in order to verify that the fusion toxins target the cells specifically through binding of the human IL-2 domain of the fusion toxin to the human IL-2 receptor on the cell surface. These results demonstrated that 1) both monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins are capable of blocking the binding of biotinylated human IL-2 to human CD25 by flow cytometry; and 2) human IL-2 blocked the fusion toxins from inhibiting protein synthesis and cellular proliferation in vitro, thus confirming that the human IL-2 fusion toxins target the cells specifically through binding to the human IL-2 receptor.

We propose a model in which certain influenza A virus proteins (or protein domains) exist as highly plastic scaffolds, which will readily accept mutations yet retain their functionality.

Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which is a commonly used T cell depletion antibody in clinical organ and cell transplantation protocols, is effective in temporarily depleting peripheral blood T lymphocytes but only moderately effective in depleting peripheral lymph node T cells which comprise the majority of T lymphocytes. A recombinant anti-CD3 immunotoxin, A-dmDT390-scfbDb (C207), has been developed and shown in an initial study to retain the lymph node depleting properties of conjugated CD3 immunotoxin. This agent could potentially be used synergistically with or as a replacement for rabbit ATG in preclinical primate models of transplantation. We directly compared the peripheral blood and lymph node depleting abilities of this recombinant anti-CD3 immunotoxin and rabbit ATG in na\u00efve animals at clinically tolerated doses. Baboons were treated with a full course of either rabbit ATG (n=2) or CD3 immunotoxin (n=3). Peripheral blood and lymph node T lymphocytes were measured before and following treatment. Peripheral blood CD3+ cells fell below 100cells/\u03bcL in every animal. In the two animals receiving ATG, CD3+ cells represented 53% and 68% of lymph node cells two days following a full course of rabbit ATG.

Because their major role is to ensure that the immune system is not over reactive, Tregs have been the focus of multiple research studies including those investigating transplantation tolerance, autoimmunity and cancer treatment. On their surface Tregs constitutively express CD25, a high affinity receptor for the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). The reagents constructed in this study were generated by genetically linking porcine IL-2 to the truncated diphtheria toxin (DT390). This reagent functions by first binding to the cell surface via the porcine IL-2/porcine CD25 interaction then the DT390 domain facilitates internalization followed by inhibition of protein synthesis resulting in cell death. Four versions of the porcine IL-2 fusion toxin were designed in an interest to find the most effective isoform: 1) monovalent glycosylated porcine IL-2 fusion toxin (Gly); 2) monovalent non-N-glycosylated porcine IL-2 fusion toxin (NonGly); 3) bivalent glycosylated porcine IL-2 fusion toxin (Bi-Gly); 4) bivalent non-N-glycosylated porcine IL-2 fusion toxin (Bi-NonGly). Using a porcine CD25(+) B cell lymphoma cell line (LCL13271) in vitro analysis of the fusion toxins' ability to inhibit protein synthesis demonstrated that the Bi-NonGly fusion toxin is the most efficient reagent. These in vitro results are consistent with binding affinity as the Bi-NonGly fusion toxin binds strongest to CD25 on the same LCL13271 cells. The Bi-Gly fusion toxin significantly prolonged the survival (p=0.028) of tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor \u03b3(-/-) (NSG) mice injected with LCL13271 cells compared with untreated controls.

In this system, natural selection, defined by siRNA production, permits the identification of host restriction factors through virus enrichment during a physiological infection.

Upon binding of the fusion protein to the cell of interest, the diphtheria toxin is internalized which results in protein synthesis inhibition and subsequent cell death. We have recently expressed and purified the recombinant soluble porcine CTLA-4 both with and without N-glycosylation in yeast Pichia pastoris for in vivo use in our preclinical swine model. The glycosylated and non-N-glycosylated versions of this recombinant protein each bind to a porcine CD80 expressing B-cell lymphoma line (LCL13271) with equal affinity (K(D)=13 nM). In this study we have linked each of the glycosylated and non-N-glycosylated soluble porcine CTLA-4 proteins to the truncated diphtheria toxin DT390 through genetic engineering yielding three versions of the porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxins: 1) monovalent glycosylated soluble porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxin; 2) monovalent non-N-glycosylated soluble porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxin and 3) bivalent non-N-glycosylated soluble porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxin. Protein synthesis inhibition analysis demonstrated that while all three fusion toxins are capable of inhibiting protein synthesis in vitro, the non-N-glycosylated porcine CTLA-4 isoforms function most efficiently. Binding analysis using flow cytometry of the porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxins to LCL13271 cells also demonstrated that the non-N-glycosylated porcine CTLA-4 isoforms bind to these cells with higher affinity compared to the glycosylated fusion toxin. The monovalent non-N-glycosylated porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxin was tested in vivo. NSG (NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor \u03b3(-)/(-)) mice were injected with porcine CD80(+) LCL13271 tumor cells. All animals succumbed to tumors and those treated with the monovalent non-N-glycosylated porcine CTLA-4 fusion toxin survived longer based on a symptomatic scoring system compared to the untreated controls.

A total of 10 patients with ESRD and MM have been treated with this initial protocol. Only 2 recipients developed evidence of reversible renal allograft rejection after stopping immunosuppression. Long-term (up to 14 years) operational renal allograft tolerance has been observed in all 10 patients, even in those with transient hematopoietic chimerism. Control of the MM has been less complete, as recurrent disease developed in five of these patients, three of whom expired. Nevertheless, in view of the essentially 100% 3-5 year mortality typically expected with alternative treatments for this challenging population, it has been suggested that combined kidney and donor bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) following non-myeloablative conditioning should become the standard therapy for patients with ESRD secondary to MM (27). These encouraging results, as well as the acceptable morbidity observed in cancer patients receiving non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched bone marrow transplantation in our center, led us to next evaluate CKBMT in 10 patients of HLA-mismatched transplants. All 10 subjects developed transient chimerism and in seven of these, immunosuppression was successfully discontinued. Four subjects continue to be immunosuppression free for periods of 4.5-11 years, while in three, reinstitution of immunosuppression was advised or accomplished after 5-8 years due to recurrence of original disease or chronic antibody mediated rejection. Donor-specific antibodies were frequently detectable in the earlier recipients. In contrast, no donor-specific antibodies were detected after immunosuppression was discontinued in the last four subjects, who showed more consistent and durable B-cell depletion. In conclusion, our studies have shown that immunosuppression-free renal allograft survival can be achieved in both HLAmatched and mismatched donor-recipient pairs, with follow up times now of greater than 14 years after induction of transient chimerism through CKBMT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "HLA Antigens", "Histocompatibility Testing", "Humans", "Isoantibodies", "Kidney Transplantation", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Myeloablative Agonists", "Primates", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation Chimera", "Transplantation Tolerance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "A Benedict", "Last Name": "Cosimi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatsuo", "Last Name": "Kawai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplants", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23222822", "Title": "Transplantation: a report of progress.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Congresses as Topic", "Journal Impact Factor", "Periodicals as Topic", "Societies, Medical", "Transplantation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J Andrew", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Hardy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Neuberger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manikkam", "Last Name": "Suthanthiran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2013Jan15"}, {"PMID": "23114532", "Title": "Induction of tolerance of vascularized composite allografts.", "Abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation has become established as a clinical specialty since the first successful hand transplant was performed in 1998. Data now available indicate that hand and face transplants offer patients good functional outcomes and significant improvements in quality of life. Despite the debilitating nature of the injuries treated by such transplants, the defects are generally not life threatening, making it difficult for physicians to recommend life-long immunosuppression that can itself have grave consequences. One potential solution to this dilemma is the induction of immunologic tolerance of the tissue transplants because tolerance would eliminate the need for such immunosuppression. Transplant tolerance may also prevent chronic rejection, a significant source of late graft loss after organ transplantation.Induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism is a robust approach to establishing such transplant tolerance, which recently led to the first clinical application of a tolerance induction protocol for kidney transplantation. In this manuscript, we review the current status of VCA and of research directed toward bringing a tolerance approach to the VCA field. We also discuss the potential clinical significance of these studies and outline the remaining obstacles to introduction of a tolerance induction protocol to clinical practice in hand or face transplantation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Graft Rejection", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Models, Animal", "Tissue Transplantation", "Transplantation Chimera", "Transplantation Tolerance", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Leonard", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, MGH-East Building 149, 13th Street, Boston, MA 02129, USA."}, {"First Name": "Curtis L", "Last Name": "Cetrulo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Duncan A", "Last Name": "McGrouther", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2013Feb15"}, {"PMID": "22707437", "Title": "The gracilis myocutaneous free flap in swine: an advantageous preclinical model for vascularized composite allograft transplantation research.", "Abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) has become a clinical reality, prompting research aimed at improving the risk-benefit ratio of such transplants.

End-to-end anastomoses were performed to the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, or to the femoral vessels of the recipients. Thirteen of fourteen flaps were successful. A single flap was lost due to compromise of venous outflow. This model allows transplantation of a substantial volume of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle.
