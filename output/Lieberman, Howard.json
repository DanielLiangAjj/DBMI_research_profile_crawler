Analysis.", "Abstract": "Background: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined by the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS TQIP) using laboratory findings, pathophysiologic signs/symptoms, and imaging criteria. However, many critically ill trauma patients meet the non-specific laboratory and sign/symptom thresholds for VAP, so the TQIP designation of VAP depends heavily upon imaging evidence. We hypothesized that physician opinions widely vary regarding chest radiograph findings significant for VAP. Patients and Methods: The TQIP Spring 2021 Benchmark Report (BR) was used to identify 14 patients with VAP at an academic Level 1 Trauma Center. Critically ill trauma patients (n\u2009=\u20097) who spent at least four days intubated and met TQIP's laboratory and sign/symptom thresholds for VAP but did not appear as VAPs on the BR comprised the control group. For each deidentified patient, four successive chest radiographic images were compiled and arranged chronologically. Cases and controls were randomly arranged in digital format. Blinded physicians (n\u2009=\u200927) were asked to identify patients with VAP based solely on imaging evidence. Results: Radiographic evidence of VAP was highly subjective (Krippendorff \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.134). Among physicians of the same job description, inter-rater reliability remained low (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.137 for trauma attending physicians; \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.141 for trauma fellows; \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.271 for radiologists). When majority judgment was compared to the TQIP BR, there was disagreement between the two tests (Cohen \u03ba\u2009=\u2009-0.071; sensitivity, 64.3%; specificity, 28.6%). Conclusions: Current definitions of VAP rely on subjective imaging interpretation and ignore the reality that there are numerous explanations for opacities on CXR. The inconsistency of physicians' imaging interpretation and protean physiologic findings for VAP in trauma patients should preclude the current definition of VAP from being used as a quality improvement metric in TQIP.", "Keywords": ["TQIP", "VAP", "benchmarking", "quality improvement", "trauma", "ventilator-associated pneumonia"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated", "Critical Illness", "Reproducibility of Results"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Walter A", "Last Name": "Ramsey", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher F", "Last Name": "O'Neil", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Saberi", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Meece", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gareth P", "Last Name": "Gilna", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joyce I", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard M", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward B", "Last Name": "Lineen", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan P", "Last Name": "Meizoso", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Louis R", "Last Name": "Pizano", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shevonne S", "Last Name": "Satahoo", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gary H", "Last Name": "Danton", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth G", "Last Name": "Proctor", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Namias", "Affiliation": "DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."}], "Journal": "Surgical infections", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "34298089", "Title": "FOXP1 and NDRG1 act differentially as downstream effectors of RAD9-mediated prostate cancer cell functions.", "Abstract": "Metastatic progression is the key feature of prostate cancer primarily responsible for mortality caused by this disease. RAD9 is an oncogene for prostate cancer, and the encoded protein enhances metastasis-related phenotypes. RAD9 is a transcription factor with a limited set of regulated target genes, but the complete list of downstream genes critical for prostate carcinogenesis is unknown. We used microarray gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation in parallel to identify genes transcriptionally controlled by RAD9 that contribute to this cancer. We found expression of 44 genes altered in human prostate cancer DU145 cells when RAD9 is knocked down by siRNA, and all of them bind RAD9 at their genomic location. FOXP1 and NDRG1 were down regulated when RAD9 expression was reduced, and we evaluated them further. We demonstrate that reduced RAD9, FOXP1 or NDGR1 expression decreases cell proliferation, rapid migration, anchorage-independent growth, anoikis resistance, and aerobic glycolysis. Ectopic expression of FOXP1 or NDRG1 partially restored aerobic glycolysis to prostate cancer cells with reduced RAD9 abundance, but only FOXP1 significantly complemented the other deficiencies.

Methods: A series of 99 patients admitted to an American College of Surgeons-verified level 1 trauma center over a two-year period who received VC or VM for >48 hours were reviewed retrospectively. Exclusion criteria were existing renal dysfunction or on renal replacement therapy. The primary outcome was AKI as defined by a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) to 1.5 times baseline.

RAD9 stabilizes the genome, but prostate cancer cells and tumors often have high quantities of the protein. Reduction of RAD9 level within prostate cancer cells decreases tumorigenicity of nude mouse xenographs and metastasis phenotypes in culture, indicating that RAD9 overproduction is essential for the disease. In prostate cancer DU145 cells, CpG hypermethylation in a transcription suppressor site of RAD9 intron 2 causes high-level gene expression. Herein, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B are highly abundant in prostate cancer cells DU145, CWR22, LNCaP and PC-3; yet, these DNMTs bind primarily to the transcription suppressor in DU145, the only cells where methylation is critical for RAD9 regulation. For DU145 cells, DNMT1 or DNMT3B shRNA reduced RAD9 level and tumorigenicity, and RAD9 ectopic expression restored this latter activity in the DNMT knockdown cells. High levels of RAD9, DNMT1, DNMT3B and RAD9 transcription suppressor hypermethylation were significantly correlated in prostate tumors, and not in normal prostate tissues. Based on these results, we propose a novel model where RAD9 is regulated epigenetically by DNMT1 and DNMT3B, via targeted hypermethylation, and that consequent RAD9 overproduction promotes prostate tumorigenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "DNA Methyltransferase 3B"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aiping", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Hopkins", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Bernstock", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Constantinos G", "Last Name": "Broustas", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard B", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2021Feb25"}, {"PMID": "32723396", "Title": "Colonic perforation due to inadvertent intraperitoneal LVAD driveline placement.", "Abstract": "Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are placed for patients with advanced heart failure or cardiogenic shock as destination therapy or as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.

However, treatment failure often ensues due to tumor intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Here we find that the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway is associated with resistance to genotoxic stress in aggressive prostate cancer cells. MEK5 knockdown by RNA interference sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and etoposide treatment, as assessed by clonogenic survival and short-term proliferation assays. Mechanistically, MEK5 downregulation impairs phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK at serine 2056 in response to IR or etoposide treatment. Although MEK5 knockdown does not influence the initial appearance of radiation- and etoposide-induced \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci, it markedly delays their resolution, indicating a DNA repair defect. A cell-based assay shows that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is compromised in cells with ablated MEK5 protein expression. Finally, MEK5 silencing combined with focal irradiation causes strong inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenografts, compared with MEK5 depletion or radiation alone.

The protein classically functions as part of the RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 complex but can also act independently. RAD9A can selectively transactivate multiple genes, including CDKN1A and NEIL1 by binding p53-consensus sequences in or near promoters. RAD9A is overexpressed in human prostate cancer specimens and cell lines; its expression correlates with tumor progression. Silencing RAD9A in prostate cancer cells impairs their ability to form tumors in vivo and migrate as well as grow anchorage independently in vitro. We demonstrate herein that RAD9A transcriptionally controls AGR2, a gene aberrantly overexpressed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Transient or stable knockdown of RAD9A in PC-3 cells caused downregulation of AGR2 protein abundance. Reduced AGR2 protein levels were due to lower abundance of AGR2 mRNA. The AGR2 genomic region upstream of the coding initiation site contains several p53 consensus sequences. RAD9A bound specifically to the 5'-untranslated region of AGR2 in PC-3 cells at a partial p53 consensus sequence at position +3136 downstream from the transcription start site, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by PCR amplification. Binding of RAD9A to the p53 consensus sequence was sufficient to drive AGR2 gene transcription, shown by a luciferase reporter assay. In contrast, when the RAD9A-binding sequence on the AGR2 was mutated, no luciferase activity was detected. Knockdown of RAD9A in PC-3 cells impaired cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. However, ectopically expressed AGR2 in RAD9A-depleted PC-3 cells restored these phenotypes.

Much progress has been made in recent years to understand the underlying genetic basis that drives prostate cancer. Such mechanistic information is useful for development of novel therapeutic targets, to identify biomarkers for early detection or to distinguish between aggressive and indolent disease, and to predict treatment outcome. Multiple tests have become available in recent years to address these clinical needs for prostate cancer. We describe several of these assays, summarizing test details, performance characteristics, and acknowledging their limitations. There is a pressing unmet need for novel biomarkers that can demonstrate improvement in these areas. We introduce one such candidate biomarker, RAD9, describe its functions in the DNA damage response, and detail why it can potentially fill this void. RAD9 has multiple roles in prostate carcinogenesis, making it potentially useful as a clinical tool for men with prostate cancer. RAD9 was originally identified as a radioresistance gene, and subsequent investigations revealed several key functions in the response of cells to DNA damage, including involvement in cell cycle checkpoint control, at least five DNA repair pathways, and apoptosis. Further studies indicated aberrant overexpression in approximately 45% of prostate tumors, with a strong correlation between RAD9 abundance and cancer stage. A causal relationship between RAD9 and prostate cancer was first demonstrated using a mouse model, where tumorigenicity of human prostate cancer cells after subcutaneous injection into nude mice was diminished when RNA interference was used to reduce the normally high levels of the protein. In addition to activity needed for the initial development of tumors, cell culture studies indicated roles for RAD9 in promoting prostate cancer progression by controlling cell migration and invasion through regulation of ITGB1 protein levels, and anoikis resistance by modulating AKT activation. Furthermore, RAD9 enhances the resistance of human prostate cancer cells to radiation in part by regulating ITGB1 protein abundance. RAD9 binds androgen receptor and inhibits androgen-induced androgen receptor's activity as a transcription factor. Moreover, RAD9 also acts as a gene-specific transcription factor, through binding p53 consensus sequences at target gene promoters, and this likely contributes to its oncogenic activity. Given these diverse and extensive activities, RAD9 plays important roles in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and can potentially serve as a valuable biomarker useful in the management of patients with this disease.", "Keywords": ["Biomarker", "RAD9", "oncogene", "prostate cancer", "tumor suppressor"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Howard B", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex J", "Last Name": "Rai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and Special Chemistry Laboratories, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Hopkins", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Constantinos G", "Last Name": "Broustas", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational cancer research", "PubDate": "2018Jul"}, {"PMID": "29783995", "Title": "Bowel obstruction due to retained intraperitoneal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) driveline.", "Abstract": "Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) provide a lifesaving bridge to cardiac transplant.

Whether damage occurs spontaneously as a byproduct of normal metabolic processes, or after exposure to exogenous agents, cells muster a coordinated, complex DNA damage response (DDR) to mitigate potential harmful effects. A variety of activities are involved to promote cell survival, and include DNA repair, DNA damage tolerance, as well as transient cell cycle arrest to provide time for repair before entry into critical cell cycle phases, an event that could be lethal if traversal occurs while damage is present. When such damage is prolonged or not repairable, senescence, apoptosis or autophagy is induced. One major level of DDR regulation occurs via the orchestrated transcriptional control of select sets of genes encoding proteins that mediate the response. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates specific DDR downstream genes through binding DNA consensus sequences usually in or near target gene promoter regions. The profile of p53-regulated genes activated at any given time varies, and is dependent upon type of DNA damage or stress experienced, exact composition of the consensus DNA binding sequence, presence of other DNA binding proteins, as well as cell context. RAD9 is another protein critical for the response of cells to DNA damage, and can also selectively regulate gene transcription. The limited studies addressing the role of RAD9 in transcription regulation indicate that the protein transactivates at least one of its target genes, p21/waf1/cip1, by binding to DNA sequences demonstrated to be a p53 response element. NEIL1 is also regulated by RAD9 through a similar DNA sequence, though not yet directly verified as a bonafide p53 response element. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby p53 and RAD9 control the DDR through a shared mechanism involving an overlapping network of downstream target genes.

Defects in cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair genes, especially mutation or aberrant downregulation, are associated with a wide spectrum of human disease, including a predisposition to the development of neurodegenerative conditions and cancer. On the other hand, upregulation of DNA damage response and repair genes can also cause cancer, as well as increase resistance of cancer cells to DNA damaging therapy. In recent years, it has become evident that many of the genes involved in DNA damage repair have additional roles in tumorigenesis, most prominently by acting as transcriptional (co-)factors. Although defects in these genes are causally connected to tumor initiation, their role in tumor progression is more controversial and it seems to depend on tumor type. In some tumors like melanoma, cell cycle checkpoint/DNA repair gene upregulation is associated with tumor metastasis, whereas in a number of other cancers the opposite has been observed. Several genes that participate in the DNA damage response, such as RAD9, PARP1, BRCA1, ATM and TP53 have been associated with metastasis by a number of in vitro biochemical and cellular assays, by examining human tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry or by DNA genome-wide gene expression profiling. Many of these genes act as transcriptional effectors to regulate other genes implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer. Furthermore, they are aberrantly expressed in numerous human tumors and are causally related to tumorigenesis. However, whether the DNA damage repair function of these genes is required to promote metastasis or another activity is responsible (e.g., transcription control) has not been determined. Importantly, despite some compelling in vitro evidence, investigations are still needed to demonstrate the role of cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair genes in regulating metastatic phenotypes in vivo.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "Humans", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Constantinos G", "Last Name": "Broustas", "Affiliation": "a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Howard B", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24013428", "Title": "Clamping down on mammalian meiosis.", "Abstract": "The RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex is a PCNA-like heterotrimeric clamp that binds damaged DNA to promote cell cycle checkpoint signaling and DNA repair.

This was investigated in 2 recent studies in which the 9-1-1 complex was disrupted specifically in the mouse male germline through conditional deletion of Rad9a or Hus1. Loss of these clamp subunits led to severely impaired fertility and meiotic defects, including faulty DNA double-strand break repair. While 9-1-1 is critical for ATR kinase activation in somatic cells, these studies did not reveal major defects in ATR checkpoint pathway signaling in meiotic cells.

In this study, we determined that RAD9A is indeed expressed in the male germ line with a peak of expression in late pachytene and diplotene stages, and the protein was found associated with the XY body. As complete loss of RAD9A is embryonic lethal, we constructed and characterized a mouse strain with Stra8-Cre driven germ cell-specific ablation of Rad9a beginning in undifferentiated spermatogonia in order to assess its role in spermatogenesis.
