Here, we apply blastocyst complementation to selectively build and test interspecies neural circuits. Despite approximately 10-20 million years of evolution, and prominent species differences in brain size, rat pluripotent stem cells injected into mouse blastocysts develop and persist throughout the mouse brain. Unexpectedly, the mouse niche reprograms the birth dates of rat neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, supporting rat-mouse synaptic activity. When mouse olfactory neurons are genetically silenced or killed, rat neurons restore information flow to odor processing circuits. Moreover, they rescue the primal behavior of food seeking, although less well than mouse neurons. By revealing that a mouse can sense the world using neurons from another species, we establish neural blastocyst complementation as a powerful tool to identify conserved mechanisms of brain development, plasticity, and repair.", "Keywords": ["blastocyst complementation", "brain evolution", "brain regeneration", "development", "disease models", "interspecies chimeras", "neural circuits", "neurons", "olfaction", "pluripotent stem cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Rats", "Neurons", "Blastocyst", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Brain", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Species Specificity", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Throesch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Khadeesh", "Last Name": "Bin Imtiaz", "Affiliation": "Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rodrigo", "Last Name": "Mu\u00f1oz-Casta\u00f1eda", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Sakurai", "Affiliation": "Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea L", "Last Name": "Hartzell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kiely N", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto R", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Mouse Genetics Core, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Greg", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Mouse Genetics Core, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giordano", "Last Name": "Lippi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Kupriyanov", "Affiliation": "Mouse Genetics Core, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhuhao", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavel", "Last Name": "Osten", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan Carlos", "Last Name": "Izpisua Belmonte", "Affiliation": "Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Gene Expression Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Altos Labs, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.

In a physiological environment, cultured cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from patients who are homozygous for cardiovascular-risk alleles (R/R cardiomyocytes) or from healthy individuals who are homozygous for nonrisk alleles contracted synchronously, independently of genotype. After hydrogel stiffening to mimic fibrosis, only the R/R cardiomyocytes exhibited asynchronous contractions. These effects were associated with increased expression of the short ANRIL isoform in R/R cardiomyocytes, which induced a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation-based mechanism that impaired gap junctions (particularly, loss of connexin-43 expression) following stiffening. Deletion of the risk locus or treatment with a JNK antagonist was sufficient to maintain gap junctions and prevent asynchronous contraction of cardiomyocytes.

How the reduced expression of frataxin leads to neurological and other systemic symptoms in FRDA patients remains unclear. Similar to other triplet-repeat disorders, it is unknown why FRDA affects only specific cell types, primarily the large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and cardiomyocytes. The combination of iPSC technology and genome-editing techniques offers the unique possibility to address these questions in a relevant cell model of FRDA, obviating confounding effects of variable genetic backgrounds.

We screen a lentiviral library encoding \u223c100 million secreted and membrane-bound single-chain antibodies and identify antibodies that can replace either Sox2 and Myc (c-Myc) or Oct4 during reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into iPSCs. We show that one Sox2-replacing antibody antagonizes the membrane-associated protein Basp1, thereby de-repressing nuclear factors WT1, Esrrb and Lin28a (Lin28) independent of Sox2.
