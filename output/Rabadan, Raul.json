Computational models are increasingly being used to predict the functional impact of these mutations, in both coding and noncoding regions.

Although the protein coding target genes of p53 have been well studied, less is known about its role in regulating long noncoding genes and their functional relevance to cancer. Here we report the genome-wide identification of a large set (>1,000) of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which are putative p53 targets in a colon cancer cell line and in human patient datasets from five different common types of cancer. These lncRNAs have not been annotated by other studies of normal unstressed systems. In the colon cancer cell line, a high proportion of these lncRNAs are uniquely induced by different chemotherapeutic agents that activate p53, whereas others are induced by more than one agent tested. Further, subsets of these lncRNAs independently predict overall and disease-free survival of patients across the five different common cancer types. Interestingly, both genetic alterations and patient survival associated with different lncRNAs are unique to each cancer tested, indicating extraordinary tissue-specific variability in the p53 noncoding response.

Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states.

Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds.

However, GBM frequently relapses within the irradiated margins, thus suggesting that RT might stimulate mechanisms of resistance that limits its efficacy. GBM is recognized for its metabolic plasticity, but whether RT-induced resistance relies on metabolic adaptation remains unclear. Here, we show in vitro and in vivo that irradiated GBM tumors switch their metabolic program to accumulate lipids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. This resulted in an increased formation of lipid droplets to prevent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The reduction of lipid accumulation with genetic suppression and pharmacological inhibition of the fatty acid synthase (FASN), one of the main lipogenic enzymes, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis of irradiated GBM cells. Combination of FASN inhibition with focal RT improved the median survival of GBM-bearing mice.

The incidence varies worldwide, with a majority affecting developing countries. Here, we present a comparative analysis of virus-positive and virus-negative tumors in nine cancers linked to five viruses. We find that virus-positive tumors occur more frequently in males and show geographical disparities in incidence. Genomic analysis of 1,658 tumors reveals virus-positive tumors exhibit distinct mutation signatures and driver gene mutations and possess a lower somatic mutation burden compared to virus-negative tumors of the same cancer type. For example, compared to the respective virus-negative counterparts, virus-positive cases across different cancer histologies had less often mutations of TP53 and deletions of 9p21.3/ CDKN2 A- CDKN1A ; Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) gastric cancer had more frequent mutations of EIF4A1 and ARID1A and less marked mismatch repair deficiency signatures; and EBV-positive cHL had fewer somatic genetic lesions of JAK-STAT, NF-\u03baB, PI3K-AKT and HLA-I genes and a less pronounced activity of the aberrant somatic hypermutation signature. In cHL, we also identify germline homozygosity in HLA class I as a potential risk factor for the development of EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. Finally, an analysis of clinical trials of PD-(L)1 inhibitors in four virus-associated cancers suggested an association of viral infection with higher response rate in patients receiving such treatments, which was particularly evident in gastric cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

While immunotherapies have been beneficial with many different types of solid tumors, they have almost uniformly failed in the treatment of PDAC. Understanding how therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can provide insights for the development of strategies to treat PDAC. We used quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescence (qmIF) quantitative spatial analysis (qSA), and immunogenomic (IG) analysis to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 44 patients with PDAC including 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and 26 patients receiving no treatment (NT) and compared them with tissues from 40 treatment-na\u00efve melanoma patients. We find that relative to NT tumors, CD3+ T cell infiltration was increased in CRT treated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0006), including increases in CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs, p =\u00a0.0079), CD3+CD4+FOXP3- T helper cells (Th, p =\u00a0.0010), and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs, p =\u00a0.0089) with no difference in CD68+ macrophages. IG analysis from micro-dissected tissues indicated overexpression of genes involved in antigen presentation, T cell activation, and inflammation in CRT treated tumors. Among treated patients, a higher ratio of Tregs to total T cells was associated with shorter survival time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0121). Despite comparable levels of infiltrating T cells in CRT PDACs to melanoma, PDACs displayed distinct spatial profiles with less T cell clustering as defined by nearest neighbor analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These findings demonstrate that, while CRT can achieve high T cell densities in PDAC compared to melanoma, phenotype and spatial organization of T cells may limit benefit of T cell infiltration in this immunotherapy-resistant tumor.", "Keywords": ["T regulatory cells", "Tumor microenvironment", "biomarkers", "tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Gartrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Enzler", "Affiliation": "Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ladan", "Last Name": "Fazlollahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew X", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanna E", "Last Name": "Minns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Subha", "Last Name": "Perni", "Affiliation": "Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart P", "Last Name": "Weisberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuelle M", "Last Name": "Rizk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eun Jeong", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinzheng V", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Codruta", "Last Name": "Chiuzan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Bates", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chabot", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Schrope", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kluger", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabad\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Remotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne M", "Last Name": "Saenger", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35443168", "Title": "Oncogenic Vav1-Myo1f induces therapeutically targetable macrophage-rich tumor microenvironment in peripheral T\u00a0cell lymphoma.", "Abstract": "Peripheral T\u00a0cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) comprises heterogeneous lymphoid malignancies characterized by pleomorphic lymphocytes and variable inflammatory cell-rich tumor microenvironment.

The PBAF complex is composed of multiple subunits, including the tumor-suppressor protein PBRM1 (BAF180), as well as ARID2 (BAF200), that are unique to this SWI/SNF complex. PBRM1 is mutated in various cancers, with a high mutation frequency in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here, we integrate RNA-seq, histone modification ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq data to show that loss of PBRM1 results in de novo gains in H3K4me3 peaks throughout the epigenome, including activation of a retinoic acid biosynthesis and signaling gene signature. We show that one such target gene, ALDH1A1, which regulates a key step in retinoic acid biosynthesis, is consistently upregulated with PBRM1 loss in ccRCC cell lines and primary tumors, as well as non-malignant cells. We further find that ALDH1A1 increases the tumorigenic potential of ccRCC cells. Using biochemical methods, we show that ARID2 remains bound to other PBAF subunits after loss of PBRM1 and is essential for increased ALDH1A1 after loss of PBRM1, whereas other core SWI/SNF components are dispensable, including the ATPase subunit BRG1.

Previously, we reported enrichment of BRAF/PTPN11 mutations in 30% of rGBM that responded to PD-1 blockade. Given that BRAF and PTPN11 promote MAPK/ERK signaling, we investigated whether activation of this pathway is associated with response to PD-1 inhibitors in rGBM, including patients that do not harbor BRAF/PTPN11 mutations. Here we show that immunohistochemistry for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), a marker of MAPK/ERK pathway activation, is predictive of overall survival following adjuvant PD-1 blockade in two independent rGBM patient cohorts. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p-ERK was mainly localized in tumor cells and that high-p-ERK GBMs contained tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia with elevated expression of MHC class\u2009II and associated genes. These findings indicate that ERK1/2 activation in rGBM is predictive of response to PD-1 blockade and is associated with a distinct myeloid cell phenotype.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

"Remodeling of the microenvironment by tumor cells can activate pathways that favor cancer growth. Molecular delineation and targeting of such malignant-cell nonautonomous pathways may help overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Herein we leverage genetic mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples to show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exploits peripheral serotonin signaling to remodel the endosteal niche to its advantage. AML progression requires the presence of serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) in osteoblasts and is driven by AML-secreted kynurenine, which acts as an oncometabolite and HTR1B ligand. AML cells utilize kynurenine to induce a proinflammatory state in osteoblasts that, through the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), acts in a positive feedback loop on leukemia cells by increasing expression of IDO1-the rate-limiting enzyme for kynurenine synthesis-thereby enabling AML progression. This leukemia-osteoblast cross-talk, conferred by the kynurenine-HTR1B-SAA-IDO1 axis, could be exploited as a niche-focused therapeutic approach against AML, opening new avenues for cancer treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Kynurenine", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Mice", "Osteoblasts", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Gal\u00e1n-D\u00edez", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Florence", "Last Name": "Borot", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Abdullah Mahmood", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Junfei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Gil-Iturbe", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xiaochuan", "Last Name": "Shan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yongfeng", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Medical School, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Xi-Ping", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Medical School, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Brygida", "Last Name": "Bisikirska", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rossella", "Last Name": "Labella", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Irwin", "Last Name": "Kurland", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bryan L", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Medical School, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabad\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Carroll", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Azra", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2022Apr01"}, {"PMID": "34930825", "Title": "SF3B1 mutant-induced missplicing of MAP3K7 causes anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes.", "Abstract": "SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated RNA splicing factor in cancer, including in \u223c25% of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. SF3B1-mutated MDS, which is strongly associated with ringed sideroblast morphology, is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to severe, often fatal anemia. However, functional evidence linking SF3B1 mutations to the anemia described in MDS patients harboring this genetic aberration is weak, and the underlying mechanism is completely unknown. Using isogenic SF3B1 WT and mutant cell lines, normal human CD34 cells, and MDS patient cells, we define a previously unrecognized role of the kinase MAP3K7, encoded by a known mutant SF3B1-targeted transcript, in controlling proper terminal erythroid differentiation, and show how MAP3K7 missplicing leads to the anemia characteristic of SF3B1-mutated MDS, although not to ringed sideroblast formation. We found that p38 MAPK is deactivated in SF3B1 mutant isogenic and patient cells and that MAP3K7 is an upstream positive effector of p38 MAPK. We demonstrate that disruption of this MAP3K7-p38 MAPK pathway leads to premature down-regulation of GATA1, a master regulator of erythroid differentiation, and that this is sufficient to trigger accelerated differentiation, erythroid hyperplasia, and ultimately apoptosis.

The calcium-independent phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 is known to cleave acyl tails from the glycerol backbone of lipids and release oxidized fatty acids from phospholipids. We found that iPLA2\u03b2-mediated detoxification of peroxidized lipids is sufficient to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress, even in GPX4-null cells. Moreover, iPLA2\u03b2 is overexpressed in human cancers; inhibition of endogenous iPLA2\u03b2 sensitizes tumor cells to p53-driven ferroptosis and promotes p53-dependent tumor suppression in xenograft mouse models. These results demonstrate that iPLA2\u03b2 acts as a major ferroptosis repressor in a GPX4-independent manner. Notably, unlike GPX4, loss of iPLA2\u03b2 has no obvious effect on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues but iPLA2\u03b2 plays an essential role in regulating ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress.

Transcriptomic and whole-exome analyses of bone metastasis from these mice revealed distinct molecular profiles conserved between human and mouse and specific patterns of subclonal branching from the primary tumor. Integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse and human datasets with functional studies in vivo unravels a unique MYC/RAS co-activation signature associated with prostate cancer metastasis.

lymphoma (DLBCL) cases lack cell-surface expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), thus escaping recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. To identify the involved mechanisms, we performed whole exome and targeted HLA deep-sequencing in 74 DLBCL samples, and found somatic inactivation of B2M and the HLA-I loci in 80% (34 of 42) of MHC-INEG tumors. Furthermore, 70% (22 of 32) of MHC-IPOS DLBCLs harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-IPOS/mono), indicating allele-specific inactivation. MHC-INEG and MHC-IPOS/mono cases harbored significantly higher mutational burden and inferred neoantigen load, suggesting potential coselection of HLA-I loss and sustained neoantigen production. Notably, the analysis of >500,000 individuals across different cancer types revealed common germline HLA-I homozygosity, preferentially in DLBCL.

suppressing effector T cell functions. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a pleiotropic kinase that acts as a key effector downstream of PI3K in many cell types. In T cells, PDK1 has been shown to be critical for activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling upon TCR ligation and is therefore essential for effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Using Treg cell-specific conditional deletion, we now demonstrate that PDK1 is also essential for Treg cell suppressive activity in vivo. Ablation of Pdk1 specifically in Treg cells led to systemic, lethal, scurfy-like inflammation in mice. Genome-wide analysis confirmed that PDK1 is essential for the regulation of key Treg cell signature gene expression and, further, suggested that PDK1 acts primarily to control Treg cell gene expression through regulation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Consistent with these results, the scurfy-like phenotype of mice lacking PDK1 in Treg cells was rescued by enforced activation of NF-\u03baB downstream of PDK1. Therefore, PDK1-mediated activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is essential for regulation of Treg cell signature gene expression and suppressor function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Animals", "CD4 Antigens", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphoproliferative Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "NF-kappa B", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hyunju", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jingyao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yenkel", "Last Name": "Grinberg-Bleyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Thomas S", "Last Name": "Postler", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Pingzhang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; and."}, {"First Name": "Sung-Gyoo", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; and."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Hayden", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; sg2715@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2021Apr15"}, {"PMID": "33606978", "Title": "Functional interrogation of DNA damage response variants with base editing screens.", "Abstract": "Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes endanger genome integrity and predispose to cancer and genetic disorders.

Understanding global patterns of recombination could help to identify underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the potential risks of rapid adaptation. Conventional approaches (e.g., those based on linkage disequilibrium) are computationally demanding or even intractable when sequence alignments include hundreds of sequences, common in viral data sets. We present a comprehensive analysis of recombination across 30 genomic alignments from viruses infecting humans. In order to scale the analysis and avoid the computational limitations of conventional approaches, we apply newly developed topological data analysis methods able to infer recombination rates for large data sets. We show that viruses, such as ZEBOV and MARV, consistently displayed low levels of recombination, whereas high levels of recombination were observed in Sarbecoviruses, HBV, HEV, Rhinovirus A, and HIV. We observe that recombination is more common in positive single-stranded RNA viruses than in negatively single-stranded RNA ones. Interestingly, the comparison across multiple viruses suggests an inverse correlation between genome length and recombination rate. Positional analyses of recombination breakpoints along viral genomes, combined with our approach, detected at least 39 nonuniform patterns of recombination (i.e., cold or hotspots) in 18 viral groups. Among these, noteworthy hotspots are found in MERS-CoV and Sarbecoviruses (at spike, Nucleocapsid and ORF8).

MYC is a key oncogene activated across most cancers, and identifying associated synthetic lethality or sickness can provide important clues about its activity and potential therapeutic strategies. On the basis of previously conducted genome-wide screenings in MCF10A cells expressing MYC fused to an estrogen receptor fragment, we identified UVSSA, a gene involved in transcription-coupled repair, whose knockdown or knockout decreased cell viability when combined with MYC expression. Synthetic sick interactions between MYC expression and UVSSA down-regulation correlated with ATM/CHK2 activation, suggesting increased genome instability. We show that the synthetic sick interaction is diminished by attenuating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity; yet, it is independent of UV-induced damage repair, suggesting that UVSSA has a critical function in regulating RNAPII in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAPII ChIP-seq revealed that MYC-dependent increases in RNAPII promoter occupancy are reduced or abrogated by UVSSA knockdown, suggesting that UVSSA influences RNAPII dynamics during MYC-dependent transcription. Taken together, our data show that the UVSSA complex has a significant function in supporting MYC-dependent RNAPII dynamics and maintaining cell survival during MYC addiction.

Transcriptomic analysis of human cancer specimens, MMTV-cre Sf3b1K700E/WT mice, and isogenic mutant cell lines identified hundreds of aberrant 3' splice sites (3'ss) induced by mutant SF3B1. Consistently between mouse and human tumors, mutant SF3B1 promoted aberrant splicing (dependent on aberrant branchpoints as well as pyrimidines downstream of the cryptic 3'ss) and consequent suppression of PPP2R5A and MAP3K7, critical negative regulators of AKT and NF-\u03baB. Coordinate activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling was observed in the knockin models, leading to accelerated cell migration and tumor development in combination with mutant PIK3CA but also hypersensitizing cells to AKT kinase inhibitors.

In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells.

While some such mutations are recurrently found in many tumors, many others exist solely within a few samples, precluding detection by conventional recurrence-based statistical approaches. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and RNA expression data across 12 tumor types reveals that mutations of cancer genes are usually accompanied by substantial changes in expression.

In this study, we generated the first BIA-ALCL patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model (IL89) and a matching continuous cell line (IL89_CL#3488) to discover potential vulnerabilities and druggable targets. We characterized IL89 and IL89_CL#3488, both phenotypically and genotypically, and demonstrated that they closely resemble the matching human primary lymphoma. The tumor content underwent significant enrichment along passages, as confirmed by the increased variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations. Known aberrations (JAK1 and KMT2C) were identified, together with novel hits, including PDGFB, PDGFRA, and SETBP1. A deep sequencing approach allowed the detection of mutations below the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) sensitivity threshold, including JAK1G1097D, in the primary sample. RNA sequencing confirmed the expression of a signature of differentially expressed genes in BIA-ALCL. Next, we tested IL89's sensitivity to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and observed a potent anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo. We also implemented a high-throughput drug screening approach to identify compounds associated with increased responses in the presence of ruxolitinib.

In the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, which, in turn, is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors. Here, we find evidence of a recombination event in the RBD involving ancestral linages to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although we cannot specify the recombinant nor the parental strains, likely due to the ancestry of the event and potential undersampling, our statistical analyses in the space of phylogenetic trees support such an ancestral recombination. Consequently, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share an RBD sequence that includes two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), as well as the variants 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts directly with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Reconstruction of ancestral states, combined with protein-binding affinity analyses using the physics-based trRosetta algorithm, reveal that the recombination event involving ancestral strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 led to an increased affinity for hACE2 binding, and that alleles 427N and 436Y significantly enhanced affinity as well. Structural modeling indicates that ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired the ability to infect humans decades ago. The binding affinity with the human receptor was subsequently boosted in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through further mutations in RBD. In sum, we report an ancestral recombination event affecting the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with an increased binding affinity to hACE2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juan \u00c1ngel", "Last Name": "Pati\u00f1o-Galindo", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathemaical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ioan", "Last Name": "Filip", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathemaical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ratul", "Last Name": "Chowdhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Costas D", "Last Name": "Maranas", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter K", "Last Name": "Sorger", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "AlQuraishi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathemaical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2021Apr06"}, {"PMID": "32430477", "Title": "CD8+ T-cell-Mediated Immunoediting Influences Genomic Evolution and Immune Evasion in Murine Gliomas.", "Abstract": "Cancer immunoediting shapes tumor progression by the selection of tumor cell variants that can evade immune recognition.

To address this issue, we performed an unbiased pan-cancer analysis to identify genetic alterations that lead to the same aberrant splicing as observed with SF3B1 mutations. This analysis identified multiple mutations in another spliceosomal gene, SUGP1, that correlated with significant usage of cryptic 3'ss known to be utilized in mutant SF3B1 expressing cells. Remarkably, this is consistent with recent biochemical studies that identified a defective interaction between mutant SF3B1 and SUGP1 as the molecular defect responsible for cryptic 3'ss usage.

Here, we characterize 98 tumors and 12 isogenic cell lines harboring SF3B1 hotspot mutations, identifying hundreds of cryptic 3' splice sites common and specific to different cancer types. Regulatory network analysis revealed that the most common SF3B1 mutation activates MYC via effects conserved across human and mouse cells. SF3B1 mutations promote decay of transcripts encoding the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit PPP2R5A, increasing MYC S62 and BCL2 S70 phosphorylation which, in turn, promotes MYC protein stability and impair apoptosis, respectively. Genetic PPP2R5A restoration or pharmacologic PP2A activation impaired SF3B1-mutant tumorigenesis, elucidating a therapeutic approach to aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1.

A deeper understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is required to stratify patients and identify factors leading to therapy resistance. We previously identified that the melanoma immune profile (MIP), an IFN-based gene signature, and the ratio of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to CD68+ macrophages both predict disease-specific survival (DSS). Here, we compared primary with metastatic tumors and found that the nuclei of tumor cells were significantly larger in metastases. The CTL/macrophage ratio was significantly different between primary tumors without distant metastatic recurrence (DMR) and metastases. Patients without DMR had higher degrees of clustering between tumor cells and CTLs, and between tumor cells and HLA-DR+ macrophages, but not HLA-DR- macrophages. The HLA-DR- subset coexpressed CD163+CSF1R+ at higher levels than CD68+HLA-DR+ macrophages, consistent with an M2 phenotype. Finally, combined transcriptomic and multiplex data revealed that densities of CD8 and M1 macrophages correlated with their respective cell phenotype signatures. Combination of the MIP signature with the CTL/macrophage ratio stratified patients into three risk groups that were predictive of DSS, highlighting the potential use of combination biomarkers for adjuvant therapy.

GICs frequently produce and respond to their own growth factors that support cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we aimed to identify critical autocrine factors mediating GIC survival and to evaluate the anti-GBM effect of antagonizing these factors. Proteomic analysis was performed using conditioned media from two different patient-derived GBM tumor spheres under a growth factor-depleted status. Then, the antitumor effects of inhibiting an identified autocrine factor were evaluated by bioinformatic analysis and molecular validation. Proteins secreted by sphere-forming GICs promote cell proliferation/survival and detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among these proteins, we focused on midkine (MDK) as a clinically significant and pathologically relevant autocrine factor. Antagonizing MDK reduced the survival of GBM tumor spheres through the promotion of cell cycle arrest and the consequent apoptotic cell death caused by oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. We also identified PCBP4, a novel molecular predictor of resistance to anti-MDK treatment.

By analysing mutations and copy numbers across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we found that driver genes detected at the initial stage of disease were retained at recurrence, whereas there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across the glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in overall survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas and was characterized by IDH mutation but without co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and further converged with acquired alterations in the cell cycle and poor outcomes. The clonal architecture of each tumour remained similar over time, but the presence of subclonal selection was associated with decreased survival.

of dysregulated glucagon secretion in the etiology of hyperglycemia and diabetes. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms underlying pancreatic islet \u03b1 cell development and function has important implications for the discovery of new therapies for diabetes. In this study, comparative transcriptome analyses between embryonic mouse pancreas and adult mouse islets identified several pancreatic lncRNAs that lie in close proximity to essential pancreatic transcription factors, including the Pax6-associated lncRNA Paupar. We demonstrate that Paupar is enriched in glucagon-producing \u03b1 cells where it promotes the alternative splicing of Pax6 to an isoform required for activation of essential \u03b1 cell genes. Consistently, deletion of Paupar in mice resulted in dysregulation of PAX6 \u03b1 cell target genes and corresponding \u03b1 cell dysfunction, including blunted glucagon secretion. These findings illustrate a distinct mechanism by which a pancreatic lncRNA can coordinate glucose homeostasis by cell-specific regulation of a broadly expressed transcription factor.", "Keywords": ["Paupar", "Pax6", "diabetes", "glucagon", "lncRNAs", "long noncoding RNAs", "pancreatic islets", "transcription factors", "\u03b1 cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Glucagon", "Glucagon-Secreting Cells", "Glucose", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "PAX6 Transcription Factor", "RNA, Long Noncoding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruth A", "Last Name": "Singer", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Studies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Arnes", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiguang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuqian", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle A", "Last Name": "Guney", "Affiliation": "Barbara Davis Center, University of Colorado Medical Center, Aurora, CO 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin E", "Last Name": "Burnum-Johnson", "Affiliation": "Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Ansong", "Affiliation": "Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Galya", "Last Name": "Orr", "Affiliation": "Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Sussel", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Barbara Davis Center, University of Colorado Medical Center, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

Here, we demonstrate a role for aberrant chromatin accessibility in the regulation of MYC expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Central to this process, the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer (N-Me), a long-range T cell-specific MYC enhancer, shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during T-cell specification and maturation and an aberrant high degree of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that GATA3-driven nucleosome eviction dynamically modulates N-Me enhancer activity and is strictly required for NOTCH1-induced T-ALL initiation and maintenance. These results directly implicate aberrant regulation of chromatin accessibility at oncogenic enhancers as a mechanism of leukemic transformation. SIGNIFICANCE: MYC is a major effector of NOTCH1 oncogenic programs in T-ALL. Here, we show a major role for GATA3-mediated enhancer nucleosome eviction as a driver of MYC expression and leukemic transformation.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing.

To address this challenge, here we developed Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), a method to integrate genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing. We apply GoT to profile 38,290 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms to study how somatic mutations corrupt the complex process of human haematopoiesis. High-resolution mapping of malignant versus normal haematopoietic progenitors revealed an increasing fitness advantage with myeloid differentiation of cells with mutated CALR. We identified the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with a considerable dependency on cell identity, as well as upregulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway specifically in uncommitted stem cells. We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci that are distant from transcript ends.

Although many readthrough events have been previously discovered in Nature, a broader description of the stimulatory RNA signals would help to identify new reprogramming events in eukaryotic genes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of readthrough. Here, we explore the RNA reprogramming landscape by performing in vitro translation selections to enrich RNA readthrough signals de novo from a starting randomized library comprising >1013 unique sequence variants. Selection products were characterized using high-throughput sequencing, from which we identified primary sequence and secondary structure readthrough features. The activities of readthrough signals, including three novel sequence motifs, were confirmed in cellular reporter assays. Then, we used machine learning and our HTS data to predict readthrough activity from human 3'-untranslated region sequences. This led to the discovery of >1.5% readthrough in four human genes (CDKN2B, LEPROTL1, PVRL3, and SFTA2).

Here, we show that loss of PHF6 is an early mutational event in leukemia transformation. Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of Phf6 in the hematopoietic system enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) long-term self-renewal and hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy by rendering Phf6 knockout HSCs more quiescent and less prone to stress-induced activation. Consistent with a leukemia-initiating tumor suppressor role, inactivation of Phf6 in hematopoietic progenitors lowers the threshold for the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Moreover, loss of Phf6 in leukemia lymphoblasts activates a leukemia stem cell transcriptional program and drives enhanced T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell activity. These results implicate Phf6 in the control of HSC homeostasis and long-term self-renewal and support a role for PHF6 loss as a driver of leukemia-initiating cell activity in T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Phf6 controls HSC homeostasis, leukemia initiation, and T-ALL leukemia-initiating cell self-renewal.

frequently occurring and invariably fatal primary brain tumor in adults. The vast majority of glioblastomas is characterized by chromosomal copy number alterations, including gain of whole chromosome 7 and loss of whole chromosome 10. Gain of whole chromosome 7 is an early event in gliomagenesis that occurs in proneural-like precursor cells, which give rise to all isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma transcriptional subtypes. Platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) is one gene on chromosome 7 known to drive gliomagenesis, but, given its location near the end of 7p, there are likely several other genes located along chromosome 7 that select for its increased whole-chromosome copy number within glioblastoma cells. To identify other potential genes that could select for gain of whole chromosome 7, we developed an unbiased bioinformatics approach that identified homeobox A5 (HOXA5) as a gene whose expression correlated with gain of chromosome 7 and a more aggressive phenotype of the resulting glioma. High expression of HOXA5 in glioblastoma was associated with a proneural gene expression pattern and decreased overall survival in both human proneural and PDGF-driven mouse glioblastoma. Furthermore, HOXA5 overexpression promoted cellular proliferation and potentiated radioresistance. We also found enrichment of HOXA5 expression in recurrent human and mouse glioblastoma at first recurrence after radiotherapy. Overall, this study implicates HOXA5 as a chromosome 7-associated gene-level locus that promotes selection for gain of whole chromosome 7 and an aggressive phenotype in glioblastoma.", "Keywords": ["HoxA", "RCAS", "chromosome 7 gain", "glioblastoma", "homeobox"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Proliferation", "Chromosome Duplication", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7", "Glioblastoma", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase", "Mice", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Phosphoproteins", "Radiation Tolerance", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Cimino", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Youngmi", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua-Jun", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard T.H.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis, by conventional pathologic methods, is predictive but is insufficiently precise for clinical application. Quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF) allows for evaluation of the TME using multiparameter phenotyping, tissue segmentation, and quantitative spatial analysis (qSA). Given that CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) promote antitumor immunity, whereas CD68+ macrophages impair immunity, we hypothesized that quantification and spatial analysis of macrophages and CTLs would correlate with clinical outcome. We applied qmIF to 104 primary stage II to III melanoma tumors and found that CTLs were closer in proximity to activated (CD68+HLA-DR+) macrophages than nonactivated (CD68+HLA-DR-) macrophages (P < 0.0001). CTLs were further in proximity from proliferating SOX10+ melanoma cells than nonproliferating ones (P < 0.0001). In 64 patients with known cause of death, we found that high CTL and low macrophage density in the stroma (P = 0.0038 and P = 0.0006, respectively) correlated with disease-specific survival (DSS), but the correlation was less significant for CTL and macrophage density in the tumor (P = 0.0147 and P = 0.0426, respectively). DSS correlation was strongest for stromal HLA-DR+ CTLs (P = 0.0005). CTL distance to HLA-DR- macrophages associated with poor DSS (P = 0.0016), whereas distance to Ki67- tumor cells associated inversely with DSS (P = 0.0006). A low CTL/macrophage ratio in the stroma conferred a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.719 for death from melanoma and correlated with shortened overall survival (OS) in the complete 104 patient cohort by Cox analysis (P = 0.009) and merits further development as a biomarker for clinical application.

It is generally accepted that CAFs stimulate tumor progression and might be implicated in drug resistance and immunosuppression. Here, we have compared the transcriptional profile of PDGFR\u03b1+ CAFs isolated from genetically engineered mouse PDAC tumors with that of normal pancreatic fibroblasts to identify genes potentially implicated in their protumorigenic properties. We report that the most differentially expressed gene, Saa3, a member of the serum amyloid A (SAA) apolipoprotein family, is a key mediator of the protumorigenic activity of PDGFR\u03b1+ CAFs. Whereas Saa3-competent CAFs stimulate the growth of tumor cells in an orthotopic model, Saa3-null CAFs inhibit tumor growth. Saa3 also plays a role in the cross talk between CAFs and tumor cells. Ablation of Saa3 in pancreatic tumor cells makes them insensitive to the inhibitory effect of Saa3-null CAFs. As a consequence, germline ablation of Saa3 does not prevent PDAC development in mice. The protumorigenic activity of Saa3 in CAFs is mediated by Mpp6, a member of the palmitoylated membrane protein subfamily of the peripheral membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK). Finally, we interrogated whether these observations could be translated to a human scenario. Indeed, SAA1, the ortholog of murine Saa3, is overexpressed in human CAFs. Moreover, high levels of SAA1 in the stromal component correlate with worse survival. These findings support the concept that selective inhibition of SAA1 in CAFs may provide potential therapeutic benefit to PDAC patients.", "Keywords": ["CAFs", "PDAC", "Saa3", "mouse models", "stroma"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Pancreas", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Serum Amyloid A Protein", "Stromal Cells", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Magdolna", "Last Name": "Djurec", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Osvaldo", "Last Name": "Gra\u00f1a", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Unit, Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programmes, CNIO, 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Troul\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Unit, Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programmes, CNIO, 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Espinet", "Affiliation": "Divison of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lavinia", "Last Name": "Cabras", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Carolina", "Last Name": "Navas", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Mar\u00eda Teresa", "Last Name": "Blasco", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Mart\u00edn-D\u00edaz", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Miranda", "Last Name": "Burdiel", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Zhaoqi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Mireia", "Last Name": "Vallespin\u00f3s", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Autonomous University of Madrid, 28018 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Francisco", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Bueno", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Clinical University Hospital Virgen Arrixaca, Murcian Institute of Biomedical Investigation (IMIB), 30120 Murcia, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Martin R", "Last Name": "Sprick", "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Trumpp", "Affiliation": "Divison of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bruno", "Last Name": "Sainz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Autonomous University of Madrid, 28018 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "F\u00e1tima", "Last Name": "Al-Shahrour", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Unit, Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programmes, CNIO, 28029 Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Guerra", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain; mcguerra@cnio.es mbarbacid@cnio.es."}, {"First Name": "Mariano", "Last Name": "Barbacid", "Affiliation": "Molecular Oncology, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain; mcguerra@cnio.es mbarbacid@cnio.es."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2018Feb06"}, {"PMID": "29342136", "Title": "Clonal evolution mechanisms in NT5C2 mutant-relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.", "Abstract": "Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis.

The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts.

Is there a universal statistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each category in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large, real-world datasets - including items lost and found on the New York City transit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome - and discover such an underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that randomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items and the total number of categories is quite successful in reproducing the observed abundance distributions.

The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt lymphoma. Whereas BCR ablation does not, per se, significantly affect lymphoma growth, BCR-negative (BCR-) tumour cells rapidly disappear in the presence of their BCR-expressing (BCR+) counterparts in vitro and in vivo. This requires neither cellular contact nor factors released by BCR+ tumour cells. Instead, BCR loss induces the rewiring of central carbon metabolism, increasing the sensitivity of receptor-less lymphoma cells to nutrient restriction. The BCR attenuates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) activity to support MYC-controlled gene expression. BCR- tumour cells exhibit increased GSK3\u03b2 activity and are rescued from their competitive growth disadvantage by GSK3\u03b2 inhibition. BCR- lymphoma variants that restore competitive fitness normalize GSK3\u03b2 activity after constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly through Ras mutations. Similarly, in Burkitt lymphoma, activating RAS mutations may propagate immunoglobulin-crippled tumour cells, which usually represent a minority of the tumour bulk.

Depletion of p53 reduced expression of these target genes, and analysis across 18 tumor types showed that mutation of TP53 associated with reduced expression of many of these genes. Regarding PTEN, p53 activated expression of a luciferase reporter gene containing the p53-consensus site in the PTEN enhancer, and homozygous deletion of this region in cells decreased PTEN expression and increased growth and transformation. These findings show that p53 maintains expression of a team of tumor suppressor genes that may together with the stress-induced targets mediate the ability of p53 to suppress cancer development. p53 mutations selected during tumor initiation and progression, thus, inactivate multiple tumor suppressor genes in parallel, which could account for the high frequency of p53 mutations in cancer.Implications: In this study, we investigate the activities of p53 under normal low-stress conditions and discover that p53 is capable of maintaining the expression of a group of important tumor suppressor genes at baseline, many of which are haploinsufficient, which could contribute to p53-mediated tumor suppression.

We applied scTDA to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. scTDA resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). scTDA can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "RNA", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcription, Genetic", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abbas H", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pablo G", "Last Name": "Camara", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena K", "Last Name": "Kandror", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Schieren", "Affiliation": "The Mortimer B.

"Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) accounts for the majority of S.\u00a0aureus infections globally, and yet surprisingly little is known about its clonal evolution. We applied comparative whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to epidemiologically and geographically diverse ST398-MSSA, a pandemic lineage affecting both humans and livestock. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis predicted divergence of human-associated ST398-MSSA ~40\u00a0years ago. Isolates from Midwestern pigs and veterinarians differed substantially from those in New York City (NYC). Pig ST398 strains contained a large region of recombination representing imports from multiple sequence types (STs). Phylogeographic analyses supported the spread of ST398-MSSA along local cultural and migratory links between parts of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively. Applying pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that ST398 not only clustered in households but also frequently extended across local social networks. Isolates collected from environmental surfaces reflected the full diversity of colonizing individuals, highlighting their potentially critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Strikingly, we observed high within-host SNP variability compared to our previous studies on the dominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone USA300. Our data indicate that the dynamics of colonization, persistence, and transmission differ substantially between USA300-MRSA and ST398-MSSA. Taken together, our study reveals local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone, indicating key impacts of recombination and mutation on genetic diversification and highlighting important ecological differences from epidemic USA300.

These benign tumors represent clonal hyperproliferation of melanocytes that are in a senescent-like state, but with occasional malignant transformation events. To portray the mutational repertoire of dysplastic nevi in patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome and to determine the discriminatory profiles of melanocytic nevi (including dysplastic nevi) from melanoma, we sequenced exomes of melanocytic nevi including dysplastic nevi (n\u00a0= 19), followed by a targeted gene panel (785 genes) characterization of melanocytic nevi (n\u00a0= 46) and primary melanomas (n\u00a0= 42). Exome sequencing revealed that dysplastic nevi harbored a substantially lower mutational load than melanomas (21 protein-changing mutations versus >100). Known \"driver\" mutations in genes for melanoma, including CDKN2A, TP53, NF1, RAC1, and PTEN, were not found among any melanocytic nevi sequenced.

Ancestral recombination graphs represent potential histories that explicitly accommodate recombination and mutation events across orthologous genomes. However, they are computationally costly to reconstruct, usually being infeasible for more than few tens of genomes. Recently, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods have been proposed as robust and scalable methods that can capture the genetic scale and frequency of recombination. We build upon previous TDA developments for detecting and quantifying recombination, and present a novel framework that can be applied to hundreds of genomes and can be interpreted in terms of minimal histories of mutation and recombination events, quantifying the scales and identifying the genomic locations of recombinations.

Here, we exploit one such mechanism, termed -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), to engineer ligand-responsive RNA switches that regulate protein expression. First, efficient -1 PRF stimulatory RNA elements were discovered by in vitro selection; then, ligand-responsive switches were constructed by coupling -1 PRF stimulatory elements to RNA aptamers using rational design and directed evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that -1 PRF switches tightly control the relative stoichiometry of two distinct protein outputs from a single mRNA, exhibiting consistent ligand response across whole populations of cells. Furthermore, -1 PRF switches were applied to build single-mRNA logic gates and an apoptosis module in yeast. Together, these results showcase the potential for harnessing translation-reprogramming mechanisms for synthetic biology, and they establish -1 PRF switches as powerful RNA tools for controlling protein synthesis in eukaryotes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biotechnology", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Directed Molecular Evolution", "Frameshifting, Ribosomal", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Ligands", "Protein Biosynthesis", "RNA, Fungal", "RNA, Messenger", "Riboswitch", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew V", "Last Name": "Anzalone", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annie J", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sakellarios", "Last Name": "Zairis", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature methods", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26883104", "Title": "Prognostic and therapeutic role of targetable lesions in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes.", "Abstract": "To shed light into the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia lacking known fusion transcripts, i.e. BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between children, adolescents/young adults (AYA) and adults, we analyzed 168 B-NEG ALLs by genome-wide technologies. This approach showed that B-NEG cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample. The most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to RAS/RTK (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and JAK/STAT mutations were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and NRAS mutations were more frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL cells. Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of primary cells harboring RAS and IL7R mutations.

To discover biomarkers and/or genes involved in ALK-negative ALCL pathogenesis, we applied the cancer outlier profile analysis algorithm to a gene expression profiling data set including 249 cases of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and normal T cells. Ectopic coexpression of ERBB4 and COL29A1 genes was detected in 24% of ALK-negative ALCL patients. RNA sequencing and 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends identified 2 novel ERBB4-truncated transcripts displaying intronic transcription start sites. By luciferase assays, we defined that the expression of ERBB4-aberrant transcripts is promoted by endogenous intronic long terminal repeats.

New alternative strategies for generating recombinant viruses with vaccine potential are needed. Interestingly, influenza viruses circulating in different hosts have been found to have distinct codon usage patterns, which may reflect host adaptation. We therefore hypothesized that it is possible to make a human seasonal influenza virus that is specifically attenuated in human cells but not in eggs by converting its codon usage so that it is similar to that observed from avian influenza viruses. This approach might help to generate human live attenuated viruses without affecting their yield in eggs. To test this hypothesis, over 300 silent mutations were introduced into the genome of a seasonal H1N1 influenza virus. The resultant mutant was significantly attenuated in mammalian cells and mice, yet it grew well in embryonated eggs. A single dose of intranasal vaccination induced potent innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses, and the mutant could protect mice against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. The attenuated mutant could also be used as a vaccine master donor strain by introducing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes derived from other strains.

SRSF2 mutations are frequently found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how these mutations affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease to introduce the P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates 548 splicing events (<1% of total). Of these events, 374 involved the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more-included exons and a distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more-excluded exons. RNA gel shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing UCCAG but bound less tightly to UGGAG sites. Thus in most cases the pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion correlated with stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2, i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon inclusion. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of the disease-associated SRSF2 mutation in splicing regulation and also reveal a group of misspliced mRNA isoforms for potential therapeutic targeting.", "Keywords": ["leukemia", "myelodysplastic syndromes", "pre-mRNA splicing", "serine/arginine-rich proteins", "spliceosome"], "MeSH terms": ["Binding Sites", "CRISPR-Associated Proteins", "Exons", "Humans", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "RNA", "RNA Splicing", "Ribonucleoproteins", "Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Yen K", "Last Name": "Lieu", "Affiliation": "Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Abdullah M", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Penson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn S", "Last Name": "Reggio", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Azra", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 sm3252@cumc.columbia.edu jlm2@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "James L", "Last Name": "Manley", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; sm3252@cumc.columbia.edu jlm2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2015Aug25"}, {"PMID": "25957685", "Title": "RNA exosome-regulated long non-coding RNA transcription controls super-enhancer activity.", "Abstract": "We have ablated the cellular RNA degradation machinery in differentiated B cells and pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by conditional mutagenesis of core (Exosc3) and nuclear RNase (Exosc10) components of RNA exosome and identified a vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) with emergent functionality.

The 11-subunit RNA exosome complex is the main source of cellular 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity and potentially regulates the mammalian noncoding transcriptome. Here we generated a mouse model in which the essential subunit Exosc3 of the RNA exosome complex can be conditionally deleted. Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID-mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells. Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids. We propose that RNA exosome regulation of ncRNA recruits AID to single-strand DNA-forming sites of antisense and divergent transcription in the B-cell genome, thereby creating a link between ncRNA transcription and overall maintenance of B-cell genomic integrity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Base Pairing", "Cytidine Deaminase", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA, Single-Stranded", "Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex", "Exosomes", "Female", "Genome", "Genomic Instability", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains", "Male", "Mice", "Nucleic Acid Hybridization", "RNA, Antisense", "RNA, Untranslated", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin", "Substrate Specificity", "Transcription Initiation Site", "Transcription, Genetic", "Translocation, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evangelos", "Last Name": "Pefanis", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, New York 10591, USA [3]."}, {"First Name": "Jiguang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [3]."}, {"First Name": "Gerson", "Last Name": "Rothschild", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2]."}, {"First Name": "Junghyun", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aris N", "Last Name": "Economides", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, New York 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uttiya", "Last Name": "Basu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Oct16"}, {"PMID": "25078762", "Title": "Data-driven discovery of seasonally linked diseases from an Electronic Health Records system.", "Abstract": "Patterns of disease incidence can identify new risk factors for the disease or provide insight into the etiology.

Toward this end, we studied 10 FR-CLLs by combining whole-exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA) analysis, which showed an average of 16.3 somatic mutations and 4 CNAs per sample. Screening of recurrently mutated genes in 48 additional FR-CLLs revealed that ~70% of FR-CLLs carry \u22651 mutation in genes previously associated with CLL clinical course, including TP53 (27.5%), NOTCH1 (24.1%), SF3B1 (18.9%), and BIRC3 (15.5%). In addition, this analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1 gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role.

A robust bioinformatic algorithm was established for the highly sensitive detection of few TP53 mutated cells (down to 3 out of \u223c1000 wild-type cells). Minor subclones were validated by independent approaches. Ultra-deep-NGS identified small TP53 mutated subclones in 28/309 (9%) untreated CLL that, due to their very low abundance (median allele frequency: 2.1%), were missed by Sanger sequencing. Patients harboring small TP53 mutated subclones showed the same clinical phenotype and poor survival (hazard ratio = 2.01; P = .0250) as those of patients carrying clonal TP53 lesions.

In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells.

The mechanism by which the RNA exosome recognizes immunoglobulin locus RNA substrates to stimulate AID DNA deamination activity on its in vivo substrate sequences is an important question.

First, pathogens exhibiting high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny to obtain an accurate representation of the entire population. Second, current systems of detection are nonuniform, with significant gaps in certain geographic locations and animal reservoirs. Despite past unforeseen pandemics like the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, there is no standardized way of evaluating surveillance. A more complete surveillance system should capture a greater proportion of pathogen diversity. Here we present a novel quantitative method of assessing the completeness of genomic surveillance that incorporates the time of sequence collection, as well as the pathogen's evolutionary rate. We propose the q2 coefficient, which measures the proportion of sequenced isolates whose closest neighbor in the past is within a genetic distance equivalent to 2 years of evolution, roughly the median time of changing strain selection for influenza A vaccines. Easily interpretable and significantly faster than other methods, the q2 coefficient requires no full phylogenetic characterization or use of arbitrary clade definitions. Application of the q2 coefficient to influenza A virus confirmed poor sampling of swine and avian populations and identified regions with deficient surveillance.

These findings may have relevant implications for the design of clinical trials aimed at assessing the use of mutational profiling to inform therapeutic decisions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Education, Medical, Continuing", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Phosphoproteins", "Prognosis", "RNA Splicing Factors", "Receptor, Notch1", "Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear", "Risk Factors", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it"}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Rasi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alessio", "Last Name": "Bruscaggin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Monti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmela", "Last Name": "Ciardullo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Deambrogi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Serra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Bertoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Forconi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Laurenti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Marasca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Dal-Bo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesca Maria", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pietro", "Last Name": "Bulian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Josep", "Last Name": "Nomdedeu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Del Poeta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valter", "Last Name": "Gattei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Fo\u00e0", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Dalla-Favera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gianluca", "Last Name": "Gaidano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Feb21"}]
