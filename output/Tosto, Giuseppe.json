[{"PMID": "38633769", "Title": "Genetic admixture predictors of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the South African Cape Coloured population.", "Abstract": "Ancestrally admixed populations are underrepresented in genetic studies of complex diseases, which are still dominated by European-descent populations. This is relevant not only from a representation standpoint but also because of admixed populations' unique features, including being enriched for rare variants, for which effect sizes are disproportionately larger than common polymorphisms. Furthermore, results from these populations may be generalizable to other populations. The South African Cape Coloured (SACC) population is genetically admixed, with one of the highest prevalences of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) worldwide. We profiled its admixture and examined associations between ancestry profiles and FASD outcomes using two longitudinal birth cohorts ( N =308 mothers, 280 children) designed to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development. Participants were genotyped via MEGA-ex array to capture common and rare variants. Rare variants were overrepresented in our SACC cohorts, with numerous polymorphisms being monomorphic in other reference populations (e.g., \u223c30,000 and \u223c221,000 variants in gnomAD European and Asian populations, respectively). The cohorts showed global African (51%; Bantu and San); European (26%; Northern/Western); South Asian (18%); and East Asian (5%; largely Southern regions) ancestries. The cohorts exhibited high rates of homozygosity (6%), with regions of homozygosity harboring more deleterious variants when lying within African local-ancestry genomic segments. Both maternal and child ancestry profiles were associated with FASD risk and altered severity of prenatal alcohol exposure-related cognitive deficits in the child. Our findings indicate that the SACC population may be a valuable asset to identify novel disease-associated genetic loci for FASD and other diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "R Colin", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zikun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tugba", "Last Name": "Akkaya-Hocagil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sandra W", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph L", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neil C", "Last Name": "Dodge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H Eugene", "Last Name": "Hoyme", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven H", "Last Name": "Zeisel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ernesta M", "Last Name": "Meintjes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "38405911", "Title": "Multi-omics Characterization of Epigenetic and Genetic Risk of Alzheimer Disease in Autopsied Brains from two Ethnic Groups.", "Abstract": "Both genetic variants and epigenetic features contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Genetic variations have emerged as crucial players in the etiology of AD, enabling hope for a better understanding of the disease mechanisms; yet the specific mechanism of action for those genetic variants remain uncertain. Animal models with reminiscent disease pathology could uncover previously uncharacterized roles of these genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated a knockout model for abca7, orthologous to human ABCA7 - an established AD-risk gene. The abca7 +/- zebrafish showed reduced astroglial proliferation, synaptic density, and microglial abundance in response to amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed abca7 -dependent neuronal and glial cellular crosstalk through neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling. The abca7 knockout reduced the expression of npy, bdnf and ngfra , which are required for synaptic integrity and astroglial proliferation. With clinical data in humans, we showed reduced NPY in AD correlates with elevated Braak stage, predicted regulatory interaction between NPY and BDNF , identified genetic variants in NPY associated with AD, found segregation of variants in ABCA7, BDNF and NGFR in AD families, and discovered epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of NPY, NGFR and BDNF in humans with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA7 . These results suggest that ABCA7-dependent NPY signaling is required for synaptic integrity, the impairment of which generates a risk factor for AD through compromised brain resilience.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuhao", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nastasia", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nada", "Last Name": "Kassara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruya Merve", "Last Name": "Dogru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph S", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zikun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "\u00d6zkan", "Last Name": "\u0130\u015f", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nil\u00fcfer", "Last Name": "Ertekin-Taner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan02"}, {"PMID": "38038215", "Title": "Chromosome 10q24.32 Variants Associate With Brain Arterial Diameters in Diverse Populations: A Genome-Wide Association Study.", "Abstract": "Brain arterial diameters (BADs) are novel imaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease, cognitive decline, and dementia.

prevalent in non-European ancestry groups in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We constructed and analyzed a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and ancestry-specific AD susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6,728 African American, 8,899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3,232 East Asian individuals, performing within-ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 13 loci with cross-ancestry associations including known loci at/near CR1 , BIN1 , TREM2 , CD2AP , PTK2B , CLU , SHARPIN , MS4A6A , PICALM , ABCA7 , APOE and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 ( LRRC4C ) and 12q24.13 ( LHX5-AS1 ). Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we observed the SHARPIN locus using 7.1% the sample size of the original discovering single-ancestry GWAS (n=788,989). We additionally identified three GWS ancestry-specific loci at/near ( PTPRK ( P =2.4\u00d710 -8 ) and GRB14 ( P =1.7\u00d710 -8 ) in HIS), and KIAA0825 ( P =2.9\u00d710 -8 in NHW). Pathway analysis implicated multiple amyloid regulation pathways (strongest with P adjusted =1.6\u00d710 -4 ) and the classical complement pathway ( P adjusted =1.3\u00d710 -3 ). Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development ( LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1 , and PTPRK ) and insulin receptor activity regulation ( GRB14 ).

plasticity by suppressing reactive astroglial Lcn2/Slc22a17 signaling in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Neurogenesis, crucial for brain resilience, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that induces astroglial reactivity at the expense of the pro-neurogenic potential, and restoring neurogenesis could counteract neurodegenerative pathology. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr. We suggest that enhancing pro-neurogenic astroglial fate may have therapeutic ramifications in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui",

Contrary to humans, a zebrafish can regenerate its diseased brain, and thus is ideal for studying neurogenesis. To compare the AD-related molecular pathways between humans and zebrafish, we compared single cell or nuclear transcriptomic data from a zebrafish amyloid toxicity model and its controls (N = 12) with the datasets of two human adult brains (N = 10 and N = 48 (Microglia)), and one fetal brain (N = 10). Approximately 95.4% of the human and zebrafish cells co-clustered. Within each cell type, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched KEGG pathways, and gene ontology terms. We studied synergistic and non-synergistic DEGs to point at either common or uniquely altered mechanisms across species. Using the top DEGs, a high concordance in gene expression changes between species was observed in neuronal clusters. On the other hand, the molecular pathways affected by AD in zebrafish astroglia differed from humans in favor of the neurogenic pathways. The integration of zebrafish and human transcriptomes shows that the zebrafish can be used as a tool to study the cellular response to amyloid proteinopathies. Uniquely altered pathways in zebrafish could highlight the specific mechanisms underlying neurogenesis, which are absent in humans, and could serve as potential candidates for therapeutic developments.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "adult brain", "astroglia", "fetal brain", "human", "microglia", "neuroregeneration", "single cell RNA sequencing", "single nuclear RNA sequencing", "telencephalon", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Humans", "Neurogenesis", "Solitary Nucleus", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 630 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 630 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 630 W 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2022May31"}, {"PMID": "35608697", "Title": "FMNL2 regulates gliovascular interactions and is associated with vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) during middle age and later and is frequently accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology at death. An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

Ancestry may explain these differences across ethnic groups. To this end, we studied a large cohort of Caribbean Hispanics (CH, N\u2009=\u20098813) and tested the association between Local Ancestry (LA) and LOAD (\"admixture mapping\") to identify LOAD-associated ancestral blocks, separately for ancestral components (European [EUR], African [AFR], Native American[NA]) and jointly (AFR\u2009+\u2009NA). Ancestral blocks significant after permutation were fine-mapped employing multi-ethnic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify rare variants associated with LOAD (SKAT-O) and replicated in the UK Biobank WES dataset. Candidate genes were validated studying (A) protein expression in human LOAD and control brains; (B) two animal AD models, Drosophila and Zebrafish. In the joint AFR\u2009+\u2009NA model, we identified four significant ancestral blocks located on chromosomes 1 (p value\u2009=\u20098.94E-05), 6 (p value\u2009=\u20098.63E-05), 21 (p value\u2009=\u20094.64E-05) and 22 (p value\u2009=\u20091.77E-05). Fine-mapping prioritized the GCAT gene on chromosome 22 (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20093.45E-05) and replicated in the UK Biobank (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20090.05). In LOAD brains, a decrease of 28% in GCAT protein expression was observed (p value\u2009=\u20090.038), and GCAT knockdown in Amyloid-\u03b242 Drosophila exacerbated rough eye phenotype (68% increase, p value\u2009=\u20094.84E-09). In zebrafish, gcat expression increased after acute amyloidosis (34%, p value\u2009=\u20090.0049), and decreased upon anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 (39%, p value\u2009=\u20092.3E-05). Admixture mapping uncovered genomic regions harboring new LOAD-associated loci that might explain the observed different frequency of LOAD across ethnic groups.

To study the mechanisms of pathology-induced neuro-regeneration in vertebrate brains, zebrafish is an excellent model due to its extensive neural regeneration capacity. Here, we report that Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan, negatively regulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity in adult zebrafish brain through its receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (Ahr2). The production of KYNA is suppressed after amyloid-toxicity through reduction of the levels of Kynurenine amino transferase 2 (KAT2), the key enzyme producing KYNA. NSC proliferation is enhanced by an antagonist for Ahr2 and is reduced with Ahr2 agonists or KYNA. A subset of Ahr2-expressing zebrafish NSCs do not express other regulatory receptors such as il4r or ngfra, indicating that ahr2-positive NSCs constitute a new subset of neural progenitors that are responsive to amyloid-toxicity. By performing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in three late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) brain autopsy cohorts, we also found that several genes that are components of KYNA metabolism or AHR signaling are differentially expressed in LOAD, suggesting a strong link between KYNA/Ahr2 signaling axis to neurogenesis in LOAD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "kynurenic acid",

DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE \u03b54 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "DNA methylation", "ageing", "monozygotic triplets"], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging, Premature", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoproteins E", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Jews", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Pedigree", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Triplets"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "First Rehabilitation Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Allison A", "Last Name": "Dilliott", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Roaa", "Last Name": "Khallaf", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Hegele", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Comishen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, 60 Leonard Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, 60 Leonard Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Morris", "Last Name": "Freedman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, Mt.

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families).

Linkage analysis, however, is sensitive to misspecification of marker allele frequencies. Pedigrees from recently admixed populations are particularly susceptible to this problem because of the challenge of accurately accounting for population structure. Therefore, increasing emphasis on use of multiethnic samples in genetic studies requires reevaluation of best practices, given data currently available. Typical strategies have been to compute allele frequencies from the sample, or to use marker allele frequencies determined by admixture proportions averaged over the entire sample. However, admixture proportions vary among pedigrees and throughout the genome in a family-specific manner. Here, we evaluate several approaches to model admixture in linkage analysis, providing different levels of detail about ancestral origin. To perform our evaluations, for specification of marker allele frequencies, we used data on 67 Caribbean Hispanic admixed families from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Our results show that choice of admixture model has an effect on the linkage analysis results. Variant-specific admixture proportions, computed for individual families, provide the most detailed regional admixture estimates, and, as such, are the most appropriate allele frequencies for linkage analysis. This likely decreases the number of false-positive results, and is straightforward to implement.", "Keywords": ["Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "complex trait", "large pedigrees", "late-onset disease", "missing data"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Caribbean Region", "Ethnicity", "Family", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Gene Pool", "Genetic Linkage", "Genetics, Population", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Lod Score", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Pedigree", "Phylogeny", "Principal Component Analysis", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rafael A", "Last Name": "Nafikov", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro Q", "Last Name": "Nato", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Harkirat", "Last Name": "Sohi", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Bowen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Andrea R", "Last Name": "Horimoto", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Sandra M", "Last Name": "Barral", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Timothy A", "Last Name": "Thornton", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Blue", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Ellen M", "Last Name": "Wijsman", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}], "Journal": "Genetic epidemiology", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "29742105", "Title": "White matter hyperintensities and the mediating role of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in dominantly-inherited Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on MRI is increased among presymptomatic individuals with autosomal dominant mutations for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

One possibility is that WMH promote neurodegeneration, which, in turn, affects cognition. We examined whether cortical thickness, a marker of neurodegeneration, mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition among 519 older adults. Using conditional process analysis modeling techniques, we examined the association between WMH volume and global cognition and tested whether cortical thickness mediates this relationship statistically. We also tested specific regional hypotheses to determine whether cortical thickness or volume in the medial temporal lobe mediates the relationship between WMH volume and memory. Increased total WMH volume was associated with poorer global cognition and memory. Global cortical thickness and medial temporal lobe thickness/volume mediated the relationship of WMH volume on global cognition and memory functioning. The mediating relationship was similar across racial and ethnic groups and across diagnostic groups (i.e., mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease). The findings suggest that WMH promote atrophy, which, in turn, drives cognitive decline and highlight a potential pathway in which small vessel cerebrovascular disease affects cognition by promoting neurodegenerative changes directly.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cognition", "Cortical thickness", "Memory", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Memory", "Organ Size", "Racial Groups", "Temporal Lobe", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Briana S", "Last Name": "Last", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

This ultimately results in complete incapacity and death. AD is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous disease, and this is reflected by the numerous genetic findings that point to several diverse molecular mechanisms and pathways. Linkage, genome-wide association and next-generation sequencing studies have led to the identification of more than 20 novel susceptibility loci for AD. While these observations have significantly increased the knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, a large part of the genetic component underlying AD is still unexplained. This review will summarize and discuss the major genetic findings and their potential impact on AD diagnosis and prediction of prognosis.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Epidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders", "Genetics", "Genome-wide association study", "High-throughput technologies", "Rare variants"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; The Gertrude H.

Our results confirmed the association between rs641120 and AD (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). In the MCI cohort, rs1010159 was associated with conversion to AD (HR\u200a=\u200a1.56, p\u200a=\u200a0.002).

Improved phenotyping of FAD cases may have a relevant impact both in clinical and research contexts. We performed a systematic review of studies describing the phenotypic features of FAD cases sustained by PSEN2 mutations, the less common cause of monogenic AD. Special attention was given to the clinical manifestations as well as to the main findings coming from the most commonly and widely adopted diagnostic procedures. Basing on the collected data, we also attempted to conduct a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Overall, the mutations involving the PSEN2 gene represent an extremely rare cause of FAD, having been reported to date in less than 200 cases. They are mainly associated, despite some peculiar and heterogeneous features, to a typical AD phenotype. Nevertheless, the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms may represent a potential distinctive element.
