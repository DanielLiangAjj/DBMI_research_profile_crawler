Interferons increase hematopoietic stem cells during infection by activating STAT1, but the mechanisms by which STAT1 regulates intrinsic programs in neural stem cells (NSCs) during neuroinflammation is less known. Here we explored the role of STAT1 on NSC self-renewal. We show that overexpressing Stat1 in NSCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) decreases NSC self-renewal capacity while Stat1 deletion increases NSC self-renewal, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis in isolated NSCs. Importantly, we find upregulation of STAT1 in NSCs in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and an increase in pathological T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 rather than interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the cerebrospinal fluid of affected mice. We find IFN-\u03b3 is superior to IL-17 in reducing proliferation and precipitating an abnormal NSC phenotype featuring increased STAT1 phosphorylation and Stat1 and p16ink4a gene expression. Notably, Stat1-/- NSCs were resistant to the effect of IFN-\u03b3. Lastly, we identified a Stat1-dependent gene expression profile associated with an increase in the Sox9 transcription factor, a regulator of self-renewal. Stat1 binds and transcriptionally represses Sox9 in a transcriptional luciferase assay. We conclude that Stat1 serves as an inducible checkpoint for NSC self-renewal that is upregulated during chronic brain inflammation leading to decreased self-renewal.

repressor of human monocytes.", "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine that initially was described as being pro-inflammatory and an inducer of T helper (Th)1 cells. In contrast, it has also been described as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in that it suppresses pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and induces anti-inflammatory IL-10 producing T regulatory (Tr)1 cells. While the majority of studies have been focused on the effects of IL-27 on T cells, human antigen-presenting cells express high levels of the IL-27 receptor ex vivo, in addition to being the major producer of IL-27. We report here that human monocytes are repressed by endogenous IL-27, in that the addition of an anti-IL-27 neutralizing antibody increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ex vivo. We observed that neutralizing monocyte-derived IL-27 leads to increased IL-17A production by CD4+ T cells and a down-regulation of the IL-17 modulating ectonucleotidase CD39 on monocytes. The locus that contains the IL27 gene has been linked to susceptibility for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Interestingly, ex vivo monocytes from subjects with T1D produce more IL-27 suggesting this upregulation of IL-27 acts as a negative feedback loop to attempt to counterbalance the pro-inflammatory immune response in the disease state.

The exact role of microglia in CNS disorders is not clear due to lack of tools to discriminate between microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here, we present a novel reporter mouse model targeting a microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, for studying microglia in health and disease. By placing a reporter cassette (GSG-3xFlag-P2A-tdTomato) between the coding sequence of exon 2 and 3'UTR of the Tmem119 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a Tmem119-tdTomato knock-in mouse strain. Gene expression assay showed no difference of endogenous Tmem119 in the CNS of Tmem119tdTomato/+ relative to wild-type mice. The cells expressing tdTomato were recognized by immunofluorescence staining using commercially available anti-TMEM119 antibodies. Additionally, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry techniques revealed that tdTomato+ cells are detected throughout the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues of Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Aging does not influence TMEM119 expression as tdTomato+ cells were detectable in the CNS of older mice (300 and 540\u202fdays old). Further immunofluorescence characterization shows that tdTomato+ cells colocalize with Iba1+ cells in the brain, but not with neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of brain tissues of adult mice demonstrates that the majority of microglia CD45loCD11b+ cells (96.3%) are tdTomato-positive; and a minority of infiltrating CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (5.3%) are also tdTomato-positive, which we further characterized and found that tdTomato expression is in part of choroid plexus macrophages but not in meningeal and perivascular macrophages. Functionally, using an acute injury model, we measured time-lapse activation of tdTomato-labeled microglia by transcranial two-photon microscopy in live Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Taken together, the Tmem119-tdTomato reporter mouse model is a valuable tool to specifically study the role of microglia in health and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Female", "Genes, Reporter", "Luminescent Proteins", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microglia", "Models, Animal", "Red Fluorescent Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunsheng", "Last Name": "Ruan", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linlin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Kroshilina", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lien", "Last Name": "Beckers", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Hasson", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA; Amgen Research, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We developed an in vitro cell model system composed of human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells that recapitulated key aspects of microglia phenotype and function. We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells.

Additionally, we show - by using cytometry by time of flight (CYTOF) - an increase in GrB-expressing Tregs in the peripheral blood and renal allografts of transplant recipients undergoing rejection.

These mechanisms are involved in the genesis of encephalitides in which seizures are a common complaint. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests different inflammatory responses in the brains of patients with epilepsy depending on the etiology. In general, activation of both innate and adaptive immunity plays a role in refractory forms of epilepsy. Epilepsies in which seizures develop after infiltration of cells of the adaptive immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) include a broad range of epileptic disorders with different (known or unknown) etiologies. Infiltration of lymphocytes is observed in autoimmune epilepsies, especially the classical paraneoplastic encephalitides with antibodies against intracellular tumor antigens. The presence of lymphocytes in the CNS also has been found in focal cerebral dysplasia type 2 and in cortical tubers. Various autoantibodies have been shown to be associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis of unknown etiology, which may be due to the presence of viral DNA. During the last decade, an increasing number of antineuronal autoantibodies directed against membranous epitopes have been discovered and are associated with various neurologic syndromes, including limbic encephalitis. A major challenge in epilepsy is to define biomarkers, which would allow the recognition of patient populations who might benefit from immune-modulatory therapies. Some peripheral inflammatory markers appear to be differentially expressed in patients with medically controlled and medically refractory and, as such, could be used for diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic purposes. Establishing an autoimmune basis in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy allows for efficacious and targeted immunotherapy. Although current immunotherapies can give great benefit to the correctly identified patient, there are limitations to their efficacy and they may have considerable side effects.

We recently reported a reduction in mice deficient in the Cd47 gene (Cd47-/-) CD4+ T cell adhesion and transendothelial migration (TEM) in vivo and in vitro as a result of impaired expression of high-affinity forms of LFA-1 and VLA-4 integrins. A prior study concluded that Cd47-/- mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a result of complete failure in CD4+ T cell activation after myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 aa (MOG35-55) immunization. As the prior EAE study was published before our report, authors could not have accounted for defects in T cell integrin function as a mechanism to protect Cd47-/- in EAE. Thus, we hypothesized that failure of T cell activation involved defects in LFA-1 and VLA-4 integrins. We confirmed that Cd47-/- mice were resistant to MOG35-55-induced EAE. Our data, however, supported a different mechanism that was not a result of failure of CD4+ T cell activation. Instead, we found that CD4+ T cells in MOG35-55-immunized Cd47-/- mice were activated, but clonal expansion contracted within 72 h after immunization. We used TCR crosslinking and mitogen activation in vitro to investigate the underlying mechanism. We found that na\u00efve Cd47-/- CD4+ T cells exhibited a premature block in proliferation and survival because of impaired activation of LFA-1, despite effective TCR-induced activation.

AKAP9 deficiency results in increased T cell egress to draining lymph nodes, which is associated with impaired T cell re-activation in tissues and protection from organ damage.

The recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) is a transcriptional repressor, but converts into a transcriptional activator upon activation of the canonical Notch pathway. Genome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identified a susceptibility locus, rs874040(CC), which implicated the RBPJ gene. Here, chromatin state mapping generated using the chromHMM algorithm reveals strong enhancer regions containing DNase I hypersensitive sites overlapping the rs874040 linkage disequilibrium block in human memory, but not in na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells. The rs874040 overlapping this chromatin state was associated with increased RBPJ expression in stimulated memory CD4(+) T cells from healthy subjects homozygous for the risk allele (CC) compared with memory CD4(+) T cells bearing the protective allele (GG). Transcriptomic analysis of rs874040(CC) memory T cells showed a repression of canonical Notch target genes IL (interleukin)-9, IL-17 and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 in the basal state. Interestingly, activation of the Notch pathway using soluble Notch ligand, Jagged2-Fc, induced IL-9 and IL-17A while delta-like 4Fc, another Notch ligand, induced higher IFN\u03b3 expression in the rs874040(CC) memory CD4(+) T cells compared with their rs874040(GG) counterparts. In RA, RBPJ expression is elevated in memory T cells from RA patients compared with control subjects, and this was associated with induced inflammatory cytokines IL-9, IL-17A and IFN\u03b3 in response to Notch ligation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that the rs874040(CC) allele skews memory T cells toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype involving Notch signaling, thus increasing the susceptibility to develop RA.",

We demonstrate that BCL6 is a key regulator of Th9 cell development. BCL6 expression is transiently downregulated in polarized Th9 cells, and forced expression of BCL6 in Th9 cells impairs Th9 cell differentiation. In contrast, BCL6 knockdown upregulated IL-9 production in Th9 cells. The function of BCL6 in Th9 cells is under the control of IL-2/JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that, in Th9 cells, BCL6 and STAT5 bind to adjacent motifs in the Il9 promoter. Furthermore, we found that STAT5 binding was associated with the abundance of a permissive histone mark at the Il9 promoter, whereas under conditions in which BCL6 binding was predominant, a repressive histone mark was prevalent. The effects of STAT5 and BCL6 on IL-9 transcription were further demonstrated using an IL-9 luciferase reporter assay in which BCL6 repressed STAT5-mediated Il9 transactivation. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, forced expression of BCL6 in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55-specific Th9 cells resulted in decreased IL-9 production and induction of IFN-\u03b3, causing an exacerbation of the clinical disease.

In this study, we investigated how to reduce the proinflammatory properties of IMCs and IDCs and further convert them into immune regulatory dendritic cells (DCs). We found that IL-4 and retinoic acid (RA) cotreatment of GM-CSF-differentiated IDCs synergistically induced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, a rate-limiting enzyme for RA synthesis in DCs. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs upregulated CD103 expression and markedly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon activation. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs strongly induced CD4\u207aFoxp3\u207a regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factors Stat6 and RA receptor \u03b2 play important roles in aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, induction. In addition, IL-4 and RA signaling pathways interact closely to enhance the regulatory function of treated DCs. Adoptive transfer of IL-4 plus RA-treated DCs significantly increased regulatory T cell frequency in vivo.

Accumulating evidence indicates that Notch and its ligands present on antigen-presenting cells might be important mediators of T helper cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of Jagged2 in murine cardiac transplantation by using a signaling Jagged2 mAb (Jag2) that activates recombinant signal-binding protein-J\u03ba. While administration of Jag2 mAb had little effect on graft survival in the fully allogeneic mismatched model BALB/c\u2192B6, it hastened rejection in CD28-deficient recipients. Similarly, Jag2 precipitated rejection in the bm12\u2192B6 model. In this MHC class II-mismatched model, allografts spontaneously survive for >56 days due to the emergence of Treg cells that inhibit the expansion of alloreactive T cells. The accelerated rejection was associated with upregulation of Th2 cytokines and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, despite expansion of Treg cells. Incubation of Treg cells with recombinant IL-6 abrogated their inhibitory effects in vitro. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-6 in vivo protected Jag2-treated recipients from rejection and Jagged2 signaling was unable to further accelerate rejection in the absence of Treg cells. Our findings therefore suggest that Jagged2 signaling can affect graft acceptance by upregulation of IL-6 and consequent resistance to Treg-cell suppression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Blocking", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "CD28 Antigens", "Cells, Cultured", "Graft Rejection", "Heart Transplantation", "Histocompatibility Antigens", "Interleukin-6", "Jagged-2 Protein", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Th2 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leonardo V", "Last Name": "Riella", "Affiliation": "Transplantation Research Center, Renal Division, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. lriella@rics.bwh.harvard.edu"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susanne", "Last Name": "Chock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kassem", "Last Name": "Safa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ciara N", "Last Name": "Magee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vijay", "Last Name": "Vanguri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Youmna", "Last Name": "Lahoud", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hideo", "Last Name": "Yagita", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Reza", "Last Name": "Abdi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nader", "Last Name": "Najafian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 O", "Last Name": "Medina-Pestana", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anil", "Last Name": "Chandraker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "European journal of immunology", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "22941509", "Title": "In vitro and in vivo studies of IgG-derived Treg epitopes (Tregitopes): a promising new tool for tolerance induction and treatment of autoimmunity.", "Abstract": "Tregitopes are regulatory T cell epitopes derived from immunoglobulin G (IgG) that stimulate CD25(+) FoxP3(+) T cells to expand.
