Here, we present a direct, potent, user-friendly chemical approach for optically silencing neurons. We have rendered saxitoxin (STX), a naturally occurring paralytic agent, transiently inert through chemical protection with a previously undisclosed nitrobenzyl-derived photocleavable group. Exposing the caged toxin, STX-bpc, to a brief (5\u00a0ms) pulse of light effects rapid release of a potent STX derivative and transient, spatially precise blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs). We demonstrate the efficacy of STX-bpc for parametrically manipulating action potentials in mammalian neurons and brain slice. Additionally, we show the effectiveness of this reagent for silencing neural activity by dissecting sensory-evoked swimming in larval zebrafish. Photo-uncaging of STX-bpc is a straightforward method for non-invasive, reversible, spatiotemporally precise neural silencing without the need for genetic access, thus removing barriers for comparative research.", "Keywords": ["actional potential", "electrophysiology", "photocage", "saxitoxin", "sodium channel", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna V", "Last Name": "Elleman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, 333 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikola", "Last Name": "Milicic", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 121 Integrative Biology Research Building, 1117 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Damian J", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "Simko", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine J", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, Jerome L.

To further investigate the relationship between altered SCN8A function and epilepsy, we introduced the SCN1A-R1648H mutation, identified in a family with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), into the corresponding position (R1627H) of the mouse Scn8a gene. Heterozygous R1627H mice exhibited increased resistance to some forms of pharmacologically and electrically induced seizures and the mutant Scn8a allele ameliorated the phenotype of Scn1a-R1648H mutants. Hippocampal slices from heterozygous R1627H mice displayed decreased bursting behavior compared to wild-type littermates. Paradoxically, at the homozygous level, R1627H mice did not display increased seizure resistance and were susceptible to audiogenic seizures. We furthermore observed increased hippocampal pyramidal cell excitability in heterozygous and homozygous Scn8a-R1627H mutants, and decreased interneuron excitability in heterozygous Scn8a-R1627H mutants.
