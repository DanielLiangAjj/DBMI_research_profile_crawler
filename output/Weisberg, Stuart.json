We found evidence of pancreatic inflammation in patients with CPI-DM with shrinkage of pancreases, increased pancreatic enzymes, and in a case from a patient who died with CPI-DM, peri-islet lymphocytic infiltration. In the NOD mouse model, anti-PD-L1 but not anti-CTLA-4 induced diabetes rapidly. RNA sequencing revealed that cytolytic IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells infiltrated islets with anti-PD-L1. Changes in \u03b2 cells were predominantly driven by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and included induction of a potentially novel \u03b2 cell population with transcriptional changes suggesting dedifferentiation. IFN-\u03b3 increased checkpoint ligand expression and activated apoptosis pathways in human \u03b2 cells in vitro. Treatment with anti-IFN-\u03b3 and anti-TNF-\u03b1 prevented CPI-DM in anti-PD-L1-treated NOD mice. CPIs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway resulted in transcriptional changes in \u03b2 cells and immune infiltrates that may lead to the development of diabetes.

While immunotherapies have been beneficial with many different types of solid tumors, they have almost uniformly failed in the treatment of PDAC. Understanding how therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can provide insights for the development of strategies to treat PDAC. We used quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescence (qmIF) quantitative spatial analysis (qSA), and immunogenomic (IG) analysis to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 44 patients with PDAC including 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and 26 patients receiving no treatment (NT) and compared them with tissues from 40 treatment-na\u00efve melanoma patients. We find that relative to NT tumors, CD3+ T cell infiltration was increased in CRT treated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0006), including increases in CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs, p =\u00a0.0079), CD3+CD4+FOXP3- T helper cells (Th, p =\u00a0.0010), and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs, p =\u00a0.0089) with no difference in CD68+ macrophages. IG analysis from micro-dissected tissues indicated overexpression of genes involved in antigen presentation, T cell activation, and inflammation in CRT treated tumors. Among treated patients, a higher ratio of Tregs to total T cells was associated with shorter survival time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0121). Despite comparable levels of infiltrating T cells in CRT PDACs to melanoma, PDACs displayed distinct spatial profiles with less T cell clustering as defined by nearest neighbor analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These findings demonstrate that, while CRT can achieve high T cell densities in PDAC compared to melanoma, phenotype and spatial organization of T cells may limit benefit of T cell infiltration in this immunotherapy-resistant tumor.", "Keywords": ["T regulatory cells", "Tumor microenvironment", "biomarkers", "tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Gartrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Enzler", "Affiliation": "Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ladan", "Last Name": "Fazlollahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew X", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanna E", "Last Name": "Minns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Subha", "Last Name": "Perni", "Affiliation": "Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart P", "Last Name": "Weisberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuelle M", "Last Name": "Rizk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eun Jeong", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinzheng V", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Codruta", "Last Name": "Chiuzan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Bates", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chabot", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Schrope", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kluger", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabad\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Remotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne M", "Last Name": "Saenger", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35446789", "Title": "Immune and epithelial determinants of age-related risk and alveolar injury in fatal COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is characterized by widespread disruption of the lung's alveolar gas exchange interface.

We found marked loss of type 2 alveolar epithelial (T2AE) cells and increased perialveolar lymphocyte cytotoxicity in all fatal COVID-19 cases, even at early stages before typical patterns of acute lung injury are histologically apparent. In lungs from uninfected organ donors, there was also progressive loss of T2AE cells with increasing age, which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19-mediated lung damage in older individuals. In the fatal COVID-19 cases, macrophage infiltration differed according to the histopathological pattern of lung injury. In cases with acute lung injury, we found accumulation of CD4+ macrophages that expressed distinctly high levels of T cell activation and costimulation genes and strongly correlated with increased extent of alveolar epithelial cell depletion and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.

Individually, these therapies also have an effect on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Evaluating the combination effect of these three therapies on the TIME can help determine when combination therapy is most appropriate for further study. In this study, we use a transgenic murine melanoma model (Tyr::CreER; BRAFCA/+; PTENflox/flox), to evaluate the TIME in response to combinations of BRAFi, anti-PD1, and OncoVEXmGMCSF. We find that mice treated with the triple combination BRAFi\u2009+\u2009anti-PD1\u2009+\u2009OncoVEXmGMCSF have decreased tumor growth compared to BRAFi alone and prolonged survival compared to control.

Assessing virus-neutralizing activity of human serum to monitor population immunity and response to infection and vaccination is key to pandemic control. We developed a virus neutralization platform strategy that relies only on bioinformatic and genetic information of the virus of interest. The platform uses viral envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to set up an assay that mimics multicycle infection but is safe and, therefore, amenable to biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions for viruses that require BSL3 facilities (e.g., SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2).

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their severe manifestations have largely been studied in circulation. Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T\u00a0cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T\u00a0cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163+ monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli. High levels of myeloid chemoattractants in airways suggest recruitment of these cells through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis.

They are also a critically important component of host defense, protecting against invading pathogens. However, the effects on macrophage biology of acutely ingesting large numbers of RBCs are not completely understood. To investigate this issue, we used a mouse model of RBC transfusion and clearance, which mimics the clinical setting. In this model, transfusions of refrigerator storage-damaged (ie, \"old\") RBCs led to increased erythrophagocytosis by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). This robust erythrophagocytosis induced ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, in RPMs. This was accompanied by increases in reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in vivo, which were reduced by treatment in vitro with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Old RBC transfusions also induced RPM-dependent chemokine expression by splenic Ly6Chi monocytes, which signaled Ly6Chi monocyte migration from bone marrow to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of cell division among remaining splenic RPMs, along with the influx of bone marrow-derived Ly6Chi monocytes, suggests that, following RPM depletion induced by robust erythrophagocytosis, there is a coordinated effort to restore homeostasis of the RPM population by local self-maintenance and contributions from circulating monocytes.

abdominal pain is total pancreatectomy (TP) followed by islet autotransplantation (IAT) to prevent the development of brittle diabetes. In adult patients, narcotic independence is achieved in up to 73% of patients 1 to 5 years after transplantation whereas insulin independence is achieved in up to 40% of patients 1 to 2 years after transplantation. Pediatric patients have shown similar outcomes for narcotic independence (up to 79%) but better outcomes for insulin independence (up to 56% 1 year after transplantation). The quality of life of both adult and pediatric patients improved significantly after TP-IAT using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 survey. IAT after pancreatectomy is also performed for patients with benign and malignant disease of the pancreas. The limited studies in this patient population suggest that IAT may be potentially beneficial for carefully selected patients when sufficient numbers of islet cells can be isolated. Further studies involving a larger number of patients are needed to determine the risks and benefits of IAT in patients with malignancy. The feasibility of IAT depends on the availability of a laboratory that can isolate the pancreatic islet cells. An on-site laboratory is the traditional model; however, remote processing of pancreatic islets has been reported to result in successful outcomes.

Hh-induced tumors arise from various tissues and they may be indolent or aggressive, as is the case with skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cerebellar medulloblastoma, respectively. Little is known about common cell-intrinsic factors that control the development of such diverse Hh-dependent tumors. Transcription factor Zfx is required for the self-renewal of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells, as well as for the propagation of acute myeloid and T-lymphoblastic leukemias. We report here that Zfx facilitates the development of experimental BCC and medulloblastoma in mice initiated by deletion of the Hh inhibitory receptor Ptch1. Simultaneous deletion of Zfx along with Ptch1 prevented BCC formation and delayed medulloblastoma development. In contrast, Zfx was dispensable for tumorigenesis in a mouse model of glioblastoma. We used genome-wide expression and chromatin-binding analysis in a human medulloblastoma cell line to characterize direct, evolutionarily conserved targets of Zfx, identifying Dis3L and Ube2j1 as two targets required for the growth of the human medulloblastoma cells. Our results establish Zfx as a common cell-intrinsic regulator of diverse Hh-induced tumors, with implications for the definition of new therapeutic targets in these malignancies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Carcinoma, Basal Cell", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cerebellar Neoplasms", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Male", "Medulloblastoma", "Mice, Knockout", "Patched Receptors", "Patched-1 Receptor", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Ribonucleases", "Signal Transduction", "Skin Neoplasms", "Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Colin J", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose M", "Last Name": "Galan-Caridad", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stuart P", "Last Name": "Weisberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose M", "Last Name": "Esquilin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Hematology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gist F", "Last Name": "Croft", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology, Neurology and Neuroscience, and Project A.L.S./Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Wainwright", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) originate from different lineages through distinct oncogenic events such as MLL fusions and Notch signaling, respectively. We found that Zfx, a transcription factor that controls hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, controls the initiation and maintenance of AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx prevents differentiation and activates gene sets characteristic of immature cells of the respective lineages. In addition, endogenous Zfx contributes to gene induction and transformation by Myc overexpression in myeloid progenitors. Key Zfx target genes include the mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescues the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML.
