[{"PMID": "38767413", "Title": "CHD2 Regulates Neuron-glioma Interactions in Pediatric Glioma.", "Abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shoufu",

affecting the midline structures of the central nervous system. Despite decades of clinical trials, treatment remains limited to palliative radiation therapy. A major challenge is the coexistence of molecularly distinct malignant cell states with potentially orthogonal drug sensitivities. To address this challenge, we leveraged established network-based methodologies to elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic, non-oncogene dependencies of seven coexisting subpopulations identified by single-cell analysis-whose enrichment in essential genes was validated by pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Perturbational profiles of 372 clinically relevant drugs helped identify those able to invert the activity of subpopulation-specific MRs for follow-up in vivo validation.

Based on a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data containing ten clinical datasets of HNSCC and matched nonmalignant samples, we identified SERPINE1/MMP3/COL1A1/SPP1 as essential hub genes as the potential theranostic biomarkers. Our analysis suggests these hub genes are associated with the extracellular matrix, peptidoglycans, cell migration, wound-healing processes, complement and coagulation cascades, and the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway within the tumor microenvironment. Also, these hub genes were associated with tumor-immune infiltrating cells and immunosuppressive phenotypes of HNSCC. Further investigation of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts revealed that these hub genes were associated with staging, metastasis, and poor survival in HNSCC patients. Molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate binding activities between the hub genes and antrocinol, a novel small-molecule derivative of an anticancer phytochemical antrocin previously discovered by our group.

SMARCA4 colocalizes with SOX10 at gene regulatory elements to control the expression of genes involved in cell growth and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, SMARCA4 chromatin binding is reduced upon depletion of SOX10 or H3.3K27M, a mutation occurring in about 60% DMG tumors.

A syngeneic orthotopic model was developed by stereotactic injection of PDGF-B+PTEN-/-p53-/- murine glioma cells into the pons of B6 mice. A single-element, spherical-segment 1.5\u00a0MHz ultrasound transducer driven by a function generator through a power amplifier was used with concurrent intravenous microbubble injection for tumor sonication. Mice were randomly assigned to control, FUS and double-FUS groups. Pulse and respiratory rates were continuously monitored during treatment. BBB opening was confirmed with gadolinium-enhanced MRI and Evans blue. Kondziela inverted screen testing and sequential weight lifting measured motor function before and after sonication. A subset of animals were treated with etoposide following ultrasound. Mice were either sacrificed for tissue analysis or serially monitored for survival with daily weights. FUS successfully caused BBB opening while preserving normal cardiorespiratory and motor function. Furthermore, the degree of intra-tumoral hemorrhage and inflammation on H&E in control and treated mice was similar. There was also no difference in weight loss and survival between the groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Lastly, FUS increased intra-tumoral etoposide concentration by more than fivefold. FUS is a safe and feasible technique for repeated BBB opening and etoposide delivery in a preclinical pontine glioma model.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biological Transport", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain Stem", "Brain Stem Neoplasms", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Etoposide", "Evans Blue", "Gadolinium", "Glioma", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Pons", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zachary K", "Last Name": "Englander", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hong-Jian", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonios N", "Last Name": "Pouliopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ethan", "Last Name": "Bendau", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavan", "Last Name": "Upadhyayula", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Ing", "Last Name": "Jan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanora F", "Last Name": "Spinazzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Yoh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masih", "Last Name": "Tazhibi", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas M", "Last Name": "McQuillan", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tony J C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Feldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stergios", "Last Name": "Zacharoulis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa E", "Last Name": "Konofagou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheng-Chia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. cw2666@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Mar22"}, {"PMID": "33346092", "Title": "Focused Ultrasound-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Increases Delivery and Efficacy of Etoposide for Glioblastoma Treatment.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease.

GBMs eventually relapse after treatment and the average survival of GBM patients is less than two years. There is some evidence that cannabidiol (CBD) can induce cell death and increases the radiosensitivity of GBM by enhancing apoptosis. Beside initiation of death, CBD has been demonstrated as an inducer of autophagy. In the present study, we address the question whether CBD simultaneously induces a protective effect in GBM by upregulating autophagy. Addition of chloroquine that suppressed autophagic flux to 2D GBM cultures increased CBD-induced cell death, presenting proof for the protective autophagy. Blockage of autophagy upregulated radiation-induced cytotoxicity but only modestly affected the levels of cell death in CBD- or CBD/\u03b3-irradiated 3D GBM cultures. Furthermore, CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby changing a balance between cell death and survival. Suppression of JNK activation partially reduced CBD-induced cell death in 3D GBM cultures. In contrast, co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of PI3K-AKT-NF-\u03baB, IKK-NF-\u03baB or JAK2-STAT3 pathways killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures, potentially improving the therapeutic ratio of GBM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cannabidiol", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Janus Kinase 2", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Radiation Tolerance", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vladimir N", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. vni3@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter W", "Last Name": "Grabham", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheng-Chia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom K", "Last Name": "Hei", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Feb14"}, {"PMID": "32034917", "Title": "Estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 discordance between primary tumor and brain metastases in breast cancer and its effect on treatment and survival.", "Abstract": "Breast cancer treatment is based on estrogen receptors (ERs), progesterone receptors (PRs), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).

Our group previously published a prognostic index, the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) for GI cancer patients with BM, based on 209 patients diagnosed from 1985-2005. The purpose of this analysis is to identify prognostic factors for GI cancer patients with newly diagnosed BM in a larger contemporary cohort. A multi-institutional retrospective IRB-approved database of 792 GI cancer patients with new BM diagnosed from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2016 was created. Demographic data, clinical parameters, and treatment were correlated with survival and time from primary diagnosis to BM (TPDBM). Kaplan-Meier median survival (MS) estimates were calculated and compared with log-rank tests. The MS from time of first treatment for BM for the prior and current cohorts were 5 and 8 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Eight prognostic factors (age, stage, primary site, resection of primary tumor, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), extracranial metastases, number of BM and Hgb were found to be significant for survival, in contrast to only one (KPS) in the prior cohort. In this cohort, the most common primary sites were rectum (24%) and esophagus (23%). Median TPDBM was 22 months. Notably, 37% (267/716) presented with poor prognosis (GPA 0-1.0). Although little improvement in overall survival in this cohort has been achieved in recent decades, survival varies widely and multiple new prognostic factors were identified. Future work will translate these factors into a prognostic index to facilitate clinical decision-making and stratification of future clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul W", "Last Name": "Sperduto", "Affiliation": "Minneapolis Radiation Oncology and University of Minnesota Gamma Knife Center.

While gliosarcoma may represent a distinct clinical entity given its unique histologic composition and molecular features, its relative prognostic significance remains uncertain. While treatment of gliosarcoma generally encompasses the same standardized approach used in glioblastoma, supporting evidence is limited given its rarity. Here, we characterized 32 cases of gliosarcoma and retrospectively evaluated survival relative to 451 glioblastoma patients diagnosed during the same era within the same institution. Overall, we identified 22 primary gliosarcomas, representing 4.7% of WHO Grade IV primary glioblastomas, and 10 secondary gliosarcomas. With median age of 62, patients were predominately Caucasian (87.5%) and male (65.6%). Tumors with available molecular profiling were primarily MGMT-unmethylated (87.5%), IDH-1-preserved (100%) and EGFR wild-type (100%). Interestingly, while no significant median survival difference between primary gliosarcoma and glioblastoma was observed across the entire cohort (11.0 vs. 14.8 months, p\u2009=\u20090.269), median survival was worse for gliosarcoma specifically among patients who received modern temozolomide-based (TMZ) chemoradiotherapy (11.0 vs. 17.3 months, p\u2009=\u20090.006).

We retrospectively identified BM patients who received surgical resection and SRS for BM from an IRB approved database between Jan 2009-Aug 2015. Patients were stratified into two groups: ARS and ARD. LC was determined by follow-up MRI studies and OS was measured from the date of surgery.

Later trials have shown the feasibility of using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) instead. But vaginal movement between fractions is concerning when using IMRT due to greater conformality of the isodose curves to the target and the resulting possibility of missing the target while the vagina is displaced. In this study, we showed that the use of a rectal balloon during treatment can decrease vaginal displacement, limit rectal dose, and limit acute and late toxicities. Little is known regarding the use of a rectal balloon (RB) in treating patients with IMRT in the posthysterectomy setting. We hypothesize that the use of an RB during treatment can limit rectal dose and acute and long-term toxicities, as well as decrease vaginal cuff displacement between fractions. We performed a retrospective review of patients with gynecological malignancies who received postoperative IMRT with the use of an RB from January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2015. Rectal dose constraint was examined as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 1203 and 0418. Daily cone beam computed tomography (CT) was performed, and the average (avg) displacement, avg magnitude, and avg magnitude of vector were calculated. Toxicity was reported according to RTOG acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Acute toxicity was defined as less than 90 days from the end of radiation treatment. Late toxicity was defined as at least 90 days after completing radiation. Twenty-eight patients with postoperative IMRT with the use of an RB were examined and 23 treatment plans were reviewed.

The avg vector magnitude was 6.60\u2009\u00b1\u20094.14\u2009mm. For acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, 50% experienced grade 1 toxicities and 18% grade 2 GI toxicities. For acute genitourinary (GU) toxicities, 21% had grade 1 and 18% had grade 2 toxicities. For late GU toxicities, 7% had grade 1 and 4% had grade 2 toxicities.

The purpose of this study was to measure dose to the LG in WBRT and determine methods for reducing radiation exposure.

Biologically effective dose (BED) conversions with an \u03b1/\u03b2 of 3 for normal parotid were performed to compare with 10-fraction and 15-fraction treatments of WBRT.

Repeat positron emission tomography-computed tomography at 32 months after the right neck dissection revealed no evidence of disease. The present study also discusses the current preclinical in vitro and in vivo targets for HPV-positive HNSCC and the obstacles presented in advancing clinical treatment modalities. Previous preclinical models investigating radiation sensitivity have yielded mixed results. Thus, it is important to understand and establish representative preclinical models for studying HPV and HNSCC to improve clinical research and therapeutic development.
