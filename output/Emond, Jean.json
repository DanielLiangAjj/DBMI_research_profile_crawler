[{"PMID": "38914281", "Title": "International Multicenter Study of Ultra-Low GRWR Grafts in Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation.", "Abstract": "Decreasing the graft size in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) increases the risk of early allograft dysfunction. Graft-to-recipient-weight-ratio (GRWR) of 0.8 is considered the threshold. There is evidence that smaller volume grafts may also provide equally good outcomes, the cut-off of which remains unknown. In this retrospective multi-center study, 92 adult LDLT with a final GRWR<=0.6 performed at 12 international liver transplant (LT) centers over a 3-year period were included. Perioperative data including preoperative status, portal flow hemodynamics (PFH) and portal flow modulation (PFM), development of SFSS, morbidity and mortality was collated and analyzed. Thirty-two (36.7%) patients developed SFSS and this was associated with increased 30-day, 90-day and one-year mortality. Pre-operative MELD and inpatient status were independent predictors for SFSS (p<0.05). Pre-LT renal dysfunction was an independent predictor of survival (Hazard ratio- 3.1;95% ci 1.1,8.9, p=0.035). PFH or PFM were not predictive of SFSS or survival. We report the largest ever multi-center study of LDLT outcomes using ultralow-GRWR grafts and for the first-time validate the ILTS-iLDLT-LTSI consensus definition and grading of SFSS. Pre-operative recipient condition rather than GRWR and PFH were independent predictors of SFSS. Algorithms to predict SFSS and LT outcomes should incorporate recipient factors along with GRWR.", "Keywords": ["Living Donor Liver Transplantation", "Outcomes", "Predictors", "Ultra-low GRWR"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mettu S", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "Gleneagles Global Hospital & Health City, Chennai, India.

Key risk factors for bile leaks included multiple bile duct anastomoses (odds ratio, [OR] 1.8), Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (OR, 1.4), and a history of major abdominal surgery (OR, 1.4). For biliary anastomotic strictures, risk factors were ABO incompatibility (OR, 1.4), blood loss >1 L (OR, 1.4), and previous abdominal surgery (OR, 1.7). Patients experiencing biliary complications had extended hospital stays, increased incidence of major complications, and higher comprehensive complication index scores. The impact on graft survival became evident after accounting for immortal time bias using time-dependent covariate survival analysis. Bile leaks and biliary anastomotic strictures were associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.7 and 1.8 for graft survival, respectively. The study underscores the importance of minimizing these risks through careful donor selection and preoperative planning, as biliary complications significantly affect graft survival, despite the availability of effective treatments.", "Keywords": ["bile leak", "biliary anastomotic stricture", "biliary complications", "liver transplantation", "living-donor liver transplantation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhihao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Transplantation, Swiss HPB Center, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland; Multi-Organ Transplant Program, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ashwin", "Last Name": "Rammohan", "Affiliation": "The Institute of Liver Disease and Transplantation, Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Vasanthakumar", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "The Institute of Liver Disease and Transplantation, Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Suyoung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Itsuko", "Last Name": "Chih-Yi Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Jongman", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Kris Ann", "Last Name": "Hervera Marquez", "Affiliation": "Organ Transplant Center of Excellence, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Shih-Chao", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Organ Transplantation Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Elvan Onur", "Last Name": "Kirimker", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}, {"First Name": "Nobuhisa", "Last Name": "Akamatsu", "Affiliation": "Artificial Organ and Transplantation Division and Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Oren", "Last Name": "Shaked", "Affiliation": "Division of Transplantation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Finotti", "Affiliation": "Division of Abdominal Transplantation, Annette C. and Harold C.

to 20% developing this following living donor LT (LDLT). Preventing SFSS involves consideration of factors before the surgical procedure, including donor and recipient selection, and factors during the surgical procedure, including adequate outflow reconstruction, graft portal inflow modulation, and management of portosystemic shunts. International Liver Transplantation Society, International Living Donor Liver Transplantation Group, and Liver Transplant Society of India Consensus Conference was convened in January 2023 to develop recommendations for the prediction and management of SFSS in LDLT. The format of the conference was based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. International experts in this field were allocated to 4 working groups (diagnosis, prevention, anesthesia, and critical care considerations, and management of established SFSS). The working groups prepared evidence-based recommendations to answer-specific questions considering the currently available literature. The working group members, independent panel, and conference attendees served as jury to edit and confirm the final recommendations presented at the end of the conference by each working group separately. This report presents the final statements and evidence-based recommendations provided by working group 2 that can be implemented to prevent SFSS in LDLT patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Living Donors", "Syndrome", "India", "Liver"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abdul Rahman", "Last Name": "Hakeem", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Liver Transplant Surgery, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Johns Shaji", "Last Name": "Mathew", "Affiliation": "Department of GI, HPB & Multi-Organ Transplant, Rajagiri Hospitals, Kochi, India."}, {"First Name": "Carmen Vinaixa", "Last Name": "Aun\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "Hepatolog\u00eda y Trasplante Hep\u00e1tico, Servicio de Medicina Digestiva, Hospital Universitario y Polit\u00e9cnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Mazzola", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Unit\u00e9 M\u00e9dicale de Transplantation H\u00e9patique, H\u00e9pato-gastroent\u00e9rologie, AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Felipe", "Last Name": "Alconchel", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Transplantation, Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital, Murcia, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Young-In", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Giuliano", "Last Name": "Testa", "Affiliation": "Department of Abdominal Transplantation, Annette C. and Harold C.

Twenty-five percent of the programs reported \"frequently\" facilitating a second opinion for a declined inpatient, 52% of the programs reported \"sometimes\" doing so, and 7% of the programs reported never doing so. One hundred percent of the programs reported that they receive referrals for second opinions. Twenty-five percent of the programs reported transplanting these referrals frequently (over 20% of the time). Neither program size nor program location statistically impacted the findings. When asked if centers would be in favor of standardizing the evaluation process, 38% of centers would be in favor, 39% would be opposed, and 23% were unsure.

The American Society of Transplantation organized a virtual consensus conference in October 2021 to identify barriers and gaps to LDLT growth, and to provide evidence-based recommendations to foster safe expansion of LDLT in the United States. This article reports the findings and recommendations regarding innovations and advances in approaches to donor-recipient matching challenges, the technical aspects of the donor and recipient operations, and surgical training. Among these themes, the barriers deemed most influential/detrimental to LDLT expansion in the United States included: (1) prohibitive issues related to donor age, graft size, insufficient donor remnant, and ABO incompatibility; (2) lack of acknowledgment and awareness of the excellent outcomes and benefits of LDLT; (3) ambiguous messaging regarding LDLT to patients and hospital leadership; and (4) a limited number of proficient LDLT surgeons across the United States. Donor-recipient mismatching may be circumvented by way of liver paired exchange. The creation of a national registry to generate granular data on donor-recipient matching will guide the practice of liver paired exchange. The surgical challenges to LDLT are addressed herein and focuses on the development of robust training pathways resulting in proficiency in donor and recipient surgery. Utilizing strong mentorship/collaboration programs with novel training practices under the auspices of established training and certification bodies will add to the breadth and depth of training.", "Keywords": ["ABO Incompatible", "living donor liver transplantation", "living paired exchanges", "surgical training"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Blood Group Incompatibility", "Liver Transplantation", "Living Donors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Sturdevant", "Affiliation": "University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Swaytha", "Last Name": "Ganesh", "Affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Samstein", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Davalos", "Affiliation": "Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vineeta", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Comprehensive Transplant Institute, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marwan", "Last Name": "Abouljoud", "Affiliation": "Henry Ford Transplant Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oya", "Last Name": "Andacoglu", "Affiliation": "University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma, Oklahoma, USA."}, {"First Name": "Medhat", "Last Name": "Askar", "Affiliation": "Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Broering", "Affiliation": "King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Juliet", "Last Name": "Emamaullee", "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine E", "Last Name": "Haugen", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle T", "Last Name": "Jesse", "Affiliation": "Henry Ford Transplant Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mureo", "Last Name": "Kasahara", "Affiliation": "National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "AnnMarie", "Last Name": "Liapakis", "Affiliation": "Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Transplant Center, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Mandelbrot", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anjana", "Last Name": "Pillai", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Garrett R", "Last Name": "Roll", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nazia", "Last Name": "Selzner", "Affiliation": "Ajmera Transplant Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sukru", "Last Name": "Emre", "Affiliation": "University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "AST LDLT Consensus Conference Working Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Clinical transplantation", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37019173", "Title": "Novel Noninvasive Biomarkers in Liver Transplantation: A Tool on the Doorstep of Clinical Utilization.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers have the potential to transform the detection, treatment, and outcomes of liver transplant complications, though their application is limited because of the lack of prospective validation.

While immunotherapies have been beneficial with many different types of solid tumors, they have almost uniformly failed in the treatment of PDAC. Understanding how therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can provide insights for the development of strategies to treat PDAC. We used quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescence (qmIF) quantitative spatial analysis (qSA), and immunogenomic (IG) analysis to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 44 patients with PDAC including 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and 26 patients receiving no treatment (NT) and compared them with tissues from 40 treatment-na\u00efve melanoma patients. We find that relative to NT tumors, CD3+ T cell infiltration was increased in CRT treated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0006), including increases in CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs, p =\u00a0.0079), CD3+CD4+FOXP3- T helper cells (Th, p =\u00a0.0010), and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs, p =\u00a0.0089) with no difference in CD68+ macrophages. IG analysis from micro-dissected tissues indicated overexpression of genes involved in antigen presentation, T cell activation, and inflammation in CRT treated tumors. Among treated patients, a higher ratio of Tregs to total T cells was associated with shorter survival time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0121). Despite comparable levels of infiltrating T cells in CRT PDACs to melanoma, PDACs displayed distinct spatial profiles with less T cell clustering as defined by nearest neighbor analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These findings demonstrate that, while CRT can achieve high T cell densities in PDAC compared to melanoma, phenotype and spatial organization of T cells may limit benefit of T cell infiltration in this immunotherapy-resistant tumor.", "Keywords": ["T regulatory cells", "Tumor microenvironment", "biomarkers", "tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Gartrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Enzler", "Affiliation": "Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin T", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ladan", "Last Name": "Fazlollahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew X", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanna E", "Last Name": "Minns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Subha", "Last Name": "Perni", "Affiliation": "Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart P", "Last Name": "Weisberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuelle M", "Last Name": "Rizk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eun Jeong", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinzheng V", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Codruta", "Last Name": "Chiuzan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Bates", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Chabot", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Schrope", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kluger", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabad\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Remotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne M", "Last Name": "Saenger", "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "34954339", "Title": "Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Autoimmune Hepatitis - A Nationwide Population-based Cohort Study With Histopathology.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver condition that predominantly affects women.

Patient with Cystic Fibrosis.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) constituted approximately 10% of organ transplants in 2019, with the majority of transplants consisting of bilateral lung transplant. Multiorgan transplantation in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) is rare, and usually involves the liver and lung combined. Since kidney disease is not a common sequela of CF, the need for renal transplant in individuals who have not previously undergone lung transplant is uncommon. CASE REPORT We report a case of successful liver-lung-kidney transplant in a 23-year-old man with CF-related liver and lung disease, who developed renal failure due to IgA nephropathy. He required renal replacement therapy during the months before transplantation. After discussions among the liver, lung, and renal transplant teams, the patient was listed for multiorgan transplantation. An appropriate single donor for all organs was identified, and the patient underwent transplantation. The patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) perioperatively, with total operative time of 23 h and 1 min. Postoperative course was notable for hemothorax and medication-induced acute tubular necrosis, which resolved without the need for renal replacement therapy. Liver and lung graft function was normal at 6 months, and renal function was minimally reduced. CONCLUSIONS Triple organ transplantation in CF is a viable option for individuals with multiorgan failure who may otherwise not qualify for single/dual organ transplantation. Use of ECMO and CRRT can be necessary during the long operative procedure. Optimal immunosuppression protocols for this group of patients has not yet been established, and ethical concerns regarding multiorgan transplantation exist.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Humans", "Kidney Transplantation", "Liver", "Lung", "Lung Transplantation", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey", "Last Name": "Dube", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lorna", "Last Name": "Dove", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy C", "Last Name": "McLaughlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd", "Last Name": "Rattner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "D'Ovidio", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "DiMango", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "The American journal of case reports", "PubDate": "2021Jun24"}, {"PMID": "34033607", "Title": "Autologous Stem Cell Transplant to Treat Recurrent Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: Tolerance, But at What Price?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cholangitis, Sclerosing", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Liver Transplantation", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Transplantation, Autologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Griesemer", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2022Mar01"}, {"PMID": "34015454", "Title": "Transplant Surgery Pipeline: A Report from the American Society of Transplant Surgeons Pipeline Taskforce.", "Abstract": "Transplant surgery fellowship has evolved over the years and today there are 66 accredited training programs in the US and Canada.

recipients with confirmed infection.", "Abstract": "It remains uncertain whether immunocompromised patients including solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients will have a robust antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled all adult SOT recipients at our center with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent antibody testing with a single commercially available anti-nucleocapsid antibody test at least 7\u00a0days after diagnosis in a retrospective cohort. Seventy SOT recipients were studied (56% kidney, 19% lung, 14% liver \u00b1 kidney, and 11% heart \u00b1 kidney recipients). Thirty-six (51%) had positive anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing, and 34 (49%) were negative. Recipients of a kidney allograft were less likely to have positive antibody testing compared to those who did not receive a kidney (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). In the final multivariable model, the years from transplant to diagnosis (OR 1.26, p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and baseline immunosuppression with more than two agents (OR 0.26, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) were significantly associated with the antibody test result, controlling for kidney transplantation. In conclusion, among SOT recipients with confirmed infection, only 51% of patients had detectable anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and transplant-related variables including the level and nature of immunosuppression were important predictors. These findings raise the concern that SOT recipients with COVID-19 may be less likely to form SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "antibodies", "serology", "transplant"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "COVID-19", "Humans", "Organ Transplantation", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "SARS-CoV-2", "Transplant Recipients"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Burack", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marcus R", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Demetra S", "Last Name": "Tsapepas", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Harren", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maryjane A", "Last Name": "Farr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Selim", "Last Name": "Arcasoy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eldad A", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Verna", "Affiliation": "Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33277801", "Title": "Retrospective-prospective study of safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir-based direct-acting antivirals in HIV/HCV-coinfected participants with decompensated liver disease pre- or post-liver transplant.", "Abstract": "Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has transformed the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C (HCV) coinfected patients with advanced liver disease.

Sixty-eight participants with end-stage liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score \u22657 and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 6-29) were enrolled, 26 had hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-two participants were treated pre-LT and 26 post-LT. All participants completed therapy without need for dose reduction or transfusion; eight required two or more courses of therapy. Ninety-three percent achieved a sustained virologic response and DAA therapy was well tolerated. Despite HCV cure, 12 end-stage liver disease participants required subsequent LT, 7 for decompensated liver disease. Thirteen participants died, 10 with decompensated liver disease pre-LT and three post-LT. Overall, transplant free survival was 42.8% at 4\u00a0years and post-LT survival was 87.9% at 5\u00a0years.

This study aimed at developing an intention-to-treat model through a competing-risk analysis. Using data available at first referral, an upper limit of tumor burden for downstaging was identified beyond which successful LT becomes an unrealistic goal. Twelve centers in Europe, United States, and Asia (Brussels, Sapienza Rome, Padua, Columbia University New York, Innsbruck, Medanta-The Medicity Dehli, Hong Kong, Kyoto, Kaohsiung Taiwan, Mainz, Fukuoka, Shulan Hospital Hangzhou) created a Derivation (n = 2318) and a Validation Set (n = 773) of HCC patients listed for LT between January2000-March 2017. In the Derivation Set, the competing-risk analysis identified two independent covariables predicting post-transplant HCC-related death: combined HCC number and diameter (SHR = 1.15; p < 0.001) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (SHR = 1.80; p < 0.001). WE-DS Model showed good diagnostic performances at internal and external validation. The identified upper limit of tumor burden for downstaging was AFP \u2264 20 ng/mL and up-to-twelve as sum of HCC number and diameter; AFP = 21-200 and up-to-ten; AFP = 201-500 and up-to-seven; AFP = 501-1000 and up-to-five. The WE-DS Model proposed here, based on morphologic and biologic data obtained at first referral in a large international cohort of HCC patients listed for LT, allowed identifying an upper limit of tumor burden for downstaging beyond which successful LT, following downstaging, results in a futile transplantation.", "Keywords": ["MELD", "Metroticket 2.0", "alpha-fetoprotein", "disease progression", "loco-regional therapy", "mRECIST"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Quirino", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Vitale", "Affiliation": "Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplant Unit, University of Padua, 35121 Padua, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Karim", "Last Name": "Halazun", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuele", "Last Name": "Iesari", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9", "Last Name": "Viveiros", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Prashant", "Last Name": "Bhangui", "Affiliation": "Medicine Medanta-The Medicity, Guragram, Dehli 122006, India."}, {"First Name": "Gianluca", "Last Name": "Mennini", "Affiliation": "Hepatobiliary and Organ Transplantation Unit, Sapienza University, 00161 Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 852, China."}, {"First Name": "Shinji", "Last Name": "Uemoto", "Affiliation": "Division of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic and Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto 615-8530, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Chih-Che", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 33305, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Mittler", "Affiliation": "Klinik f\u00fcr Allgemein-, Viszeral- und Transplantationschirurgie Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Mainz, 76726 Mainz, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Toru", "Last Name": "Ikegami", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 819-0395, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Zhe", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery Shulan Hospital, Shulan Health Zhejiang University Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, China."}, {"First Name": "Shu-Sen", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery Shulan Hospital, Shulan Health Zhejiang University Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuji", "Last Name": "Soejima", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 819-0395, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Hoppe-Lotichius", "Affiliation": "Klinik f\u00fcr Allgemein-, Viszeral- und Transplantationschirurgie Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Mainz, 76726 Mainz, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Chao-Long", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 33305, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Toshimi", "Last Name": "Kaido", "Affiliation": "Division of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic and Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto 615-8530, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Chung Mau", "Last Name": "Lo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 852, China."}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Hepatobiliary and Organ Transplantation Unit, Sapienza University, 00161 Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Arvinder Singh", "Last Name": "Soin", "Affiliation": "Medicine Medanta-The Medicity, Guragram, Dehli 122006, India."}, {"First Name": "Armin", "Last Name": "Finkenstedt", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Umberto", "Last Name": "Cillo", "Affiliation": "Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplant Unit, University of Padua, 35121 Padua, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Lerut", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, 1200 Brussels, Belgium."}], "Journal": "Cancers", "PubDate": "2020Feb14"}, {"PMID": "31753606", "Title": "Exploring Medical Students' Perceptions of Organ Procurement: Need for a Formalized Medical Student Curriculum.", "Abstract": "We evaluated the medical student experience with a deceased-donor multiorgan procurement program at a single center.

Trans-organ paired exchanges would enable a donor associated with a kidney recipient to donate a lobe of liver and a donor associated with a liver recipient to donate a kidney. This article explores some of the ethical concerns that trans-organ exchange might encounter including unbalanced donor risks, the validity of informed consent, and effects on deceased organ donation.", "Keywords": ["donor hepatectomy", "donor nephrectomy", "donors and donation: paired exchange", "ethics", "ethics and public policy", "kidney transplantation/nephrology", "liver transplantation/hepatology"], "MeSH terms": ["Directed Tissue Donation", "Humans", "Kidney Transplantation", "Liver Transplantation", "Tissue Donors", "Tissue and Organ Procurement"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Samstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Inmaculada", "Last Name": "de Melo-Martin", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Ethics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, , USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandip", "Last Name": "Kapur", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd", "Last Name": "Ratner", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "29404284", "Title": "Pretreatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio: useful prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT) are the only curative modalities for HCC. Despite recent advances and the adoption of the Milan and University of California, San Francisco, criteria, HCC recurrence after LR and LT remains a challenge. Several markers and prognostic scores have been proposed to predict tumor aggressiveness and supplement radiological data; among them, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has recently gained significant interest. An elevated NLR is thought to predispose to HCC recurrence by creating a protumorigenic microenvironment through both relative neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia. In the present review, we attempted to summarize the published work on the role of pretreatment NLR as a prognostic marker for HCC following LR and LT. A total of 13 LT and 18 LR studies were included from 2008 to 2015. Pretransplant NLR was most often predictive of HCC recurrence, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival.

Patients without cirrhosis with PVT suffer from presinusoidal portal hypertension, and often hepatic atrophy is a topic that has received little attention. We hypothesized that patients with PVT have decreased liver volumes, and shunts that preserve intrahepatic portal flow enhance liver regeneration. Sixty-four adult and pediatric patients with PVT who underwent surgical shunt placement between 1998 and 2011 were included in a retrospective study. Baseline liver volumes from adult patients were compared with standard liver volume (SLV) as well as a group of healthy controls undergoing evaluation for liver donation. Clinical assessment, liver function tests, and liver and spleen volumes from cross-sectional imaging were compared before and after surgery. A total of 40 patients received portal flow-preserving shunts (32 mesoportal and 8 selective splenorenal), whereas 24 received portal flow-diverting shunts (16 nonselective splenorenal and 8 mesocaval). Baseline adult liver volumes were 26% smaller than SLV (1248 versus 1624 cm3 ; P = 0.02) and 20% smaller than the control volumes (1248 versus 1552 cm3 ; P = 0.02). Baseline adult spleen volumes were larger compared with controls (1258 versus 229 cm3 ; P < 0.001). Preserving shunts were associated with significant increase in liver volumes (886 versus 1131 cm3 ; P = 0.01), whereas diverting shunts were not. Diverting shunts significantly improved splenomegaly. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that patients without cirrhosis with PVT have significant liver atrophy and splenomegaly. Significant liver regeneration was achieved after portal flow-preserving shunts.

We examined the influence of anatomic variation and reconstruction techniques on surgical outcomes and graft survival in the 9-center Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). Data from 272 adult LDLT recipients (2011-2015) included details on anatomic characteristics and types of intraoperative biliary reconstruction. Associations were tested between reconstruction technique and complications, which included first biliary complication (BC; leak, stricture, or biloma) and first vascular complication (VC; hepatic artery thrombosis [HAT] or portal vein thrombosis [PVT]). Time to patient death, graft failure, and complications were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and tested with log-rank tests. Median posttransplant follow-up was 1.2 years. Associations were found between the type of biliary reconstruction and the incidence of VC (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and BC (P\u2009=\u20090.05). Recipients with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy had the highest probability of VC. Recipients with biliary reconstruction involving the use of high biliary radicals on the recipient duct had the highest likelihood of developing BC (56% by 1 year) compared with duct-to-duct (42% by 1 year). In conclusion, the varied surgical approaches in the A2ALL centers offer a novel opportunity to compare disparate LDLT approaches. The choice to use higher biliary radicals on the recipient duct for reconstruction was associated with more BC, possibly secondary to devascularization and ischemia. The use of Roux-en-Y biliary reconstruction was associated with VCs (HAT and PVT). These results can be used to guide biliary reconstruction decisions in the setting of anatomic variants and inform further improvements in LDLT reconstructions. Ultimately, this information may contribute to a lower incidence of technical complications after LDLT.

No previous study has evaluated APOLT specifically for preadolescent children with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). This population might benefit especially based on greater capacity for liver regeneration. Data from 13 preadolescent children who underwent APOLT were compared to 13 matched controls who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for FHF from 1996 to 2013. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or survival between the 2 groups. However, all surviving OLT recipients (10/13) remain on ISP, while all but 1 surviving APOLT recipient (12/13) showed native liver regeneration, and the first 10 recipients (76.9%) are currently off ISP with 2 additional patients currently weaning. In our experience, APOLT produced excellent survival and high rates of native liver regeneration in preadolescent children with FHF. This represents the largest series to date to report such outcomes. Liberating these children from lifelong ISP without the downside of increased surgical morbidity makes APOLT an attractive alternative. In conclusion, we therefore propose that, with the availability of technical expertise and with the technical modifications above, APOLT for FHF should be strongly considered for preteenage children with FHF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Infant", "Liver", "Liver

following living donor liver transplantation.", "Abstract": "Following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT; and unlike deceased donor liver transplantation [DDLT]), the liver must rapidly regenerate, and sometimes segmental graft dysfunction (SGD) is observed. Hepatic regeneration requires substantial de novo lipid synthesis, and we previously reported that expression of lipid-related genes is dysregulated in LDLT. Here, we compare serum lipid measurements in 41 LDLT recipients and 43 DDLT recipients at baseline and at serial posttransplant time points. In addition, we examined whether serum lipid/apolipoprotein (apo) levels correlate with the degree of liver regeneration (measured using percent volume increase [%VI] at 3 months) or SGD in LDLT recipients. In contrast to DDLT, lipid levels declined early after LDLT but returned to baseline by 30 days. The odds ratio (OR) for achieving robust regeneration (>90 %VI) was 2.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-5.52) for every 1\u2009mg/dL increase in serum apoE at 30 days. The OR of SGD for every year increase in donor age was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.02-1.39), and 0.61 for every 1\u2009mg/dL increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 7 days (95% CI, 0.34-1.11). No associations were detected between preoperative serum lipids/apos in LDLT donors and SGD or %VI in recipients. In conclusion, we suggest that initiation of regeneration prevents the liver from participating fully in lipid transport and metabolism. Inability to meet systemic metabolic needs may result in compromised liver function and SGD.

We hypothesized an etiologic association between altered platelet counts and postdonation splenomegaly and sought to explore this relationship. This study analyzed de-identified computed tomography/magnetic resonance scans of 388 donors from 9 Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study centers read at a central computational image analysis laboratory. Resulting liver and spleen volumes were correlated with time-matched clinical laboratory values. Predonation liver volumes varied 2-fold in healthy subjects, even when they were normalized by the body surface area (BSA; range\u2009=\u2009522-1887 cc/m(2) , n\u2009=\u2009346). At month 3 (M3), postdonation liver volumes were, on average, 79% of predonation volumes [interquartile range (IQR)\u2009=\u200973%-86%, n\u2009=\u2009165] and approached 88% at year 1 (Y1; IQR\u2009=\u200980%-93%, n\u2009=\u200975). The mean spleen volume before donation was 245 cc (n\u2009=\u2009346). Spleen volumes greater than 100% of the predonation volume occurred in 92% of donors at M3 (n\u2009=\u2009165) and in 88% at Y1 after donation (n\u2009=\u200975). We sought to develop a standard spleen volume (SSV) model to predict normal spleen volumes in donors before donation and found that decreased platelet counts, a younger age, a higher predonation liver volume, higher hemoglobin levels, and a higher BSA predicted a larger spleen volume (n\u2009=\u2009344, R(2) \u2009=\u20090.52). When this was applied to postdonation values, some large volumes were underpredicted by the SSV model. Models developed on the basis of the reduced sample of postdonation volumes yielded smaller underpredictions. These findings confirm previous observations of thrombocytopenia being associated with splenomegaly after donation. The results of the SSV model suggest that the biology of this phenomenon is complex.

Potential predictors of 3-month liver volume included total and standard liver volumes (TLV and SLV), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (in recipients), the remnant and graft size, remnant-to-donor and graft-to-recipient weight ratios (RDWR and GRWR), remnant/TLV, and graft/SLV. Among donors, 3-month absolute growth was 676\u2009\u00b1\u2009251 g (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD), and percentage reconstitution was 80%\u2009\u00b1\u200913%.

We analyzed 6,160 HCC patients who received exception points in regions 3, 5, 9, and 10 from 2002 to 2012. Data from regions 5 and 9 were combined and compared to data from regions 3 and 10. Survival was studied in three patient cohorts: an intent-to-treat cohort, a posttransplant cohort, and a cohort examining overall survival in transplanted patients only (survival from listing to last posttransplant follow-up). Multivariate analysis and log-rank testing were used to analyze the data. Median time on the list in the LWTR was 7.6 months compared to 1.6 months for SWTR, with a significantly higher incidence of death on the waiting list in LWTR than in SWTR (8.4% versus 1.6%, P < 0.0001).

Increasing temperature usually results in accelerated loss of quality and shelf-life reduction, which is not physically visible until too late in the supply chain to adjust logistics to match shelf life. A blackberry study showed that temperatures inside pallets varied significantly and 57% of the berries arriving at the packinghouse did not have enough remaining shelf life for the longest supply routes. Yet, the advanced shelf-life loss was not physically visible. Some of those pallets would be sent on longer supply routes than necessary, creating avoidable waste. Other studies showed that variable pre-cooling at the centre of pallets resulted in physically invisible uneven shelf life. We have shown that using simple temperature measurements much waste can be avoided using 'first expiring first out'. Results from our studies showed that shelf-life prediction should not be based on a single quality factor as, depending on the temperature history, the quality attribute that limits shelf life may vary. Finally, methods to use air temperature to predict product temperature for highest shelf-life prediction accuracy in the absence of individual sensors for each monitored product have been developed.

In this single-center, retrospective study, the ability of the international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), physiological Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and serum albumin levels within 7 days after LT to predict 90-day mortality or graft loss was compared with 2 previously used definitions of EAD: (1) peak total bilirubin level >10 mg/dL on days 2 to 7 and (2) either a total bilirubin level >10 mg/dL or an INR >1.6 on day 7 or an AST or alanine aminotransferase level >2000 IU/L within the first 7 days. Of 572 enrolled LT patients 38 died or required retransplantation within 90 days. Peak INR, total bilirubin level, AST levels, and MELD scores were predictors of 90-day graft failure.

This study has demonstrated that the MELD score can be a useful tool not only for pretransplant graft allocation but also for postoperative risk stratification.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alanine Transaminase", "Aspartate Aminotransferases", "Bilirubin", "End Stage Liver Disease", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "ROC Curve", "Retrospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gebhard", "Last Name": "Wagener", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. gw72@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Raffel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Moury", "Last Name": "Minhaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23545507", "Title": "Prevention of de novo hepatitis B in recipients of core antibody-positive livers with lamivudine and other nucleos(t)ides: a 12-year experience.", "Abstract": "Lamivudine (LAM) has been shown to prevent de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in recipients of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive liver transplants (LT) but primarily in small studies with limited follow-up.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenine", "Adult", "Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Antiviral Agents", "Biomarkers", "Chi-Square Distribution", "DNA, Viral", "Donor Selection", "Female", "Guanine", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B Antibodies", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Hepatitis B virus", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Lamivudine", "Liver Transplantation", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organophosphonates", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Tenofovir", "Time Factors", "Tissue Donors", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endoscopy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonja K", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elsa M", "Last Name": "Pichardo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica B", "Last Name": "Stiles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Rosenthal-Cogan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William D", "Last Name": "Brubaker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James V", "Last Name": "Guarrera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Transplantation", "PubDate": "2013Apr15"}, {"PMID": "23536483", "Title": "Prevention of de novo hepatitis B with adefovir plus vaccination in recipients of liver transplants from core antibody-positive donors.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenine", "Adult", "Aged", "Antiviral Agents", "Biomarkers", "DNA, Viral", "Deoxycytidine", "Drug Substitution", "Emtricitabine", "Guanine", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B Antibodies", "Hepatitis B Core Antigens", "Hepatitis B Vaccines", "Hepatitis B virus", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Middle Aged", "Organophosphonates", "Tenofovir", "Time Factors", "Tissue Donors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sonja K", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elsa M", "Last Name": "Pichardo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Heese", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica B", "Last Name": "Stiles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James V", "Last Name": "Guarrera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean C", "Last Name": "Emond", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23340706", "Title": "Complex hepatectomy under total vascular exclusion of the liver: impact of ischemic preconditioning on clinical outcomes.", "Abstract": "Hepatic inflow clamping during hepatectomy introduces ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and many authors regard the addition of caval occlusion as adding increased risk.
