[{"PMID": "38750041", "Title": "A multi-institutional meningioma MRI dataset for automated multi-sequence image segmentation.", "Abstract": "Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radiologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, and radiation oncologists rely on brain MRI for diagnosis, treatment planning, and longitudinal treatment monitoring. However, automated, objective, and quantitative tools for non-invasive assessment of meningiomas on multi-sequence MR images are not available. Here we present the BraTS Pre-operative Meningioma Dataset, as the largest multi-institutional expert annotated multilabel meningioma multi-sequence MR image dataset to date. This dataset includes 1,141 multi-sequence MR images from six sites, each with four structural MRI sequences (T2-, T2/FLAIR-, pre-contrast T1-, and post-contrast T1-weighted) accompanied by expert manually refined segmentations of three distinct meningioma sub-compartments: enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and surrounding non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Basic demographic data are provided including age at time of initial imaging, sex, and CNS WHO grade. The goal of releasing this dataset is to facilitate the development of automated computational methods for meningioma segmentation and expedite their incorporation into clinical practice, ultimately targeting improvement in the care of meningioma patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Meningioma", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Male", "Female", "Image

"Abstract": "Activity-based training and lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) have the potential to restore standing and walking with self-balance assistance after motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI). However, improvements in upright postural control have not previously been addressed in this population. Here, we implemented a novel robotic postural training with scES, performed with free hands, to restore upright postural control in individuals with chronic, cervical (n\u2009=\u20095) or high-thoracic (n\u2009=\u20091) motor complete SCI, who had previously undergone stand training with scES using a walker or a standing frame for self-balance assistance. Robotic postural training re-enabled and/or largely improved the participants' ability to control steady standing, self-initiated trunk movements and upper limb reaching movements while standing with free hands, receiving only external assistance for pelvic control. These improvements were associated with neuromuscular activation pattern adaptations above and below the lesion. These findings suggest that the human spinal cord below the level of injury can generate meaningful postural responses when its excitability is modulated by scES, and can learn to improve these responses. Upright postural control improvements can enhance functional motor recovery promoted by scES after severe SCI.", "Keywords": ["epidural stimulation", "postural control", "spinal cord injury", "standing", "training"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Enrico", "Last Name": "Rejc", "Affiliation": "Tim and Caroline Reynolds Center for Spinal Stimulation, Kessler Foundation, West Orange, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Collin", "Last Name": "Bowersock", "Affiliation": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanvi", "Last Name": "Pisolkar", "Affiliation": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isirame", "Last Name": "Omofuma", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Luna", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Moiz", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology at BWH, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Santamaria", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beatrice", "Last Name": "Ugiliweneza", "Affiliation": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia A", "Last Name": "Angeli", "Affiliation": "Tim and Caroline Reynolds Center for Spinal Stimulation, Kessler Foundation, West Orange, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gail F", "Last Name": "Forrest", "Affiliation": "Tim and Caroline Reynolds Center for Spinal Stimulation, Kessler Foundation, West Orange, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sunil", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan J", "Last Name": "Harkema", "Affiliation": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}], "Journal": "Neurotrauma reports", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38514232", "Title": "Innovations in Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Recovery of Function"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Stilling", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital, 525 East 68th Street, Baker Pavilion, F-1602, New York, NY 10065, USA.

With our novel design of a mobile Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (mTPAD) paired with the DeepSole system to predict the user's gait cycle percentage, we demonstrate how to apply three-dimensional forces on the pelvis without lower limb constraints. This work is the first result in the literature that shows that with an applied lateral force during affected limb stance, the center of pressure trajectory's lateral symmetry is significantly closer to a 0% symmetry (5.5%) than without external force applied (-9.8%,p<0.05). Furthermore, the affected limb's maximum relative pressure (p) significantly increases from 233.7p to 234.1p (p<0.05) with an applied downward force, increasing affected limb loading.

Moreover, our algorithm is able to predict both future intra- and inter-stride gait phases, offering a potential means to improve wearable device controller performance. The proposed data-driven algorithm is based on a dataset consisting of 5 able-bodied subjects and validated on 3 different able-bodied subjects. Under unrhythmic activity situations, validation shows that the algorithm can accurately identify multiple activities with 99.55% accuracy, and estimate ([Formula: see text]: 6.3%) and predict 200-ms-ahead ([Formula: see text]: 8.6%) the gait phase percentage in real time, which are on average 57.7 and 54.0% smaller than the error from the event-based method in the same conditions. This study showcases a solution to estimate and predict gait status for multiple unrhythmic activities, which may be deployed to controllers for wearable robots or health monitoring devices.", "Keywords": ["Activities classification", "Artificial neural networks", "Exoskeleton", "Gait phase detection"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Gait", "Walking", "Lower Extremity", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Algorithms", "Movement Disorders", "Biomechanical Phenomena"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shuangyue", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics (BIRO), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianfu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics (BIRO), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tzu-Hao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics (BIRO), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junxi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics (BIRO), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Visco", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Farah", "Last Name": "Hameed", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xianlian", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07102, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics (BIRO), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA. hao.su796@ncsu.edu."}], "Journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "36646837", "Title": "Neuronal activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus enhances emotional memory encoding.", "Abstract": "Emotional events comprise our strongest and most valuable memories. Here we examined how the brain prioritizes emotional information for storage using direct brain recording and deep brain stimulation. First, 148 participants undergoing intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recording performed an episodic memory task. Participants were most successful at remembering emotionally arousing stimuli. High-frequency activity (HFA), a correlate of neuronal spiking activity, increased in both the hippocampus and the amygdala when participants successfully encoded emotional stimuli. Next, in a subset of participants (N\u2009=\u200919), we show that applying high-frequency electrical stimulation to the hippocampus selectively diminished memory for emotional stimuli and specifically decreased HFA. Finally, we show that individuals with depression (N\u2009=\u200919) also exhibit diminished emotion-mediated memory and HFA. By demonstrating how direct stimulation and symptoms of depression unlink HFA, emotion and memory, we show the causal and translational potential of neural activity in the amygdalohippocampal circuit for prioritizing emotionally arousing memories.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Emotions", "Mental Recall", "Hippocampus", "Amygdala", "Brain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Salman E", "Last Name": "Qasim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. salman.qasim@mssm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Uma R", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature human behaviour", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "35832507", "Title": "Thumb Stabilization and Assistance in a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Post-Stroke Hemiparesis.", "Abstract": "We propose a dual-cable method of stabilizing the thumb in the context of a hand orthosis designed for individuals with upper extremity hemiparesis after stroke.

To determine whether a phase III trial comparing home aerobic to balance training in ambulatory patients with cerebellar ataxia is warranted, we conducted a single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Nineteen subjects were randomized to aerobic training and 17 subjects to balance training. The primary outcome was improvement in ataxia as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Secondary outcomes included safety, training adherence, and balance improvements. There were no differences between groups at baseline. Thirty-one participants completed the trial, and there were no training-related serious adverse events. Compliance to training was over 70%. There was a mean improvement in ataxia symptoms of 1.9 SARA points (SD 1.62) in the aerobic group compared to an improvement of 0.6 points (SD 1.34) in the balance group. Although two measures of balance were equivocal between groups, one measure of balance showed greater improvement with balance training compared to aerobic training. In conclusion, this 6-month trial comparing home aerobic versus balance training in cerebellar ataxia had excellent retention and adherence to training. There were no serious adverse events, and training was not interrupted by minor adverse events like falls or back pain. There was a significant improvement in ataxia symptoms with home aerobic training compared to balance training, and a phase III trial is warranted.

Much research has examined how the MTL neurally represents spatial information, such as with \"place cells\" that represent an animal's current location or \"head-direction cells\" that code for an animal's current heading. In addition to behaviors that require an animal to attend to the current spatial location, navigating to remote destinations is a common part of daily life. To examine the neural basis of these behaviors, we recorded single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing Treasure Hunt, a virtual-reality spatial-memory task. By analyzing how the activity of these neurons related to behavior in Treasure Hunt, we found that the firing rates of many MTL neurons during navigation significantly changed depending on the position of the current spatial target. In addition, we observed neurons whose firing rates during navigation were tuned to specific heading directions in the environment, and others whose activity changed depending on the timing within the trial.

Rate of growth per year increased in both groups for each measure but to a greater degree in the NECC vs Non-NECC regions: PSC/CSC (5.4%/yr vs 3.2%/yr), GWTG-S participation (5.0%/yr vs 2.9%/yr), and PAAs (5.2%/yr vs 2.1%/yr), with state-based certification growth also being higher in the NECC region (4.2%/yr vs 0.4%/yr; all comparisons p < 0.0001). After adjusting for year, significantly more NECC hospitals had PSC/CSC certification, GWTG-S participation, and GWTG-S PAAs than non-NECC sites (all analyses p < 0.0001). One hundred percent of NECC region DOHs were aware of the NECC and involved in functions, 87.5% indicated the NECC provided beneficial assistance. Conclusions: There has been a higher rate of growth of state certification contrasted to national PSC/CSC certification, and a higher rate of growth of participation and achievement in GWTG-S in the northeast region compared to other US regions.", "Keywords": ["Stroke", "Stroke Center Certification", "Systems of Care"], "MeSH terms": ["Certification", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Stroke", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charles R", "Last Name": "Wira", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT."}, {"First Name": "Shannon", "Last Name": "Melluzzo", "Affiliation": "American Stroke Association, Waltham, MA."}, {"First Name": "T Mark", "Last Name": "Beasley", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL."}, {"First Name": "Zainab", "Last Name": "Magdon-Ismail", "Affiliation": "American Stroke Association, Albany NY."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Day", "Affiliation": "American Stroke Association, Albany NY."}, {"First Name": "Tracy E", "Last Name": "Madsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI."}, {"First Name": "Louise D", "Last Name": "McCullough", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas at Houston, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Lee H", "Last Name": "Schwamm", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Toby", "Last Name": "Gropen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NorthEast Cerebrovascular Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Yale journal of biology and medicine", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31712776", "Title": "Memory retrieval modulates spatial tuning of single neurons in the human entorhinal cortex.", "Abstract": "The medial temporal lobe is critical for both spatial navigation and memory.

Methods- Twelve outpatient US rehabilitation centers enrolled participants between May 2014 and December 2015. We delivered 1 Hz active or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to noninjured motor cortex before each of eighteen 60-minute therapy sessions over a 6-week period, with outcomes measured at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months after end of treatment. The primary end point was the percentage of participants improving \u22655 points on upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score 6 months after end of treatment. Secondary analyses assessed changes on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test and Wolf Motor Function Test and safety. Results- Of 199 participants, 167 completed treatment and follow-up because of early discontinuation of data collection. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer gains were significant for experimental ( P<0.001) and sham groups ( P<0.001). Sixty-seven percent of the experimental group (95% CI, 58%-75%) and 65% of sham group (95% CI, 52%-76%) improved \u22655 points on 6-month upper extremity Fugl-Meyer ( P=0.76). There was also no difference between experimental and sham groups in the Action Research Arm Test ( P=0.80) or the Wolf Motor Function Test ( P=0.55). A total of 26 serious adverse events occurred in 18 participants, with none related to the study or device, and with no difference between groups. Conclusions- Among patients 3 to 12 months poststroke, goal-oriented motor rehabilitation improved motor function 6 months after end of treatment.

Here we examine the specific cognitive processes implemented by MTL structures (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) to organize memory by using electrical brain stimulation, leveraging its ability to establish causal links between brain regions and features of behavior. We studied neurosurgical patients of both sexes who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order. During the spatial task, MTL stimulation impaired subjects' abilities to remember items located far away from boundaries. These stimulation effects were specific to the MTL. Our findings thus provide the first causal demonstration in humans of the specific memory processes that are performed by the MTL to encode when and where events occurred.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in encoding spatial and temporal memories, but they have not been able to causally demonstrate the nature of the cognitive processes by which this occurs in real-time. Electrical brain stimulation is able to demonstrate causal links between a brain region and a given function with high temporal precision.

"29467145", "Title": "Electrophysiological Signatures of Spatial Boundaries in the Human Subiculum.", "Abstract": "Environmental boundaries play a crucial role in spatial navigation and memory across a wide range of distantly related species. In rodents, boundary representations have been identified at the single-cell level in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation. Although studies of hippocampal function and spatial behavior suggest that similar representations might exist in humans, boundary-related neural activity has not been identified electrophysiologically in humans until now. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the hippocampal formation of surgical epilepsy patients (of both sexes) while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task and compared the power in three frequency bands (1-4, 4-10, and 30-90 Hz) for target locations near and far from the environmental boundaries. Our results suggest that encoding locations near boundaries elicited stronger theta oscillations than for target locations near the center of the environment and that this difference cannot be explained by variables such as trial length, speed, movement, or performance. These findings provide direct evidence of boundary-dependent neural activity localized in humans to the subiculum, the homolog of the hippocampal subregion in which most boundary cells are found in rodents, and indicate that this system can represent attended locations that rather than the position of one's own body.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spatial computations using environmental boundaries are an integral part of the brain's spatial mapping system. In rodents, border/boundary cells in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex reveal boundary coding at the single-neuron level. Although there is good reason to believe that such representations also exist in humans, the evidence has thus far been limited to functional neuroimaging studies that broadly implicate the hippocampus in boundary-based navigation. By combining intracranial recordings with high-resolution imaging of hippocampal subregions, we identified a neural marker of boundary representation in the human subiculum.", "Keywords": ["boundary", "cognitive map", "human subiculum", "intracranial EEG", "navigation", "theta oscillations"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Spatial Navigation", "Theta Rhythm"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sang Ah", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34141, Korea, sangah.lee@kaist.ac.kr joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan F", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Watrous", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Sperling", "Affiliation": "Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107."}, {"First Name": "Ashwini", "Last Name": "Sharan", "Affiliation": "Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Worrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55902."}, {"First Name": "Brent M", "Last Name": "Berry", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55902."}, {"First Name": "Joshua P", "Last Name": "Aronson", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn A", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322."}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Lega", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235."}, {"First Name": "Sameer", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, and."}, {"First Name": "Sandhitsu R", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Joel M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Gorniak", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107."}, {"First Name": "Daniel S", "Last Name": "Rizzuto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, sangah.lee@kaist.ac.kr joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Mar28"}, {"PMID": "29076760", "Title": "Aspirin is an effective pretreatment for exercise in multiple sclerosis: A double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial.", "Abstract": "Exercise benefits multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but exercise-induced overheating is a deterrent for many.

This error reduction model, while beneficial for skill acquisition, could be detrimental for long-term retention. Error augmentation (EA) models have been explored as alternatives. A robotic Tethered Pelvic Assist Device has been developed to study force application to the pelvis on gait and was used here to induce weight shift onto the paretic (error reduction) or nonparetic (error augmentation) limb during treadmill training. The purpose of these case reports is to examine effects of training with these two paradigms to reduce load force asymmetry during gait in two individuals after stroke (>6 mos). Participants presented with baseline gait asymmetry, although independent community ambulators. Participants underwent 1-hr trainings for 3 days using either the error reduction or error augmentation model. Outcomes included the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale for treatment tolerance and measures of force and stance symmetry. Both participants tolerated training. Force symmetry (measured on treadmill) improved from pretraining to posttraining (36.58% and 14.64% gains), however, with limited transfer to overground gait measures (stance symmetry gains of 9.74% and 16.21%). Training with the Tethered Pelvic Assist Device device proved feasible to improve force symmetry on the treadmill irrespective of training model. Future work should consider methods to increase transfer to overground gait.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Body Weight", "Exercise Therapy", "Female", "Gait", "Gait Disorders, Neurologic", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pelvis", "Robotics", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Treatment Outcome", "Weight-Bearing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauri", "Last Name": "Bishop", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York (LB, LQ, JS, SA); Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Programs in Movement Science & Kinesiology, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York (LB, LQ); Department of Mechanical Engineering, Robotics and Rehabilitation Lab, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, New York (MK, DM, SA); and Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York (JS)."}, {"First Name": "Moiz", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dario", "Last Name": "Martelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sunil", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28536658", "Title": "Understanding the Connection between Cognitive Impairment and Mobility: What Can Be Gained from Neuropsychological Assessment?", "Abstract": "The ability of neuropsychological tests to predict rehabilitation outcome is unclear, particularly when other ratings of cognition are available.

However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models.

Recent intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) work has shown that hippocampal activity during encoding predicts subsequent temporal organization of memories [3], supporting a role in contextual binding. It is an open question, however, whether the hippocampus similarly supports contextually mediated processes during retrieval. Here, we analyzed iEEG recordings obtained from 215 epilepsy patients as they performed a free recall task. To identify neural activity specifically associated with contextual retrieval, we compared correct recalls, intrusions (incorrect recall of either items from prior lists or items not previously studied), and deliberations (matched periods during recall when no items came to mind). Neural signals that differentiate correct recalls from both other retrieval classes reflect contextual retrieval, as correct recalls alone arise from the correct context. We found that in the\u00a0hippocampus, high-frequency activity (HFA, 44-100\u00a0Hz), a proxy for neural activation [4], was greater prior to correct recalls relative to the other retrieval classes, with no differentiation between intrusions and deliberations.

Gamma frequency activity can be recorded directly from the human brain using intracranial electrodes implanted in patients undergoing treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Previous studies have independently explored narrowband oscillations in the local field potential and broadband power increases. It is not clear, however, which processes contribute to human brain gamma frequency activity, or their dynamics and roles during memory processing. Here a large dataset of intracranial recordings obtained during encoding of words from 101 patients was used to detect, characterize and compare induced gamma frequency activity events. Individual bursts of gamma frequency activity were isolated in the time-frequency domain to determine their spectral features, including peak frequency, amplitude, frequency span, and duration. We found two distinct types of gamma frequency activity events that showed either narrowband or broadband frequency spans revealing characteristic spectral properties. Narrowband events, the predominant type, were induced by word presentations following an initial induction of broadband events, which were temporally separated and selectively correlated with evoked response potentials, suggesting that they reflect different neural activities and play different roles during memory encoding. The two gamma frequency activity types were differentially modulated during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words. In conclusion, we found evidence for two distinct activity types induced in the gamma frequency range during cognitive processing. Separating these two gamma frequency activity components contributes to the current understanding of electrophysiological biomarkers, and may prove useful for emerging neurotechnologies targeting, mapping and modulating distinct neurophysiological processes in normal and epileptogenic brain.", "Keywords": ["ECoG", "evoked response potential", "gamma oscillations", "intracranial EEG", "neuronal ensembles"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Gamma Rhythm", "Humans", "Memory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michal T", "Last Name": "Kucewicz", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent M", "Last Name": "Berry", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vaclav", "Last Name": "Kremen", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin H", "Last Name": "Brinkmann", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Sperling", "Affiliation": "Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Philadelphia PN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara C", "Last Name": "Jobst", "Affiliation": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Department of Neurology, Lebanon NH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert E", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Emory University, Department of Neurosurgery, Atlanta GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Lega", "Affiliation": "University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Neurosurgery, Dallas TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Neurology, New York NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania Hospital, Department of Radiology, Philadelphia PN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandthitsu R", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Gorniak", "Affiliation": "Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Department of Radiology, Philadelphia PN, USA."}, {"First Name": "S Matthew", "Last Name": "Stead", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel S", "Last Name": "Rizzuto", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Psychology, Philadelphia PN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Kahana", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Psychology, Philadelphia PN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Worrell", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Mayo Systems Electrophysiology Laboratory (MSEL), Rochester MN, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2017May01"}, {"PMID": "27935031", "Title": "Interictal epileptiform discharges impair word recall in multiple brain areas.", "Abstract": "Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) have been linked to memory impairment, but the spatial and temporal dynamics of this relationship remain elusive.

The objective of this study was to better understand the factors that influence postacute care decisions by surveying stroke discharge planners. Requests were sent to discharge planners at 471 hospitals in the Northeast United States to complete an online survey regarding the factors impacting the selection of postacute care. Seventy-seven (16%) discharge planners completed the online survey. Respondents were mainly nurses and social workers and 73% reported \u226520 years healthcare experience. Patients and families were found to be significantly more influential than physicians (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and other clinicians (P\u200a=\u200a0.04) in influencing postdischarge care. Other clinicians were significantly more influential than physicians (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Insurance and quality of postacute care were the factors likely to most affect the selection of postacute care facility. Insurance was also identified as the greatest barrier in the selection of level of postacute care (70%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and specific postacute care facility (46%; P\u200a=\u200a0.02).

As such, stem cell biology is emerging as a driving force behind many studies in regenerative medicine. This review focuses on the current understanding of the applications of stem cells in treating ailments of the human brain, with an emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases. Two types of neural stem cells are discussed: endogenous neural stem cells residing within the adult brain and pluripotent stem cells capable of forming neural cells in culture. Endogenous neural stem cells give rise to neurons throughout life, but they are restricted to specialized regions in the brain. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating these cells is key in determining their therapeutic potential as well as finding mechanisms to activate dormant stem cells outside these specialized microdomains. In parallel, patient-derived stem cells can be used to generate neural cells in culture, providing new tools for disease modeling, drug testing, and cell-based therapies. Turning these technologies into viable treatments will require the integration of basic science with clinical skills in rehabilitation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Cohort Studies", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Parkinson Disease", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Prognosis", "Quality of Life", "Recovery of Function", "Regenerative Medicine", "Risk Assessment", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stem Cells", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angel R", "Last Name": "Maldonado-Soto", "Affiliation": "From the Columbia Stem Cell Initiative (ARM-S, DHO, HW, JS, FKD, CEH); Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Neurology and Neuroscience, Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease (ARM-S, DHO, HW, FKD, CEH); Project A.L.S./Jenifer Estess Laboratory for Stem Cell Research (DHO, HW, CEH); and Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine (ARM-S, JS, FKD, CEH), Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Derek H", "Last Name": "Oakley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hynek", "Last Name": "Wichterle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fiona K", "Last Name": "Doetsch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation", "PubDate": "2014Nov"}, {"PMID": "23949043", "Title": "Three upper limb robotic devices for stroke rehabilitation: a review and clinical perspective.", "Abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
